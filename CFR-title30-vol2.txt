                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2006), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

    Source: 53 FR 1217, Jan. 15, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 202.51  Scope and definitions.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to Federal and Indian (Tribal and 
allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage Indian 
Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma) and OCS sulfur leases.
    (b) The definitions in subparts B, C, D, and E, of part 206 of this 
title are applicable to subparts B, C, D, and J of this part.

[53 FR 1217, Jan. 15, 1988, as amended at 64 FR 43513, Aug. 10, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 202.52  Royalties.

    (a) Royalties on oil, gas, and OCS sulfur shall be at the royalty 
rate specified in the lease, unless the Secretary, pursuant to the 
provisions of the applicable mineral leasing laws, reduces, or in the 
case of OCS leases, reduces or eliminates, the royalty rate or net 
profit share set forth in the lease.
    (b) For purposes of this subpart, the use of the term royalty(ies) 
includes the term net profit share(s).


<R05>
Sec. 202.53  Minimum royalty.

    For leases that provide for minimum royalty payments, the lessee 
shall pay the minimum royalty as specified in the lease.


<R04>
                    Subpart C_Federal and Indian Oil


<R05>
Sec. 202.100  Royalty on oil.

    (a) Royalties due on oil production from leases subject to the 
requirements of this part, including condensate separated from gas 
without processing, shall be at the royalty rate established by the 
terms of the lease. Royalty shall be paid in value unless MMS requires 
payment in-kind. When paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, 
for royalty purposes, determined pursuant to part 206 of this title 
multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
    (b)(1) All oil (except oil unavoidably lost or used on, or for the 
benefit of, the lease, including that oil used off-lease for the benefit 
of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the

[[Page 7]]

MMS or BLM, as appropriate) produced from a Federal or Indian lease to 
which this part applies is subject to royalty.
    (2) When oil is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a 
production facility handling production from more than one lease with 
the approval of the MMS or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production 
facility handling unitized or communitized production, only that 
proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) 
necessary to operate the production facility may be used royalty-free.
    (3) Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this section, 
the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) If BLM determines that oil was avoidably lost or wasted from an 
onshore lease, or that oil was drained from an onshore lease for which 
compensatory royalty is due, or if MMS determines that oil was avoidably 
lost or wasted from an offshore lease, then the value of that oil shall 
be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 206.
    (d) If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost 
oil, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This 
paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.
    (e)(1) In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to 
a federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not 
actually take the proportionate share of the agreement production 
attributable to its lease under the terms of the agreement, the full 
share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the 
agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting 
requirements of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section, the value, for royalty purposes, of production 
attributable to unitized or communitized leases will be determined in 
accordance with 30 CFR part 206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR 
part 206, the circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the 
portion of the production to which the lessee was entitled but did not 
take shall be considered as controlling in arriving at the value, for 
royalty purposes, of that portion as though the person actually selling 
or disposing of the production were the lessee of the Federal or Indian 
lease.
    (2) If a Federal or Indian lessee takes less than its proportionate 
share of agreement production, upon request of the lessee MMS may 
authorize a royalty valuation method different from that required by 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purposes of 
these regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which 
royalties are due.
    (3) For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking 
volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any 
month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed 
to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less than their 
proportionate share of the agreement production for that month.
    (4) If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement 
production for any month but royalties are paid on the full volume of 
its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this 
section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior 
periods when the lessee subsequently takes more than its proportionate 
share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a sum of money 
by the other agreement participants to balance its account.
    (f) For production from Federal and Indian leases which are 
committed to federally-approved unitization or communitization 
agreements, upon request of a lessee MMS may establish the value of 
production pursuant to a method other than the method required by the 
regulations in this title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing 
value is consistent with the requirements of the applicable statutes, 
lease terms, and agreement terms; (2) persons with an interest in the 
agreement, including, to the extent practical, royalty interests, are 
given notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation 
method before it is authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons 
with an interest in a Federal or Indian lease committed to the 
agreement, including royalty interests, must agree to use the proposed 
method for valuing production from the agreement for royalty purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 202.150  Royalty on gas.

    (a) Royalties due on gas production from leases subject to the 
requirements of this subpart, except helium produced from Federal 
leases, shall be at the rate established by the terms of the lease. 
Royalty shall be paid in value unless MMS requires payment in kind. When 
paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, for royalty purposes, 
determined pursuant to 30 CFR part 206 of this title multiplied by the 
royalty rate in the lease.
    (b)(1) All gas (except gas unavoidably lost or used on, or for the 
benefit of, the lease, including that gas used off-lease for the benefit 
of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the MMS or BLM, as 
appropriate) produced from a Federal lease to which this subpart applies 
is subject to royalty.
    (2) When gas is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a 
production facility handling production from more than one lease with 
the approval of MMS or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production facility 
handling unitized or communitized production, only that proportionate 
share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to 
operate the production facility may be used royalty free.
    (3) Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this subpart, 
the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) If BLM determines that gas was avoidably lost or wasted from an 
onshore lease, or that gas was drained from an onshore lease for which 
compensatory royalty is due, or if MMS determines that gas was avoidably 
lost or wasted from an OCS lease, then the value of that gas shall be 
determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 206.
    (d) If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost 
gas, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This 
paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.
    (e)(1) In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to 
a Federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not 
actually take the proportionate share of the production attributable to 
its Federal lease under the terms of the agreement, the full share of 
production attributable to the lease under the terms of the agreement 
nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements 
of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, 
the value for royalty purposes of production attributable to unitized or 
communitized leases will be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 
206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR part 206, the circumstances 
involved in the actual disposition of the portion of the production to 
which the lessee was entitled but did not take shall be considered as 
controlling in arriving at the value for royalty purposes of that 
portion, as if the person actually selling or disposing of the 
production were the lessee of the Federal lease.
    (2) If a Federal lessee takes less than its proportionate share of 
agreement production, upon request of the lessee MMS may authorize a 
royalty valuation method different from that required by paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purpose of these 
regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which 
royalties are due.
    (3) For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking 
volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any 
month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed 
to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less

[[Page 9]]

than their proportionate share of the agreement production for that 
month.
    (4) If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement 
production for any month but royalties are paid on the full volume of 
its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this 
section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior 
periods at the time the lessee subsequently takes more than its 
proportionate share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a 
sum of money by the other agreement participants to balance its account.
    (f) For production from Federal leases which are committed to 
federally-approved unitization or communitization agreements, upon 
request of a lessee MMS may establish the value of production pursuant 
to a method other than the method required by the regulations in this 
title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing value is consistent 
with the requirements of the applicable statutes, lease terms and 
agreement terms; (2) to the extent practical, persons with an interest 
in the agreement, including royalty interests, are given notice and an 
opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation method before it is 
authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons with an interest in 
a Federal lease committed to the agreement, including royalty interests, 
must agree to use the proposed method for valuing production from the 
agreement for royalty purposes.

<R05>
Sec. 202.151  Royalty on processed gas.

    (a)(1) A royalty, as provided in the lease, shall be paid on the 
value of:
    (i) Any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty 
settlement without resorting to processing; and
    (ii) Residue gas and all gas plant products resulting from 
processing the gas produced from a lease subject to this subpart.
    (2) MMS shall authorize a processing allowance for the reasonable, 
actual costs of processing the gas produced from Federal leases. 
Processing allowances shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 
206 subpart D for gas production from Federal leases and 30 CFR part 206 
subpart E for gas production from Indian leases.
    (b) A reasonable amount of residue gas shall be allowed royalty free 
for operation of the processing plant, but no allowance shall be made 
for boosting residue gas or other expenses incidental to marketing, 
except as provided in 30 CFR part 206. In those situations where a 
processing plant processes gas from more than one lease, only that 
proportionate share of each lease's residue gas necessary for the 
operation of the processing plant shall be allowed royalty free.
    (c) No royalty is due on residue gas, or any gas plant product 
resulting from processing gas, which is reinjected into a reservoir 
within the same lease, unit area, or communitized area, when the 
reinjection is included in a plan of development or operations and the 
plan has received BLM or MMS approval for onshore or offshore 
operations, respectively, until such time as they are finally produced 
from the reservoir for sale or other disposition off-lease.

Sec. 202.152  Standards for reporting and paying royalties on gas.

    (a)(1) If you are responsible for reporting production or royalties, 
you must:
    (i) Report gas volumes and British thermal unit (Btu) heating 
values, if applicable, under the same degree of water saturation;
    (ii) Report gas volumes in units of 1,000 cubic feet (mcf); and
    (iii) Report gas volumes and Btu heating value at a standard 
pressure base of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) and a 
standard temperature base of 60 [deg]F.
    (2) The frequency and method of Btu measurement as set forth in the 
lessee's contract shall be used to determine Btu heating values for 
reporting purposes. However, the lessee shall measure the Btu value at 
least semiannually by recognized standard industry testing methods even 
if the lessee's contract provides for less frequent measurement.

[[Page 10]]

    (b)(1) Residue gas and gas plant product volumes shall be reported 
as specified in this paragraph.
    (2) Carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen (N<INF>2</INF>), 
helium (He), residue gas, and any other gas marketed as a separate 
product shall be reported by using the same standards specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) Natural gas liquids (NGL) volumes shall be reported in standard 
U.S. gallons (231 cubic inches) at 60 [deg]F.
    (4) Sulfur (S) volumes shall be reported in long tons (2,240

    Source: 56 FR 57275, Nov. 8, 1991, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 202.350  Scope and definitions.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all geothermal resources produced 
from Federal geothermal leases issued pursuant to the Geothermal Steam 
Act of 1970, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).
    (b) The definitions in 30 CFR 206.351 are applicable to this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 202.351  Royalties on geothermal resources.

    (a) Royalties on geothermal resources, including byproduct minerals 
and commercially demineralized water, shall be at the royalty rate(s) 
specified in the lease, unless the Secretary of the Interior temporarily 
waives, suspends, or reduces that rate(s). Royalties shall be paid in 
value. The royalty due shall be the value determined pursuant to subpart 
H of 30 CFR part 206 multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
    (b)(1) Royalties are due on all geothermal resources, except those 
specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that are produced from a 
lease and are sold or utilized by the lessee or are reasonably 
susceptible to sale or utilization by the lessee.
    (2) Geothermal resources that are unavoidably lost, as determined by 
the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and geothermal resources that are 
reinjected prior to use on or off the lease, as approved by BLM, are not 
subject to royalty. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) will allow 
free of royalty a reasonable amount of geothermal energy necessary to 
generate electricity for internal powerplant operations or to generate 
electricity returned to the lease for lease operations. If a powerplant 
uses geothermal production from more than one lease, or uses unitized or 
communitized production, only that proportionate share of each lease's 
production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the powerplant may 
be used royalty free. The MMS will also allow free of royalty a 
reasonable amount of commercially demineralized water necessary for 
powerplant operations or otherwise used on or for the benefit of the 
lease.
    (3) Royalties on byproducts are due at the time the recovered 
byproduct is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. Byproducts 
produced and added to stockpiles or inventory do not require payment of 
royalty until the byproducts are sold, utilized, or otherwise finally 
disposed of. The MMS may ask BLM to increase the lease bond to protect 
the lessor's interest when BLM determines that stockpiles or inventories 
become excessive.
    (c) If BLM determines that geothermal resources (including 
byproducts) were avoidably lost or wasted from the lease, or that 
geothermal resources (including byproducts) were drained from the lease 
for which compensatory royalty is due, the value of those geothermal 
resources shall be determined in accordance with subpart H of 30 CFR 
part 206.

[[Page 11]]

    (d) If a lessee receives insurance or other compensation for 
unavoidably lost geothermal resources (including byproducts), royalties 
at the rates specified in the lease are due on the amount of that 
compensation. This paragraph shall not apply to compensation through 
self-insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 202.352  Minimum royalty.

    In no event shall the lessee's annual royalty payments for any 
producing lease be less than the minimum royalty established by the 
lease.


<R05>
Sec. 202.353  Measurement standards for reporting and paying royalties.

    (a) For geothermal resources used to generate electricity, the 
quantity on which royalty is due shall be reported on Form MMS-2014 
(Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance) as follows:
    (1) For geothermal resources valued under arm's-length or non-arm's-
length contracts, quantities shall be reported in:
    (i) Kilowatthours to the nearest whole kilowatthour if the contract 
specifies payment in terms of generated electricity,
    (ii) Thousands of pounds to the nearest whole thousand pounds if the 
contract specifies payment in terms of weight, or
    (iii) Millions of Btu's to the nearest whole million Btu if the 
contract specifies payment in terms of heat or thermal energy.
    (2) For geothermal resources valued by the netback procedure 
pursuant to 30 CFR 206.352(c)(1)(ii) or (d)(1)(ii), the quantities shall 
be reported in kilowatthours to the nearest whole kilowatthour.
    (b) For geothermal resources used in direct utilization processes, 
the quantity on which royalty is due shall be reported on Form MMS-2014 
in:
    (1) Millions of Btu's to the nearest whole million Btu if valuation 
is in terms of thermal energy used or displaced,
    (2) Hundreds of gallons to the nearest hundred gallons of geothermal 
fluid produced if valuation is in terms of volume, or
    (3) Other measurement unit approved by MMS for valuation and 
reporting purposes.
    (c) For byproduct minerals, the quantity on which royalty is due 
shall be reported on Form MMS-2014 consistent with MMS-established 
reporting standards.
    (d) For commercially demineralized water, the quantity on which 
royalty is due shall be reported on Form MMS-2014 in hundreds of gallons 
to the nearest hundred gallons.
    (e) Lessees are not required to report the quality of geothermal 
resources, including byproducts, to MMS. The lessee must maintain 
quality measurements for audit and valuation purposes. Quality 
measurements include, but are not limited to, temperatures and chemical 
analyses for fluid geothermal resources and chemical analyses, weight 
percent, or other purity measurements for byproducts.

               Subpart J_Gas Production From Indian Leases

    Source: 64 FR 43514, Aug. 10, 1999, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 202.550  How do I determine the royalty due on gas production?

    If you produce gas from an Indian lease subject to this subpart, you 
must determine and pay royalties on gas production as specified in this 
section.
    (a) Royalty rate. You must calculate your royalty using the royalty 
rate in the lease.
    (b) Payment in value or in kind. You must pay royalty in value 
unless:
    (1) The Tribal lessor requires payment in kind; or
    (2) You have a lease on allotted lands and MMS requires payment in 
kind.
    (c) Royalty calculation. You must use the following calculations to 
determine royalty due on the production from or attributable to your 
lease.
    (1) When paid in value, the royalty due is the unit value of 
production for royalty purposes, determined under 30 CFR part 206, 
multiplied by the volume of production multiplied by the royalty rate in 
the lease.
    (2) When paid in kind, the royalty due is the volume of production 
multiplied by the royalty rate.

[[Page 12]]

    (d) Reduced royalty rate. The Indian lessor and the Secretary may 
approve a request for a royalty rate reduction. In your request you must 
demonstrate economic hardship.
    (e) Reporting and paying. You must report and pay royalties as 
provided in part 218 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 202.551  How do I determine the volume of production for which I 
must pay royalty if my lease is not in an approved Federal unit or 
communitization agreement (AFA)?

    (a) You are liable for royalty on your entitled share of gas 
production from your Indian lease, except as provided in Sec. Sec. 
202.555, 202.556, and 202.557.
    (b) You and all other persons paying royalties on the lease must 
report and pay royalties based on your takes. If another person takes 
some of your entitled share but does not pay the royalties owed, you are 
liable for those royalties.
    (c) You and all other persons paying royalties on the lease may ask 
MMS for permission to report and pay royalties based on your 
entitlements. In that event, MMS will provide valuation instructions 
consistent with this part and part 206 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 202.552  How do I determine how much royalty I must pay if my lease 
is in an approved Federal unit or communitization agreement (AFA)?

    You must pay royalties each month on production allocated to your 
lease under the terms of an AFA. To determine the volume and the value 
of your production, you must follow these three steps:
    (a) You must determine the volume of your entitled share of 
production allocated to your lease under the terms of an AFA. This may 
include production from more than one AFA.
    (b) You must value the production you take using 30 CFR part 206. If 
you take more than your entitled share of production, see Sec. 202.553 
for information on how to value this production. If you take less than 
your entitled share of production, see Sec. 202.554 for information on 
how to value production you are entitled to but do not take.


<R05>
Sec. 202.553  How do I value my production if I take more than my 
entitled share?

    If you take more than your entitled share of production from a lease 
in an AFA for any month, you must determine the weighted-average value 
of all of the production that you take using the procedures in 30 CFR 
part 206, and use that value for your entitled share of production.


<R05>
Sec. 202.554  How do I value my production that I do not take if I take 
less than my entitled share?

    If you take none or only part of your entitled production from a 
lease in an AFA for any month, use this section to value the production 
that you are entitled to but do not take.
    (a) If you take a significant volume of production from your lease 
during the month, you must determine the weighted average value of the 
production that you take using 30 CFR part 206, and use that value for 
the production that you do not take.
    (b) If you do not take a significant volume of production from your 
lease during the month, you must use paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section, whichever applies.
    (c) In a month where you do not take production or take an 
insignificant volume, and if you would have used Sec. 206.172(b) to 
value the production if you had taken it, you must determine the value 
of production not taken for that month under Sec. 206.172(b) as if you 
had taken it.
    (d) If you take none of your entitled share of production from a 
lease in an AFA, and if that production cannot be valued under Sec. 
206.172(b), then you must determine the value of the production that you 
do not take using the first of the following methods that applies:
    (1) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 
CFR part 206) in that month from other leases in the same AFA.
    (2) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 
CFR part 206) in that month from other leases in the same field or area.
    (3) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 
CFR part 206) during the previous month for production from leases in 
the same AFA.

[[Page 13]]

    (4) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 
CFR part 206) during the previous month for production from other leases 
in the same field or area.
    (5) The latest major portion value that you received from MMS 
calculated under 30 CFR 206.174 for the same MMS-designated area.
    (e) You may take less than your entitled share of AFA production for 
any month, but pay royalties on the full volume of your entitled share 
under this section. If you do, you will owe no additional royalty for 
that lease for that month when you later take more than your entitled 
share to balance your account. The provisions of this paragraph (e) also 
apply when the other AFA participants pay you money to balance your 
account.


<R05>
Sec. 202.555  What portion of the gas that I produce is subject to 
royalty?

    (a) All gas produced from or allocated to your Indian lease is 
subject to royalty except the following:
    (1) Gas that is unavoidably lost.
    (2) Gas that is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease.
    (3) Gas that is used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approves such off-lease use.
    (4) Gas used as plant fuel as provided in 30 CFR 206.179(e).
    (b) You may use royalty-free only that proportionate share of each 
lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the 
production facility when you use gas for one of the following purposes:
    (1) On, or for the benefit of, the lease at a production facility 
handling production from more than one lease with BLM's approval.
    (2) At a production facility handling unitized or communitized 
production.
    (c) If the terms of your lease are inconsistent with this subpart, 
your lease terms will govern to the extent of that inconsistency.


<R05>
Sec. 202.556  How do I determine the value of avoidably lost, wasted, 
or drained gas?

    If BLM determines that a volume of gas was avoidably lost or wasted, 
or a volume of gas was drained from your Indian lease for which 
compensatory royalty is due, then you must determine the value of that 
volume of gas under 30 CFR part 206.


<R05>
Sec. 202.557  Must I pay royalty on insurance compensation for 
unavoidably lost gas?

    If you receive insurance compensation for unavoidably lost gas, you 
must pay royalties on the amount of that compensation. This paragraph 
does not apply to compensation through self-insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 202.558  What standards do I use to report and pay royalties on gas?

    (a) You must report gas volumes as follows:
    (1) Report gas volumes and Btu heating values, if applicable, under 
the same degree of water saturation. Report gas volumes and Btu heating 
value at a standard pressure base of 14.73 psia and a standard 
temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Report gas volumes in units of 
1,000 cubic feet (Mcf).
    (2) You must use the frequency and method of Btu measurement stated 
in your contract to determine Btu heating values for reporting purposes. 
However, you must measure the Btu value at least semi-annually by 
recognized standard industry testing methods even if your contract 
provides for less frequent measurement.
    (b) You must report residue gas and gas plant product volumes as 
follows:
    (1) Report carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen 
(N<INF>2</INF>), helium (He), residue gas, and any gas marketed as a 
separate product by using the same standards specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (2) Report natural gas liquid (NGL) volumes in standard U.S. gallons 
(231 cubic inches) at 60 degrees F.
    (3) Report sulfur (S) volumes in long tons (2,240 pounds).

    Source: 63 FR 2616, Jan. 16, 1998, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 203.0  What definitions apply to this part?

    Authorized field means a field:
    (1) Located in a water depth of at least 200 meters and in the Gulf 
of Mexico (GOM) west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude;
    (2) That includes one or more pre-Act leases; and
    (3) From which no current pre-Act lease produced, other than test 
production, before November 28, 1995.
    Certified unsuccessful well means an original well, or a sidetrack 
with a sidetrack measured depth of at least 10,000 feet, on your lease 
that:
    (1) You begin drilling on or after March 26, 2003, and before May 3, 
2009, and before your lease produces gas or oil from a deep well with a 
perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet true 
vertical depth below the datum at mean sea level (TVD SS);
    (2) You drill to at least 18,000 feet TVD SS with a target reservoir 
on your lease, identified from seismic and related data, deeper than 
that depth;
    (3) Fails to meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 250, 
subpart A, and does not produce gas or oil, or the MMS agrees is not 
commercially producible; and
    (4) For which you have provided the notices and information in Sec. 
203.46.
    Complete application means an original and two copies of the six 
reports consisting of the data specified in 30 CFR 203.81, 203.83 and 
203.85 through 203.89, along with one set of digital information, which 
MMS has reviewed and found complete.
    Deep well means either an original well or a sidetrack with a 
perforated interval the top of which is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS. A 
deep well subsequently re-perforated less than 15,000 feet TVD SS in the 
same reservoir is still a deep well.
    Determination means the binding decision by MMS on whether your 
field qualifies for relief or how large a royalty-suspension volume must 
be to make the field economically viable.
    Development project means a project to develop one or more oil or 
gas reservoirs located on one or more contiguous leases that:
    (1) Were issued in a sale held after November 28, 2000;
    (2) Are located in a water depth of at least 200 meters and in the 
GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; and
    (3) Have had no production (other than test production) before the 
current application for royalty relief.
    Draft application means the preliminary set of information and 
assumptions you submit to seek a nonbinding assessment on whether a 
field could be expected to qualify for royalty relief.
    Eligible lease means a lease that:
    (1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 
1995, and before November 28, 2000;
    (2) Is located in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths of 200 meters 
or deeper;
    (3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; and
    (4) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension volume.
    Expansion project means a project you propose in a Development 
Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or a Supplement approved by the 
Secretary of the Interior after November 28, 1995, that will 
significantly increase the ultimate recovery of resources from one or 
more reservoirs that have not produced on a pre-Act lease or a lease 
issued in a sale held after November 28,

[[Page 16]]

2000. A significant increase does not simply extend recovery from 
reservoirs already in production. For a pre-Act lease, the expansion 
project must also involve a substantial capital investment (e.g., fixed-
leg platform, subsea template and manifold, tension-leg platform, 
multiple well project, etc.). For a lease issued after November 28, 
2000, the expansion project must involve a new well drilled into a 
reservoir that has not previously produced. In all cases, all leases in 
an expansion project must be wholly located in a water depth of at least 
200 meters and in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West 
longitude.
    Fabrication (or start of construction) means evidence of an 
irreversible commitment to a concept and scale of development. Evidence 
includes copies of a binding contract between you (as applicant) and a 
fabrication yard, a letter from a fabricator certifying that continuous 
construction has begun, and a receipt for the customary down payment.
    Field means an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple 
reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same general geological 
structural feature or stratigraphic trapping condition. Two or more 
reservoirs may be in a field, separated vertically by intervening 
impervious strata or laterally by local geologic barriers, or both.
    Lease means a lease or unit.
    New production means any production from a current pre-Act lease 
from which no royalties are due on production, other than test 
production, before November 28, 1995. Also, it means any additional 
production resulting from new lease-development activities on a lease 
issued in a sale after November 28, 2000, or a current pre-Act lease 
under a DOCD or a Supplement approved by the Secretary of the Interior 
after November, 28, 1995.
    Nonbinding assessment means an opinion by MMS of whether your field 
could qualify for royalty relief. It is based on your draft application 
and does not entitle the field to relief.
    Original well means a well that is drilled without utilizing an 
existing wellbore. An original well includes all sidetracks drilled from 
the original wellbore before the drilling rig moves off the well 
location. A bypass from an original well (e.g., drilling around material 
blocking the hole or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the 
original well.
    Participating area means that part of the unit area that MMS 
determines is reasonably proven by drilling and completion of producible 
wells, geological and geophysical information, and engineering data to 
be capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities.
    Performance conditions means minimum conditions you must meet, after 
we have granted relief and before production begins, to remain qualified 
for that relief. If you do not meet each one of these performance 
conditions, we consider it a change in material fact significant enough 
to invalidate our original evaluation and approval.
    Pre-Act lease means a lease that:
    (1) Results from a sale held before November 28, 1995;
    (2) Is located in the GOM in water depths of 200 meters or deeper; 
and
    (3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.
    Production means all oil, gas, and other relevant products you save, 
remove, or sell from a tract or those quantities allocated to your tract 
under a unitization formula, as measured for the purposes of determining 
the amount of royalty payable to the United States.
    Project means any activity that requires at least a permit to drill.
    Qualified well means a deep well:
    (1) For which drilling begins on or after March 26, 2003;
    (2) That produces natural gas (other than test production), 
including gas associated with oil production, before May 3, 2009; and
    (3) For which you have met the requirements prescribed in Sec. 
203.43.
    Redetermination means our reconsideration of our determination on 
royalty relief because you request it after:
    (1) We have rejected your application;
    (2) We have granted relief but you want a larger suspension volume;
    (3) We withdraw approval; or
    (4) You renounce royalty relief.
    Renounce means action you take to give up relief after we have 
granted it and before you start production.

[[Page 17]]

    Reservoir means an underground accumulation of oil or natural gas, 
or both, characterized by a single pressure system and segregated from 
other such accumulations.
    Royalty suspension (RS) lease means a lease that:
    (1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 
2000;
    (2) Is in locations or planning areas specified in a particular 
Notice of OCS Lease Sale offering that lease; and
    (3) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension specified in a Notice 
of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register.
    Royalty suspension supplement means a royalty suspension volume 
resulting from drilling a certified unsuccessful well that is applied to 
future natural gas and oil production generated at any drilling depth 
on, or allocated under an MMS-approved unit agreement to, the same 
lease.
    Royalty suspension volume means a volume of production from a lease 
that is not subject to royalty under the provisions of this part.
    Sidetrack means, for the purpose of this subpart, a well resulting 
from drilling an additional hole to a new objective bottom-hole location 
by leaving a previously drilled hole. A sidetrack also includes drilling 
a well from a platform slot reclaimed from a previously drilled well or 
re-entering and deepening a previously drilled well. A bypass from a 
sidetrack (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole, or to 
straighten crooked holes) is part of the sidetrack.
    Sidetrack measured depth means the actual distance or length in feet 
a sidetrack is drilled beginning where it exits a previously drilled 
hole to the bottom hole of the sidetrack, that is, to its total depth.
    Sunk costs for an authorized field means the after-tax eligible 
costs that you (not third parties) incur for exploration, development, 
and production from the spud date of the first discovery on the field to 
the date we receive your complete application for royalty relief. The 
discovery well must be qualified as producible under part 250, subpart A 
of this title. Sunk costs include the rig mobilization and material 
costs for the discovery well that you incurred before its spud date.
    Sunk costs for an expansion or development project means the after-
tax eligible costs that you (not third parties) incur for only the first 
well that encounters hydrocarbons in the reservoir(s) included in the 
application and that meets the producibility requirements under part 
250, subpart A of this chapter on each lease participating in the 
application. Sunk costs include rig mobilization and material costs for 
the discovery wells that you incurred before their spud dates.
    Withdraw means action we take on a field that has qualified for 
relief if you have not met one or more of the performance conditions.

Sec. 203.1  What is MMS's authority to grant royalty relief?

    The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337, as 
amended by the OCS Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA), Public Law 
104-58, authorizes us to grant royalty relief in three situations.
    (a) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(A), we may reduce or eliminate any 
royalty or a net profit share specified for an OCS lease to promote 
increased production.
    (b) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(B), we may reduce, modify, or 
eliminate any royalty or net profit share to promote development, 
increase production, or encourage production of marginal resources on 
certain leases or categories of leases. This authority is restricted to 
leases in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) that are west of 87 degrees, 30 
minutes West longitude.
    (c) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), we may suspend royalties for 
designated volumes of new production from any lease if:
    (1) Your lease is in deep water (water at least 200 meters deep);
    (2) Your lease is in designated areas of the GOM (west of 87 
degrees, 30 minutes West longitude);
    (3) Your lease was acquired in a lease sale held before the DWRRA 
(before November 28, 1995);

[[Page 18]]

    (4) We find that your new production would not be economic without 
royalty relief; and
    (5) Your lease is on a field that did not produce before enactment 
of the DWRRA, or if you propose a project to significantly expand 
production under a Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) 
or a supplementary DOCD, that MMS approved after November 28, 1995.


<R05>
Sec. 203.2  How can I get royalty relief?

    We may reduce or suspend royalties for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) 
leases or projects that meet the criteria in the following table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<R05>
Sec. 203.3  Why must I pay a fee to request royalty relief?

    (a) When you submit an application or ask for a preview assessment, 
you must include a fee to reimburse us for our costs of processing your 
application or assessment. Federal policy and law require us to recover 
the cost of services that confer special benefits to identifiable non-
Federal recipients. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act (31 U.S.C. 
9701), Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25, and the Omnibus 
Appropriations Bill (Pub. L. 104-133, 110 Stat. 1321, April 26, 1996) 
authorize us to collect these fees.
    (b) We will specify the necessary fees for each of the types of 
royalty-relief applications and possible MMS audits in a Notice to 
Lessees. We will periodically update the fees to reflect changes in 
costs as well as provide other information necessary to administer 
royalty relief.


<R05>
Sec. 203.4  How do the provisions in this part apply to different types 
of leases and projects?

    The tables in this section summarize the similar application and 
approval provisions for the discretionary end-of-life and deep water 
royalty relief programs in Sec. Sec. 203.50 to 203.91. Because royalty 
relief for deep gas on leases not subject to deep water royalty relief, 
as provided for under Sec. Sec. 203.40 to 203.48, does not involve an 
application, its provisions do not parallel the other two royalty relief 
programs and are not summarized in this section.
    (a) We require the information elements indicated by an X in the 
following table and described in Sec. Sec. 203.51, 203.62, and 203.81 
through 203.89 for applications for royalty relief.

 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS.  (rounded to the nearest 100
                                          feet) but no more than 15 BCF.
(3) An original well with a perforated   25 BCF.
 interval the top of which is 18,000
 feet TVD SS or deeper.
(4) A sidetrack with a perforated        4 BCF plus 600 MCF times
 interval the top of which is 18,000      sidetrack measured depth
 feet TVD SS or deeper.                   (rounded to the nearest 100
                                          feet) but no more than 25 BCF.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) We will suspend royalties on gas volumes produced on or after 
May 3, 2004, reported on the Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part A 
(OGOR-A) for your lease under Sec. 216.53, as and to the extent 
prescribed in Sec. 203.42. All gas production from qualified wells 
reported on the OGOR-A, including production that is not subject to 
royalty (except for production to which a royalty suspension supplement 
under Sec. Sec. 203.44 and 203.45 applies), counts toward the lease 
royalty suspension volume.

    Example 1. If you have a qualified well that is an original well 
with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, you 
earn a royalty suspension volume of 15 BCF of gas production from 
qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in Sec. 203.42. However, 
if the top of the perforated interval is 18,500 feet TVD SS, the royalty 
suspension volume is 25 BCF.

[[Page 22]]

    Example 2. If you have a qualified well that is a sidetrack with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, that has a 
sidetrack measured depth of 6,789 feet, we round the distance to 6,800 
feet and you earn a royalty suspension volume of 8.08 BCF of gas 
production from qualified wells on your lease, as prescribed in Sec. 
203.42.
    Example 3. If you have a qualified well that is a sidetrack with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, that has a 
sidetrack measured depth of 19,500 feet, you earn a royalty suspension 
volume of 15 BCF of gas production from qualified wells on your lease, 
as prescribed in Sec. 203.42, even though 4 BCF plus 600 MCF per foot 
of sidetrack measured depth equals 15.7 BCF.

    (c) This paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section apply if your 
lease has produced gas or oil from a deep well with a perforated 
interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS 
(regardless of whether drilling began before or after March 26, 2003), 
and you subsequently have a qualified well on your lease with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD or deeper. 
Subject to the administrative requirements of Sec. 203.43, the 
provisions of Sec. 203.44(d), and the price conditions in Sec.  203.47, 
you earn a royalty suspension volume specified in the following table, 
applicable to gas production as prescribed in Sec. 203.42. This royalty 
suspension volume is in addition to any royalty suspension volume your 
lease already may have earned, if any, as a result of a qualified well 
with a perforated interval the top of which is from 15,000 to less than 
18,000 feet TVD SS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 If your lease has produced gas or oil
   from a deep well with a perforated        Then, you earn a royalty
   interval the top of which is from        suspension volume on this
15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS,    amount of gas production, as
 and you subsequently have a qualified    prescribed in this section and
           well that is . . .                     Sec.  203.42
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) An original well or a sidetrack      0 BCF.
 with a perforated interval the top of
 which is from 15,000 to less than
 18,000 feet TVD SS.
(2) An original well with a perforated   10 BCF.
 interval the top of which is 18,000
 feet TVD SS or deeper.
(3) A sidetrack with a perforated        4 BCF plus 600 MCF times
 interval the top of which is 18,000      sidetrack measured depth
 feet TVD SS or deeper.                   (rounded to the nearest 100
                                          feet) but no more than 10 BCF.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) We will suspend royalties on gas volumes produced on or after 
May 3, 2004, reported on the Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part A 
(OGOR-A) for your lease under Sec. 216.53, as and to the extent 
prescribed in Sec. 203.42. All gas production from qualified wells 
reported on the OGOR-A, including production that is not subject to 
royalty (except for production to which a royalty suspension supplement 
under Sec. Sec. 203.44 and 203.45 applies), counts toward the lease 
royalty suspension volume.

    Example 1. If you have drilled and produced a well with a perforated 
interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD SS before March 26, 2003 
(and therefore, it is not a qualified well and has earned no royalty 
suspension volume) and later drill:
    (i) A well with a perforated interval the top of which is 17,000 
feet TVD SS, you earn no royalty suspension volume.
    (ii) A qualified well that is an original well with a perforated 
interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, you earn a royalty 
suspension volume of 10 BCF of gas production from qualified wells on 
your lease, as prescribed in Sec. 203.42.
    (iii) A qualified well that is a sidetrack with a perforated 
interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack 
measured depth of 7,000 feet, you earn a royalty suspension volume of 
8.2 BCF of gas production from qualified wells on your lease, as 
prescribed in Sec. 203.42.
    Example 2. If you have a qualified well (i.e., drilled after March 
26, 2003) that is an original well with a perforated interval the top of 
which is 16,000 feet TVD SS and later drill a second qualified well that 
is an original well with a perforated interval the top of which is 
19,000 feet TVD SS, we increase the total royalty suspension volume for 
your lease from 15 BCF to 25 BCF, as prescribed in Sec. 203.42.
    Example 3. If you have a qualified well (i.e., drilled after March 
26, 2003) that is a sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of 
which is 16,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack measured depth of 
4,000 feet, and later drill a second qualified well that is a sidetrack 
with a perforated interval the top of which is 19,000 feet TVD SS, that 
has a sidetrack measured depth of 8,000 feet, we increase the total 
royalty suspension volume for your lease from 6.4 BCF to 15.2 BCF, as 
prescribed in Sec. 203.42. The difference of 8.8 BCF represents the 
royalty suspension volume earned by the second sidetrack.


[[Page 23]]


    (e) After your lease has produced gas or oil from a deep well with a 
perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper, 
your lease cannot earn a royalty suspension volume as a result of 
drilling any subsequent qualified wells.
    (f) The royalty suspension volume determined under this section for 
the first qualified well on your lease (whether an original well or a 
sidetrack) establishes the total royalty suspension volume available for 
that drilling depth interval on your lease, regardless of the number of 
subsequent qualified wells you drill to that depth interval.

    Example to paragraph (f): If your first qualified well is a 
sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is 16,000 feet TVD 
SS and earns a royalty suspension volume of 12.5 BCF, and you later 
drill a qualified original well to 17,000 feet TVD SS, the royalty 
suspension volume for your lease remains at 12.5 BCF and does not 
increase to 15 BCF. However, under paragraph (b) of this section, if you 
subsequently drill a qualified well to another depth interval 18,000 
feet or greater TVD SS, you may earn an additional royalty suspension 
volume.

    (g) If a qualified well on your lease is within a unitized portion 
of your lease, the royalty suspension volume earned by that well under 
this section applies only to your lease and not to other leases within 
the unit.
    (h) If your qualified well is a directional well (either an original 
well or a sidetrack) drilled across a lease line, the lease with the 
perforated interval that initially produces earns the royalty suspension 
volume. However, if the perforated interval crosses a lease line, the 
lease where the surface of the well is located earns the royalty 
suspension volume.
    (i) Any royalty suspension volume earned under this section is in 
addition to any royalty suspension supplement for your lease under Sec. 
203.44 that results from a different wellbore.
    (j) If your lease earns a royalty suspension volume under this 
section and later produces from a deep well that is not a qualified 
well, the royalty suspension volume is not forfeited or terminated. 
However, you may not apply the royalty suspension volume under this 
section to production from the deep well that is not a qualified well, 
even if it begins producing after your first qualified well.
    (k) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your 
lease terms notwithstanding any royalty suspension volumes allowed under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 203.42  To which production do I apply the royalty suspension 
volume earned from qualified wells on my lease?

    (a) This paragraph applies to any lease that is not within an MMS-
approved unit. Subject to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 203.40, 203.41, 
203.43, 203.44, and 203.47, you must apply the royalty suspension 
volumes prescribed in Sec. 203.41 to the earliest gas production:
    (1) Occurring on and after the later of May 3, 2004, or the date 
that the first qualified well that earns your lease the royalty 
suspension volume begins production (other than test production);
    (2) From all qualified wells, regardless of their depth, on your 
lease for which you have met the requirements in Sec. 203.43, up to the 
aggregate royalty suspension volume earned by your lease.

    Example to paragraph (a): You began drilling an original well that 
was a qualified well with a perforated interval the top of which is 
18,200 feet TVD SS on May 1, 2003 and it began producing on September 1, 
2003. You subsequently drilled two more original wells that are 
qualified wells with a perforated interval the tops of which are 16,600 
feet TVD SS. The first well earned a royalty suspension volume of 25 
BCF. You must apply the royalty suspension volume each month beginning 
on March 1, 2004 to production from all three wells until the 25 BCF 
royalty suspension volume is fully utilized.

    (b) This paragraph applies to any lease all or part of which is 
within an MMS-approved unit. If your lease has a qualified well, a share 
of the production from all the qualified wells in the unit participating 
area will be allocated to your lease each month according to the 
participating area percentages. Subject to the requirements of 
Sec. Sec. 203.40, 203.41, 203.43, 203.44, and 203.47, you must apply 
the royalty suspension volume to the earliest gas production occurring 
on and after the later of May

[[Page 24]]

3, 2004, or the date that the first qualified well that earns your lease 
the royalty suspension volume begins production (other than test 
production):
    (1) From all qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease 
and
    (2) Allocated to your lease from qualified wells on unitized areas 
of your lease and other leases in the unit under an MMS-approved unit 
agreement. That allocated share does not increase the royalty suspension 
volume for your lease. None of the volumes produced from a well that is 
not within a unit participating area may be allocated to other leases in 
the unit.

    Example to paragraph (b): The east half of your lease A is unitized 
with all of lease B. There is one qualified well on the non-unitized 
portion of lease A, one qualified well on the unitized portion of lease 
A and a qualified well on lease B. The participating area percentages 
allocate 32 percent of production from both of the unit qualified wells 
to lease A and 68 percent to lease B. If the non-unitized qualified well 
on lease A produces 12,000 MCF and the unitized qualified well on lease 
A produces 15,000 MCF, and the qualified well on lease B produces 10,000 
MCF, then the production volume from and allocated to lease A to which 
the lease A royalty suspension volume applies is 20,000 MCF [12,000 + 
(15,000 + 10,000)(32 percent)]. The production volume allocated to lease 
B to which the lease B royalty suspension volume applies is 17,000 MCF 
[(15,000 + 10,000)(68 percent)].

    (c) Unused royalty suspension volume transfers to a successor lessee 
and expires with the lease.
    (d) You may not apply the royalty suspension volume allowed under 
Sec. 203.41:
    (1) To production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, 
except in cases where the qualified well is re-perforated in the same 
reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;
    (2) To production from a deep well that commenced drilling before 
March 26, 2003; or
    (3) To production from a deep well on any other lease, except as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (e) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production 
of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your 
lease under paragraph (b) of this section, reaches the applicable 
royalty suspension volume allowed under Sec. 203.41. For the month in 
which cumulative production reaches this royalty suspension volume, you 
owe royalties on the portion of gas production that exceeds the royalty 
suspension volume remaining at the beginning of that month.
    (f) No royalty suspension volume may be applied to any liquid 
hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes.

[69 FR 3510, Jan. 26, 2004, as amended at 69 FR 24054, Apr. 30, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 203.43  What administrative steps must I take to use the royalty 
suspension volume?

    (a) You must notify, in writing, the MMS Regional Supervisor for 
Production and Development of your intent to begin drilling operations 
on all deep wells; and
    (b) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from all wells 
that would become qualified wells by satisfying the requirements of this 
section, you must:
    (1) Provide written notification to the MMS Regional Supervisor for 
Production and Development that production has begun; and
    (2) Request confirmation of the size of the royalty suspension 
volume earned by your lease.
    (c) Before beginning production, you must meet any production 
measurement requirements that the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production 
and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, 
subpart L.
    (d) If you produced from a qualified well before May 3, 2004, you 
must provide the information in paragraph (b) of this section no later 
than August 3, 2004.
    (e) If you cannot produce from a well that otherwise meets the 
criteria for a qualified well before May 3, 2009, the MMS Regional 
Supervisor for Production and Development may extend the deadline for 
beginning production for up to 1 year, based on the circumstances of the 
particular well involved, provided you demonstrate that:
    (1) The delay occurred after reaching total depth in your well;
    (2) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin 
before March 1, 2009; and

[[Page 25]]

    (3) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your 
control, including but not limited to adverse weather and unavoidable 
accidents.

<R05>
Sec. 203.44  If I drill a certified unsuccessful well, what royalty 
relief will my lease earn?

    Your lease may earn a royalty suspension supplement. Subject to 
paragraph (d) of this section, the royalty suspension supplement is in 
addition to any royalty suspension volume your lease may earn under 
Sec. 203.41.
    (a) If you drill a certified unsuccessful well and you satisfy the 
administrative requirements of Sec. 203.46 and subject to the price 
conditions in Sec. 203.47, you earn a royalty suspension supplement 
shown in the following table (in billions of cubic feet of gas 
equivalent (BCFE) or in thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent 
(MCFE)) applicable to oil and gas production as prescribed in Sec. 
204.45:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             Then, you earn a royalty
                                          suspension supplement on this
  If you have a certified unsuccessful        volume of oil and gas
           well that is . . .              production as prescribed in
                                         this section and Sec.  203.45:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) An original well and your lease has  5 BCFE.
 not produced gas or oil from a deep
 well.
(2) A sidetrack (with a sidetrack        0.8 BCFE plus 120 MCFE times
 measured depth of at least 10,000        sidetrack measured depth
 feet) and your lease has not produced    (rounded to the nearest 100
 gas or oil from a deep well.             feet) but no more than 5 BCFE.
(3) An original well or a sidetrack      2 BCFE.
 (with a sidetrack measured depth of at
 least 10,000 feet) and your lease has
 produced gas or oil from a deep well
 with a perforated interval the top of
 which is from 15,000 to less than
 18,000 feet TVD SS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) We will suspend royalties on oil and gas volumes produced on or 
after May 3, 2004, reported on the Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part A 
(OGOR-A) for your lease under Sec. 216.53, as and to the extent 
prescribed in Sec. 203.45. All oil and gas production reported on the 
OGOR-A, including production that is not subject to royalty (except for 
production to which a royalty suspension volume under Sec. Sec. 203.41 
and 203.42 applies), counts toward the lease royalty suspension 
supplement.

    Example 1. If you drill a certified unsuccessful well that is an 
original well to a target 19,000 feet TVD SS, you earn a royalty 
suspension supplement of 5 BCFE of gas and oil production if your lease 
has not previously produced from a deep well, or you earn a royalty 
suspension supplement of 2 BCFE of gas and oil production if your lease 
has previously produced from a deep well with a perforated interval from 
15,000 to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS, as prescribed in Sec. 203.45.
    Example 2. If you drill a certified unsuccessful well that is a 
sidetrack that reaches a target 19,000 feet TVD SS, that has a sidetrack 
measured depth of 12,545 feet, and your lease has not produced gas or 
oil from any deep well, we round the distance to 12,500 feet and you 
earn a royalty suspension supplement of 2.3 BCFE of gas and oil 
production as prescribed in Sec. 203.45.

    (c) The conversion from oil to gas for using the royalty suspension 
supplement is specified in Sec. 203.73.
    (d) Each lease is eligible for up to two royalty suspension 
supplements. Therefore, the total royalty suspension supplement for a 
lease cannot exceed 10 BCFE.
    (1) You may not earn more than one royalty suspension supplement 
from a single wellbore.
    (2) If you begin drilling a certified unsuccessful well on one lease 
but the completion target is on a second lease, the entire royalty 
suspension supplement belongs to the second lease. However, if the 
target straddles a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well 
is located earns the royalty suspension supplement.
    (e) If the same wellbore that earns a royalty suspension supplement 
as a certified unsuccessful well later produces from a perforated 
interval the top of which is 15,000 feet TVD SS or deeper before May 3, 
2009, it will become a qualified well subject to the following 
conditions:
    (1) Beginning on the date production starts, you must stop applying 
the royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore to your lease 
production.

[[Page 26]]

    (2) If the completion of this qualified well is on your lease or, in 
the case of a directional well, is on another lease, then you must 
subtract from the royalty suspension volume earned by that qualified 
well the royalty suspension supplement amounts earned by that wellbore 
that have already been applied either on your lease or any other lease. 
The difference represents the royalty suspension volume earned by the 
qualified well.
    (f) If the same wellbore that earned a royalty suspension supplement 
later has a sidetrack drilled from that wellbore, you are not required 
to subtract any royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore 
from the royalty suspension volume that may be earned by the sidetrack.
    (g) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your 
lease terms notwithstanding any royalty suspension supplements under 
this section.

[69 FR 3510, Jan. 26, 2004, as amended at 69 FR 24054, Apr. 30, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 203.45  To which production do I apply the royalty suspension 
supplements from drilling one or two certified unsuccessful wells 
on my lease?

    (a) Subject to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 203.40, 203.42, 
203.44, 203.46 and 203.47, you must apply royalty suspension supplements 
in Sec. 203.44 to the earliest oil and gas production:
    (1) Occurring on and after the day you file the information under 
Sec. 203.46(b),
    (2) From, or allocated under an MMS-approved unit agreement to, the 
lease on which the certified unsuccessful well was drilled, without 
regard to the drilling depth of the well producing the gas or oil.
    (b) If you have a royalty suspension volume for the lease under 
Sec. 203.41, you must use the royalty suspension volumes for gas 
produced from qualified wells on the lease before using royalty 
suspension supplements for gas produced from qualified wells.

    Example to paragraph (b): You have two shallow oil wells on your 
lease. Then you drill a certified unsuccessful well and earn a royalty 
suspension supplement of 5 BCFE. Thereafter, you begin production from 
an original well that is a qualified well that earns a royalty 
suspension volume of 15 BCF. You use only 2 BCFE of the royalty 
suspension supplement before the oil wells deplete. You must use up the 
15 BCF of royalty suspension volume before you use the remaining 3 BCFE 
of the royalty suspension supplement for gas produced from the qualified 
well.

    (c) If you have no current production on which to apply the royalty 
suspension supplement allowed under Sec. 203.44, your royalty 
suspension supplement applies to the earliest subsequent production of 
gas and oil from, or allocated under an MMS-approved unit agreement to, 
your lease.
    (d) Unused royalty suspension supplements transfer to a successor 
lessee and expire with the lease.
    (e) You may not apply the royalty suspension supplement allowed 
under Sec. 203.44 to production from any other lease, except for 
production allocated to your lease from an MMS-approved unit agreement. 
If your certified unsuccessful well is on a lease subject to an MMS-
approved unit agreement, the lessees of other leases in the unit may not 
apply any portion of the royalty suspension supplement for your lease to 
production from the other leases in the unit.
    (f) You must begin or resume paying royalties when cumulative gas 
and oil production from, or allocated under an MMS-approved unit 
agreement to, your lease (excluding any gas produced from qualified 
wells subject to a royalty suspension volume allowed under Sec. 203.41) 
reaches the applicable royalty suspension supplement. For the month in 
which the cumulative production reaches this royalty suspension 
supplement, you owe royalties on the portion of gas or oil production 
that exceeds the amount of the royalty suspension supplement remaining 
at the beginning of that month.


<R05>
Sec. 203.46  What administrative steps do I take to obtain and use the 
royalty suspension supplement?

    (a) Before you start drilling a well on your lease targeted to a 
reservoir at least 18,000 feet TVD SS, you must notify, in writing, the 
MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and Development of your intent to 
begin drilling operations and the depth of the target.

[[Page 27]]

    (b) After drilling the well, you must provide the MMS Regional 
Supervisor for Production and Development within 60 days after reaching 
the total depth in your well:
    (1) Information that allows MMS to confirm that you drilled a 
certified unsuccessful well as defined under Sec. 203.0, including:
    (i) Well log data, if your original well or sidetrack does not meet 
the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 250, subpart A; or
    (ii) Well log, well test, seismic, and economic data, if your well 
does meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 250, subpart A; 
and
    (2) Information that allows MMS to confirm the size of the royalty 
suspension supplement for a sidetrack, including sidetrack measured 
depth and supporting documentation.
    (c) If you commenced drilling a well that otherwise meets the 
criteria for a certified unsuccessful well on or after March 26, 2003, 
and finished it before May 3, 2004, provide the information in paragraph 
(b) of this section no later than August 3, 2004.

<R05>
Sec. 203.47  Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?

    (a) You must pay royalties on all gas and oil production for which 
royalty suspension volume or royalty suspension supplement otherwise 
would be allowed under Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.46 for any calendar 
year when the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds the 
threshold of $9.34 per MMBtu, adjusted annually after year 2004 for 
inflation. The threshold price for any calendar year after 2004 is found 
by adjusting the threshold price in the previous year by the percentage 
that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product as 
published by the Department of Commerce changed during the calendar 
year.
    (b) You must pay any royalty due under this paragraph, plus late 
payment interest from the end of the month after the month of production 
until the date of payment under 30 CFR 218.54, no later than 90 days 
after the end of the calendar year for which you owe royalty.
    (c) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this 
section count as part of your royalty suspension volumes and royalty 
suspension supplements.

Sec. 203.48  May I substitute the deep gas drilling provisions in Sec.  
203.0 and Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.47 for the deep gas royalty 
relief provided in my lease terms?

    (a) You may exercise an option to replace the applicable lease terms 
for royalty relief related to deep-well drilling with those in Sec. 
203.0 and Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.47 if you have a lease issued 
with royalty relief provisions for deep-well drilling. Such leases:
    (1) Must be issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after January 
1, 2001, and before April 1, 2004; and
    (2) Must be located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West 
longitude in the GOM entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters 
deep.
    (b) To exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this section, you 
must notify, in writing, the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and 
Development of your decision before September 1, 2004 or 180 days after 
your lease is issued, whichever is later, and specify the lease and 
block number.
    (c) Once you exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this 
section, you are subject to all the activity, timing, and administrative 
requirements pertaining to deep gas royalty relief as specified in 
Sec. Sec. 203.40 through 203.47.
    (d) Exercising the option under paragraph (a) of this section is 
irrevocable. If you do not exercise this option, then the terms of your 
lease apply.

                  Royalty Relief for End-of-life Leases


<R05>
Sec. 203.50  Who may apply for end-of-life royalty relief?

    You may apply for royalty relief in two situations.
    (a) Your end-of-life lease (as defined in Sec. 203.2) is an oil and 
gas lease and has average daily production of at least 100 barrels of 
oil equivalent (BOE) per month (as calculated in Sec. 203.73) in at 
least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are 
considered the qualifying months. These 12

[[Page 28]]

months should reflect the basic operation you intend to use until your 
resources are depleted. If you changed your operation significantly 
(e.g., begin re-injecting rather than recovering gas) during the 
qualifying months, or if you do so while we are processing your 
application, we may defer action on your application until you revise it 
to show the new circumstances.
    (b) Your end-of-life lease is other than an oil and gas lease (e.g., 
sulphur) and has production in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The 
most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998, as amended at 63 FR 57249, Oct. 27, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 203.51  How do I apply for end-of-life royalty relief?

    You must submit a complete application and the required fee to the 
appropriate MMS Regional Director. Your MMS regional office will provide 
specific guidance on the report formats. A complete application for 
relief includes:
    (a) An administrative information report (specified in Sec. 203.83) 
and
    (b) A net revenue and relief justification report (specified in 
Sec. 203.84).


<R05>
Sec. 203.52  What criteria must I meet to get relief?

    (a) To qualify for relief, you must demonstrate that the sum of 
royalty payments over the 12 qualifying months exceeds 75 percent of the 
sum of net revenues (before-royalty revenues minus allowable costs, as 
defined in Sec. 203.84).
    (b) To re-qualify for relief, e.g., either applying for additional 
relief on top of relief already granted, or applying for relief sometime 
after your earlier agreement terminated, you must demonstrate that:
    (1) You have met the criterion listed in paragraph (a) of this 
section, and
    (2) The 12 required qualifying months of operation have occurred 
under the current royalty arrangement.


<R05>
Sec. 203.53  What relief will MMS grant?

    (a) If we approve your application and you meet certain conditions, 
we will reduce the pre-application effective royalty rate by one-half on 
production up to the relief volume amount. If you produce more than the 
relief volume amount:
    (1) We will impose a royalty rate equal to 1.5 times the effective 
royalty rate on your additional production up to twice the relief volume 
amount; and
    (2) We will impose a royalty rate equal to the effective rate on all 
production greater than twice the relief volume amount.
    (b) Regardless of the level of production or prices (see Sec. 
203.54), royalty payments due under end-of-life relief will not exceed 
the royalty obligations that would have been due at the effective 
royalty rate.
    (1) The effective royalty rate is the average lease rate paid on 
production during the 12 qualifying months.
    (2) The relief volume amount is the average monthly BOE production 
for the 12 qualifying months.


<R05>
Sec. 203.54  How does my relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease 
operate if prices rise sharply?

    In those months when your current reference price rises by at least 
25 percent above your base reference price, you must pay the effective 
royalty rate on all monthly production.
    (a) Your current reference price is a weighted average of daily 
closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas 
over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
    (b) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing 
prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas during the 
qualifying months; and
    (c) Your weighting factors are the proportions of your total 
production volume (in BOE) provided by oil and gas during the qualifying 
months.


<R05>
Sec. 203.55  Under what conditions can my end-of-life royalty relief 
arrangement for an oil and gas lease be ended?

    (a) If you have an end-of-life royalty relief arrangement, you may 
renounce it at any time. The lease rate will return to the effective 
rate during the qualifying period in the first full month following our 
receipt of your renouncement of the relief arrangement.

[[Page 29]]

    (b) If you pay the effective lease rate for 12 consecutive months, 
we will terminate your relief. The lease rate will return to the 
effective rate in the first full month following this termination.
    (c) We may stipulate in the letter of approval for individual cases 
certain events that would cause us to terminate relief because they are 
inconsistent with an end-of-life situation.


<R05>
Sec. 203.56  Does relief transfer when a lease is assigned?

    Yes. Royalty relief is based on the lease circumstances, not 
ownership. It transfers upon lease assignment.

Royalty Relief For Deep Water Expansion Projects And Pre-Act Deep Water 
                                 Leases


<R05>
Sec. 203.60  Who may apply for deep water royalty relief?

    You may apply for royalty relief under Sec. Sec. 203.61(b) and 
203.62 if:
    (a) You are a lessee of a lease in water at least 200 meters deep in 
the GOM and lying wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude;
    (b) We have assigned your pre-Act lease to a field (as defined in 
Sec. 203.0); and
    (c) You either:
    (1) Hold a pre-Act lease on an authorized field (as defined in Sec. 
203.0) or
    (2) Propose an expansion project (as defined in Sec. 203.0) or
    (3) Propose a development project (as defined in Sec. 203.0).

[67 FR 1875, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.61  How do I assess my chances for getting relief?

    You may ask for a nonbinding assessment (a formal opinion on whether 
a field would qualify for royalty relief) before turning in your first 
complete application on an authorized field. This field must have a 
qualifying well under 30 CFR part 250, subpart A, or be on a lease that 
has allocated production under an approved unit agreement.
    (a) To request a nonbinding assessment, you must:
    (1) Submit a draft application in the format and detail specified in 
guidance from the MMS regional office for the GOM;
    (2) Propose to drill at least one more appraisal well if you get a 
favorable assessment; and
    (3) Pay a fee under Sec. 203.3.
    (b) You must wait at least 90 days after receiving our assessment to 
apply for relief under Sec. 203.62.
    (c) This assessment is not binding because a complete application 
may contain more accurate information that does not support our original 
assessment. It will help you decide whether your proposed inputs for 
evaluating economic viability and your supporting data and assumptions 
are adequate.

    Effective Date Note: At 63 FR 2619, Jan. 16, 1998, Sec. 203.61 was 
revised. This section contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given 
by the Office of Management and Budget.


<R05>
Sec. 203.62  How do I apply for relief?

    You must send a complete application and the required fee to the MMS 
Regional Director for the GOM.
    (a) Your application for deep water royalty relief must include an 
original and two copies (one set of digital information) of:
    (1) Administrative information report;
    (2) Deep water economic viability and relief justification report;
    (3) G&G report;
    (4) Engineering report;
    (5) Production report; and
    (6) Deep water cost report.
    (b) Section 203.82 explains why we are authorized to require these 
reports.
    (c) Sections 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89 describe what 
these reports must include. The MMS regional office for the GOM will 
guide you on the format for the required reports, and we encourage you 
to contact this office prior to preparing your application for this 
guidance.

<R05>
Sec. 203.63  Does my application have to include all leases in the field?

    (a) For authorized fields, we will accept only one joint application 
for all leases that are part of the designated field on the date of 
application, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and 
Sec. 203.64. However, we will

[[Page 30]]

evaluate all acreage that may eventually become part of the authorized 
field. Therefore, if you have any other leases that you believe may 
eventually be part of the authorized field, you must submit data for 
these leases according to Sec. 203.81.
    (1) The Regional Director maintains a Field Names Master List with 
updates of all leases in each designated field.
    (2) To avoid sharing proprietary data with other lessees on the 
field, you may submit your proprietary G&G report separately from the 
rest of your application. Your application is not complete until we 
receive all the required information for each lease on the field. We 
will not disclose proprietary data when explaining our assumptions and 
reasons for our determinations under Sec. 203.67.
    (3) We will not require a joint application if you show good cause 
and honest effort to get all lessees in the field to participate. If you 
must exclude a lease from your application because its lessee will not 
participate, that lease is ineligible for the royalty relief for the 
designated field.
    (b) If your application seeks only relief for a development project 
or an expansion project, your application does not have to include all 
leases in the field.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 1875, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.64  How many applications may I file on a field or a 
development project?

    You may file one complete application for royalty relief during the 
life of the field or for a development project or an expansion project 
designed to produce a reservoir or set of reservoirs. However, you may 
send another application if:
    (a) You are eligible to apply for a redetermination under Sec. 
203.74;
    (b) You apply for royalty relief for an expansion project;
    (c) You withdraw the application before we make a determination; or
    (d) You apply for end-of-life royalty relief.

<R05>
Sec. 203.65  How long will MMS take to evaluate my application?

    (a) We will determine within 20 working days if your application for 
royalty relief is complete. If your application is incomplete, we will 
explain in writing what it needs. If you withdraw a complete 
application, you may reapply.
    (b) We will evaluate your first application on a field within 180 
days, evaluate your first application on a development project or an 
expansion project within 150 days and evaluate a redetermination under 
Sec. 203.75 within 120 days after we determine that it is complete.
    (c) We may ask to extend the review period for your application 
under the conditions in the following table.

Sec. 203.67  What economic criteria must I meet to get royalty relief on 
an authorized field or project?

    We will not approve applications if we determine that royalty relief 
cannot make the field, development project, or expansion project 
economically viable. Your field or project must be uneconomic while you 
are paying royalties and must become economic with royalty relief.

Sec. 203.69  If my application is approved, what royalty relief will I 
receive?

    If we approve your application, subject to certain conditions, we 
will not collect royalties on a specified suspension volume for your 
field, development project, or expansion project. Suspension volumes 
include volumes allocated to a lease under an approved unit agreement, 
but exclude any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-
bearing under the lease or the regulations of this chapter (e.g., fuel 
gas).
    (a) For authorized fields, the minimum royalty-suspension volumes 
are:
    (1) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) for fields in 200 
to 400 meters of water;
    (2) 52.5 MMBOE for fields in 400 to 800 meters of water; and

[[Page 32]]

    (3) 87.5 MMBOE for fields in more than 800 meters of water.
    (b) For development projects, any relief we grant applies only to 
project wells and replaces the royalty suspension volume with which we 
issued your lease. If your project is economic given the royalty 
suspension volume with which we issued your lease, we will reject the 
application. Otherwise, the minimum royalty suspension volumes are as 
shown in the following table:

    (c) If your application includes pre-Act or eligible leases in 
different categories of water depth, we apply the minimum royalty 
suspension volume for the deepest such lease then assigned to the field. 
We base the water depth and makeup of a field on the water-depth 
delineations in the ``Lease Terms and Economic Conditions'' map and the 
``Field Names Master List'' documents and updates in effect at the time 
your application is deemed complete. These publications are available 
from the MMS Regional Office for the GOM.
    (d) You will get a royalty suspension volume above the minimum if we 
determine that you need more to make the field or development project 
economic.
    (e) For expansion projects, the minimum royalty suspension volume 
equals 10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable 
resources upon which we based approval of your application from all 
reservoirs included in your project plus any suspension volumes required 
under Sec. 203.66. If we determine that your expansion project may be 
economic only with more relief, we will determine and grant you the 
royalty suspension volume necessary to make the project economic.
    (f) The royalty suspension volume applicable to specific leases will 
continue through the end of the month in which cumulative production 
reaches that volume. You must calculate cumulative production from all 
the leases in the authorized field or project that are entitled to share 
the royalty suspension volume.

Sec. 203.71  How does MMS allocate a field's suspension volume between 
my lease and other leases on my field?

    The allocation depends on when production occurs, when we issued the 
lease, when we assigned it to the field, and whether we award the volume 
suspension by an approved application or establish it in the lease 
terms, as prescribed in this section.
    (a) If your authorized field has an approved royalty suspension 
volume under Sec. Sec. 203.67 and 203.69, we will suspend payment of 
royalties on production from all leases in the field that participate in 
the application until their cumulative production equals the approved 
volume. The following conditions also apply:

    (c) When a project has more than one lease, the royalty suspension 
volume for each lease equals that lease's actual production from the 
project (or production allocated under an approved unit agreement) until 
total production for all leases in the project equals the project's 
approved royalty suspension volume.
    (d) You may receive a royalty-suspension volume only if your entire 
lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. If the field 
lies on both sides of this meridian, only leases located entirely west 
of the meridian will receive a royalty-suspension volume.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 1877, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.72  Can my lease receive more than one suspension volume?

    Yes. You may apply for royalty relief that involves more than one 
suspension volume under Sec. 203.62 in two circumstances.
    (a) Each field that includes your lease may receive a separate 
royalty-suspension volume, if it meets the evaluation criteria of Sec. 
203.67.
    (b) An expansion project on your lease may receive a separate 
royalty-suspension volume, even if we have already granted a royalty-
suspension volume to the field that encompasses the project. But the 
reserves associated with the project must not have been part of our 
original determination, and the project must meet the evaluation 
criteria of Sec. 203.67.


<R05>
Sec. 203.73  How do suspension volumes apply to natural gas?

    You must measure natural gas production under the royalty-suspension 
volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured in 
accordance with 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil 
equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 203.74  When will MMS reconsider its determination?

    You may request a redetermination after we withdraw approval or 
after you renounce royalty relief, unless we withdraw approval due to 
your providing false or intentionally inaccurate information. Under 
certain conditions you may also request a redetermination if we deny 
your application or if you want your approved royalty suspension volume 
to change. In these instances, to be eligible for a redetermination, at 
least one of the following four conditions must occur.
    (a) You have significant new G&G data and you previously have not 
either requested a redetermination or reapplied for relief after we 
withdrew approval or you relinquished royalty relief. ``Significant'' 
means that the new G&G data:
    (1) Results from drilling new wells or getting new three-dimensional 
seismic data and information (but not reinterpreting old data);
    (2) Did not exist at the time of the earlier application; and
    (3) Changes your estimates of gross resource size, quality, or 
projected flow rates enough to materially affect the results of our 
earlier determination.
    (b) You demonstrate in your new application that the technology that

[[Page 35]]

most efficiently develops this field or lease was not considered or 
deemed feasible in the original application. Your newly proposed 
technology must improve the profitability, under equivalent market 
conditions, of the field or lease relative to the development system 
proposed in the prior application.
    (c) Your current reference price decreases by more than 25 percent 
from your base reference price as calculated under this paragraph.
    (1) Your current reference price is a weighted-average of daily 
closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas 
over the most recent full 12 calendar months;
    (2) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing 
prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas for the 
full 12 calendar months preceding the date of your most recently 
approved application for this royalty relief; and
    (3) The weighting factors are the proportions of the total 
production volume (in BOE) for oil and gas associated with the most 
likely scenario (identified in Sec. Sec. 203.85 and 203.88) from your 
most recently approved application for this royalty relief.
    (d) Before starting to build your development and production system, 
you have revised your estimated development costs, and they are more 
than 120 percent of the eligible development costs associated with the 
most likely scenario from your most recently approved application for 
this royalty relief.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998; 63 FR 24747, May 5, 1998, as amended at 67 
FR 1878, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.75  What risk do I run if I request a redetermination?

    If you request a redetermination after we have granted you a 
suspension volume, you could lose some or all of the previously granted 
relief. This can happen because you must file a new complete application 
and pay the required fee, as discussed in Sec. 203.62. We will evaluate 
your application under Sec. 203.67 using the conditions prevailing at 
the time of your redetermination request. In our evaluation, we may find 
that you should receive a larger, equivalent, smaller, or no suspension 
volume. This means we could find that you do not qualify for the amount 
of relief previously granted or for any relief at all.


<R05>
Sec. 203.76  When might MMS withdraw or reduce the approved size of my 
relief?

    We will withdraw approval of relief for any of the following 
reasons.
    (a) You change the type of development system proposed in your 
application (e.g., change from a fixed platform to floating production 
system, or from an independent development and production system to one 
with subsea wells tied back to a host production facility, etc.).
    (b) You do not start building the proposed development and 
production system within18 months of the date we approved your 
application, unless the MMS Director grants you an extension under Sec. 
203.79(c). If you start building the proposed system and then suspend 
its construction before completion, and you do not restart continuous 
building of the proposed system within 18 months of our approval, we 
will withdraw the relief we granted.
    (c) Your actual development costs are less than 80 percent of the 
eligible development costs estimated in your application's most likely 
scenario, and you do not report that fact in your post-production 
development report (Sec. 203.70). Development costs are those 
expenditures defined in Sec. 203.89(b) incurred between the application 
submission date and start of production. If you report this fact in the 
post-production development report, you may retain the lesser of 50 
percent of the original royalty suspension volume or 50 percent of the 
median of the distribution of the potentially recoverable resources 
anticipated in your application.
    (d) We granted you a royalty-suspension volume after you qualified 
for a redetermination under Sec. 203.74(c), and we find out your actual 
development costs are less than 90 percent of the eligible development 
costs associated with your application's most likely scenario. 
Development costs are those expenditures defined in Sec. 203.89(b) 
incurred between your application submission date and start of 
production.

[[Page 36]]

    (e) You do not send us the fabrication confirmation report or the 
post-production development report, or you provide false or 
intentionally inaccurate information that was material to our granting 
royalty relief under this section. You must pay royalties and late-
payment interest determined under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and Sec. 218.54 of 
this chapter on all volumes for which you used the royalty suspension. 
You also may be subject to penalties under other provisions of law.

[63 FR 2618, Jan. 16, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 1878, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.77  May I voluntarily give up relief if conditions change?

    Yes, by sending a letter to that effect to the MMS Regional Director 
for the GOM.

[67 FR 1878, Jan. 15, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 203.78  Do I keep relief if prices rise significantly?

    If prices rise above a base price for light sweet crude oil or 
natural gas, set by statute for pre-Act leases, indicated in your 
original lease agreement or Notice of Sale for post-November 2000 deep 
water leases, you must pay full royalties as prescribed in this section. 
For post-November 2000 deepwater leases, price thresholds apply on a 
lease basis, so different leases on the same field, development project, 
or expansion project may have different price thresholds.
    (a) Suppose the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX light 
sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $28.00 per 
barrel, as adjusted in paragraph (f) of this section. In this case, we 
retract the royalty relief authorized in this section and you must:
    (1) Pay royalties on all oil production for the previous year at the 
lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 
Sec. 218.54 of this chapter) by March 31 of the current calendar year, 
and
    (2) Pay royalties on all your oil production in the current year.
    (b) Suppose the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX 
natural gas prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $3.50 per 
million British thermal units (Btu), as adjusted in paragraph (f) of 
this section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in 
this section and you must:
    (1) Pay royalties on all natural gas production for the previous 
year at the lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 
1721 and Sec. 218.54 of this chapter) by March 31 of the current 
calendar year, and
    (2) Pay royalties on all your natural gas production in the current 
year.
    (c) Production under both paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume.
    (d) You are entitled to a refund or credit, with interest, of 
royalties paid on any production (that counts as part of the royalty-
suspension volume):
    (1) Of oil if the arithmetic average of the closing oil prices for 
the current calendar year is $28.00 per barrel or less, as adjusted in 
paragraph (f) of this section, and
    (2) Of gas if the arithmetic average of the closing natural gas 
prices for the current calendar year is $3.50 per million Btu or less, 
as adjusted in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) You must follow our regulations in part 230 of this chapter for 
receiving refunds or credits.
    (f) We change the prices referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) 
of this section periodically. For pre-Act leases, these prices change 
during each calendar year after 1994 by the percentage that the implicit 
price deflator for the gross domestic product changed during the 
preceding calendar year. For post-November 2000 deepwater leases, these 
prices change as indicated in the lease instrument or in the Notice of 
Sale under which we issued the lease.

<R05>
Sec. 203.79  How do I appeal MMS's decisions related to Deep Water 
Royalty Relief?

    (a) Once we have designated your lease as part of a field and 
notified you and other affected operators of the designation, you can 
request reconsideration by sending the MMS Director a letter within 15 
days that also states your reasons. The MMS Director's response is the 
final agency action.

[[Page 37]]

    (b) Our decisions on your application for relief from paying royalty 
under Sec. 203.67 and the royalty-suspension volumes under Sec.  203.69 
are final agency actions.
    (c) If you cannot start construction by the deadline in Sec. 
203.76(b) for reasons beyond your control (e.g., strike at the 
fabrication yard), you may request an extension up to 1 year by writing 
the MMS Director and stating your reasons. The MMS Director's response 
is the final agency action.
    (d) We will notify you of all final agency actions by certified 
mail, return receipt requested. Final agency actions are not subject to 
appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 290 and 
43 CFR part 4. They are judicially reviewable under section 10(a) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 702) only if you file an action 
within 30 days of the date you receive our decision.


<R05>
Sec. 203.80  When can I get royalty relief if I am not eligible for 
end-of-life or deep water royalty relief?

    We may grant royalty relief when it serves the statutory purposes 
summarized in Sec. 203.1, and our formal relief programs provide 
inadequate encouragement to increase production or development. Unless 
your lease lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in 
the Gulf of Mexico, your lease must be producing to qualify for relief. 
Before you may apply for royalty relief apart from our end-of-life or 
deepwater programs, we must agree that your lease or project has two or 
more of the following characteristics:
    (a) The lease has produced for a substantial period and the lessee 
can recover significant additional resources. Significant additional 
resources means enough to allow production for at least a year more than 
would be profitable without royalty relief.
    (b) Valuable facilities (e.g., a platform or pipeline that would be 
removed upon lease relinquishment) exist that we do not expect a 
successor lessee to use. If the facilities are located off the lease, 
their preservation must depend on continued production from the lease 
applying for royalty relief. We will only consider an allocable share of 
costs for off-lease facilities in the relief application.
    (c) A substantial risk exists that no new lessee will recover the 
resources.
    (d) The lessee made major efforts to reduce operating costs too 
recently to use the formal program for royalty relief (e.g., recent 
significant change in operations).
    (e) Circumstances beyond the lessee's control, other than water 
depth, preclude reliance on one of the existing royalty relief programs.

Sec. 203.82  What is MMS's authority to collect this information?

    The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information 
collection requirements in part 203 under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and 
assigned OMB control number 1010-0071.
    (a) We use the information to determine whether royalty relief will 
result in production that wouldn't otherwise occur. We rely largely on 
your information to make these determinations.
    (1) Your application for royalty relief must contain enough 
information on finances, economics, reservoirs, G&G characteristics, 
production, and engineering estimates for us to determine whether:
    (i) We should grant relief under the law, and
    (ii) The requested relief will ultimately recover more resources and 
return a reasonable profit on project investments.
    (2) Your fabricator confirmation and post-production development 
reports must contain enough information for us to verify that your 
application reasonably represented your plans.
    (b) Applicants (respondents) are Federal OCS oil and gas lessees. 
Applications are required to obtain or retain a benefit. Therefore, if 
you apply for royalty relief, you must provide this information. We will 
protect information considered proprietary under applicable law and 
under regulations at Sec. 203.63(b) and part 250 of this chapter.
    (c) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires us to inform you 
that we may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond 
to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number.
    (d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of 
information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Minerals 
Management Service, Mail Stop 4230, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20240.

Sec. 203.83  What is in an administrative information report?

    This report identifies the field or lease for which royalty relief 
is requested and must contain the following items:
    (a) The field or lease name;
    (b) The serial number of leases we have assigned to the field, names 
of the lease title holders of record, the lease operators, and whether 
any lease is part of a unit;
    (c) Well number, API number, location, and status of each well that 
has been drilled on the field or lease or project (not required for non-
oil and gas leases);
    (d) The location of any new wells proposed under the terms of the 
application (not required for non-oil and gas leases);
    (e) A description of field or lease history;
    (f) Full information as to whether you will pay royalties or a share 
of production to anyone other than the United States, the amount you 
will pay, and how much you will reduce this payment if we grant relief;
    (g) The type of royalty relief you are requesting;
    (h) Confirmation that we approved a DOCD or supplemental DOCD (Deep

[[Page 39]]

Water expansion project applications only); and
    (i) A narrative description of the development activities associated 
with the proposed capital investments and an explanation of proposed 
timing of the activities and the effect on production (Deep Water 
applications only).

Sec. 203.84  What is in a net revenue and relief justification report?

    This report presents cash flow data for 12 qualifying months, using 
the format specified in the ``Guidelines for the Application, Review, 
Approval, and Administration of Royalty Relief for End-of-Life Leases'', 
U.S. Department of the Interior, MMS. Qualifying months for an oil and 
gas lease are the most recent 12 months out of the last 15 months that 
you produced at least 100 BOE per day on average. Qualifying months for 
other than oil and gas leases are the most recent 12 of the last 15 
months having some production.
    (a) The cash flow table you submit must include historical data for:
    (1) Lease production subject to royalty;
    (2) Total revenues;
    (3) Royalty payments out of production;
    (4) Total allowable costs; and
    (5) Transportation and processing costs.
    (b) Do not include in your cash flow table the non-allowable costs 
listed at 30 CFR 220.013 or:
    (1) OCS rental payments on the lease(s) in the application;
    (2) Damages and losses;
    (3) Taxes;
    (4) Any costs associated with exploratory activities;
    (5) Civil or criminal fines or penalties;
    (6) Fees for your royalty relief application; and
    (7) Costs associated with existing obligations (e.g., royalty 
overrides or other forms of payment for acquiring the lease, 
depreciation on previously acquired equipment or facilities).
    (c) We may, in reviewing and evaluating your application, disallow 
costs when you have not shown they are necessary to operate the lease, 
or if they are inconsistent with end-of-life operations.

Sec. 203.85  What is in an economic viability and relief justification 
report?

    This report should show that your project appears economic without 
royalties and sunk costs using the RSVP model we provide. The format of 
the report and the assumptions and parameters we specify are found in 
the ``Guidelines for the Application, Review, Approval and 
Administration of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Program,'' U.S. 
Department of the Interior, MMS. Clearly justify each parameter you set 
in every scenario you specify in the RSVP. You may provide supplemental 
information, including your own model and results. The economic 
viability and relief justification report must contain the following 
items for an oil and gas lease.

(Sec. Sec. 203.86 through 203.89) and

[[Page 40]]

    (2) The development and production scenarios provided in the various 
reports are consistent with each other and with the proposed development 
system. You can use up to three scenarios (conservative, most likely, 
and optimistic), but you must link each to a specific range on the 
distribution of resources from the RSVP Resource Module.

will be associated with the conservative development and production 
scenario; the middle range will be related to the most likely 
development and production scenario; and, the high end range will be 
consistent with the optimistic development and production scenario.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 204.1  What is the purpose of this part?

    This part explains how you as a lessee or designee of a Federal 
onshore or Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas lease may obtain 
prepayment or accounting and auditing relief for production from certain 
marginal properties. This part does not apply to production from Indian 
leases, even if the Indian lease is within an agreement that qualifies 
as a marginal property.

[[Page 44]]


<R05>
Sec. 204.2  What definitions apply to this part?

    Agreement means a federally approved communitization agreement or 
unit participating area.
    Barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) means the combined equivalent 
production of oil and gas stated in barrels of oil. Each barrel of oil 
production is equal to one BOE. Also, each 6,000 cubic feet of gas 
production is equal to one BOE.
    Base period means the 12-month period from July 1 through June 30 
immediately preceding the calendar year for which you take or request 
marginal property relief. For example, if you request relief for 
calendar year 2006, your base period is July 1, 2004, through June 30, 
2005.
    Combined equivalent production means the total of all oil and gas 
production for the marginal property, stated in BOE.
    Designee means the person designated by a lessee under 30 CFR 218.52 
to make all or part of the royalty or other payments due on a lease on 
the lessee's behalf.
    Producing wells means only those producing oil or gas wells that 
contribute to the sum of BOE used in the calculation under Sec. 
204.4(c). Producing wells do not include injection or water wells. Wells 
with multiple zones commingled downhole are considered as a single well.
    Property means a lease, a portion of a lease, or an agreement that 
may be a marginal property if it meets the qualification requirements of 
Sec. 204.4.
    State concerned (State) means the State that receives a statutorily 
prescribed portion of the royalties from a Federal onshore or OCS lease.


<R05>
Sec. 204.3  What alternatives are available for marginal properties?

    If you have production from a marginal property, MMS and the State 
may allow you the following options:
    (a) Prepay royalty. MMS and the State may allow you to make a lump-
sum advance payment of royalties instead of monthly royalty payments for 
the remainder of the lease term. See Subpart B for prepayment of royalty 
requirements.
    (b) Take accounting and auditing relief. MMS and the State may allow 
various accounting and auditing relief options to encourage you to 
continue to produce and develop your marginal property. See Subpart C 
for accounting and auditing relief requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 204.4  What is a marginal property under this part?

    (a) To qualify as a marginal property eligible for royalty 
prepayment or accounting and auditing relief under this part, the 
property must meet the following requirements:

combined equivalent production of the property during the base period 
must equal an average daily well production of less than 15 barrels of 
oil equivalent (BOE) per well per day calculated under paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    (c) To determine the average daily well production for a property, 
divide the sum of the BOE for all producing wells on the property during 
the base period by the sum of the number of days that each of those 
wells actually produced during the base period. If the property is an 
agreement, your calculation under this paragraph must include all wells 
included in the agreement, even if they are not on a Federal onshore or 
OCS lease.


<R05>
Sec. 204.5  What statutory requirements must I meet to obtain royalty 
prepayment or accounting and auditing relief?

    (a) MMS and the State may allow royalty prepayment or accounting and 
auditing relief for your marginal property production if MMS and the 
State jointly determine that the prepayment or accounting and auditing 
relief is in the best interests of the Federal Government and the State 
to:
    (1) Promote production;
    (2) Reduce the administrative costs of MMS and the State; and
    (3) Increase net receipts to the Federal Government and the State.
    (b) At any time, if MMS and the State determine that either 
prepayment or accounting and auditing relief no longer meets the 
criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, MMS, with the State's 
concurrence, may discontinue any prepayment or accounting and auditing 
relief options granted for production from any marginal property.
    (1) MMS will provide you written notice of the decision to 
discontinue relief.
    (i) If you took the cumulative reports and payments relief option 
under Sec. 204.202, your relief will terminate at the end of the 
calendar year in which you received the notice.
    (ii) If you were approved for prepayment relief under subpart B of 
this part or other relief under Sec. 204.203, MMS's notice will tell 
you when your relief terminates.
    (2) MMS's decision to discontinue relief is not subject to 
administrative appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 204.6  May I appeal if MMS denies my request for prepayment or 
other relief?

    If MMS denies your request for prepayment relief under Subpart B of 
this part or other relief under Sec. 204.203, you may appeal under 30 
CFR part 290.

Subpart B--Prepayment of Royalty [Reserved]


<R04>
                Subpart C_Accounting and Auditing Relief


<R05>
Sec. 204.200  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart explains how you as a lessee or designee may obtain 
accounting and auditing relief for your Federal onshore or OCS lease 
production from a marginal property. The two types of accounting and 
auditing relief that you can receive under this subpart are cumulative 
reports and payment relief (explained in Sec. 204.202) and other 
accounting and auditing relief appropriate for your property (explained 
in Sec. 204.203).


<R05>
Sec. 204.201  Who may obtain accounting and auditing relief?

    (a) You may obtain accounting and auditing relief under this 
subpart:
    (1) If you are a lessee or a designee for a Federal lease with 
production from a property that qualifies as a marginal property under 
Sec. 204.4;
    (2) If you meet any additional requirements for specific types of 
relief under this subpart; and
    (3) Only for the fractional interest in production from the marginal 
property for which you report and pay royalty. You may obtain relief 
even if the other lessees or designees for your lease or agreement do 
not request relief.
    (b) You may not obtain one or both of the relief options specified 
in this subpart on any portion of production from a marginal property 
if:
    (1) The marginal property covers multiple States; and

[[Page 46]]

    (2) One of the States determines under Sec. 204.208 that it will 
not allow the relief option you seek.


<R05>
Sec. 204.202  What is the cumulative royalty reports and payments relief 
option?

    (a) The cumulative royalty reports and payments relief option allows 
you to submit one royalty report and payment annually for production 
during a calendar year. You are eligible for this option only if the 
total volume produced from the marginal property (not just your share of 
the production) is 1,000 BOE or less during the base period.
    (b) To use the cumulative royalty reports and payments relief 
option, you must do all of the following:
    (1) Notify MMS in writing by January 31 of the calendar year for 
which you begin taking your relief. See Sec. 204.205(a) for what your 
notification must contain;
    (2) Submit your royalty report and payment in accordance with 30 CFR 
218.51(g) by the end of February of the year following the calendar year 
for which you reported annually, unless you have an estimated payment on 
file. If you have an estimated payment on file, you must submit your 
royalty report and payment by the end of March of the year following the 
calendar year for which you reported annually;
    (3) Use the sales month prior to the month that you submit your 
annual report and payment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section on your 
Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance, Form MMS-2014, for the entire 
previous calendar year's production for which you are paying annually. 
(For example, for a report in February use January as your sales month, 
and for a report in March use February as your sales month, to report 
production for the entire previous calendar year for which you are 
paying annually);
    (4) Report one line of cumulative royalty information on Form MMS-
2014 for the calendar year, the same as if it were a monthly report; and
    (5) Report allowances on Form MMS-2014 on the same annual basis as 
the royalties for your marginal property production.
    (c) If you do not pay your royalty by the date due in paragraph (b) 
of this section, you will owe late payment interest determined under 30 
CFR 218.54 from the date your payment was due under this section until 
the date MMS receives it.
    (d) If you take relief you are not qualified for, you may be liable 
for civil penalties. Also you must:
    (1) Pay MMS late payment interest determined under 30 CFR 218.54 
from the date your payment was due until the date MMS receives it; and
    (2) Amend your Form MMS-2014 to reflect the required monthly 
reporting.
    (e) If you dispose of your ownership interest in a marginal property 
for which you have taken relief under this section (or if you are a 
designee who reports and pays royalty for a lessee who has disposed of 
its ownership interest), you must:
    (1) Report and pay royalties for the portion of the calendar year 
for which you had an ownership interest; and
    (2) Make the report and payment by the end of the month after you 
dispose of the ownership interest in the marginal property. If you do 
not report and pay timely, you will owe interest determined under 30 CFR 
218.54 from the date the payment was due under this section.


<R05>
Sec. 204.203  What is the other relief option?

    (a) Under this relief option, you may request any type of accounting 
and auditing relief that is appropriate for production from your 
marginal property, provided it is not prohibited under Sec. 204.204 and 
meets the statutory requirements of Sec. 204.5. Examples of relief 
options you could request are:
    (1) To report and pay royalties using a valuation method other than 
that required under 30 CFR part 206 that approximates royalties payable 
under that part 206; and
    (2) To reduce your royalty audit burden. However, MMS will not 
consider any request that eliminates MMS's or the States' right to 
audit.
    (b) You must request approval from MMS under Sec. 204.205(b), and 
receive approval under Sec. 204.206 before taking relief under this 
option.

[[Page 47]]


<R05>
Sec. 204.204  What accounting and auditing relief will MMS not allow?

    MMS will not approve your request for accounting and auditing relief 
under this subpart if your request:
    (a) Prohibits MMS or the State from conducting any form of audit;
    (b) Permanently relieves you from making future royalty reports or 
payments;
    (c) Provides for less frequent royalty reports and payments than 
annually;
    (d) Provides for you to submit royalty reports and payments at 
separate times;
    (e) Impairs MMS's ability to properly or efficiently account for or 
distribute royalties;
    (f) Requests relief for a lease under which the Federal Government 
takes its royalties in kind;
    (g) Alters production reporting requirements;
    (h) Alters lease operation or safety requirements;
    (i) Conflicts with rent, minimum royalty, or lease requirements; or
    (j) Requests relief for production from a marginal property located 
in whole or in part in a State that has determined that it will not 
allow such relief under Sec. 204.208.


<R05>
Sec. 204.205  How do I obtain accounting and auditing relief?

    (a) To take cumulative reports and payments relief under Sec. 
204.202, you must notify MMS in writing by January 31 of the calendar 
year for which you begin taking your relief.
    (1) Your notification must contain:
    (i) Your company name, MMS-assigned payor code, address, phone 
number, and contact name; and
    (ii) The specific MMS lease number and agreement number, if 
applicable.
    (2) You may file a single notification for multiple marginal 
properties.
    (b) To obtain other relief under Sec. 204.203, you must file a 
written request for relief with MMS.
    (1) Your request must contain:
    (i) Your company name, MMS-assigned payor code, address, phone 
number, and contact name;
    (ii) The MMS lease number and agreement number, if applicable; and
    (iii) A complete and detailed description of the specific accounting 
or auditing relief you seek.
    (2) You may file a single request for multiple marginal properties 
if you are requesting the same relief for all properties.


<R05>
Sec. 204.206  What will MMS do when it receives my request for other 
relief?

    When MMS receives your request for other relief under Sec. 
204.205(b), it will notify you in writing as follows:
    (a) If your request for relief is complete, MMS may either approve, 
deny, or modify your request in writing after consultation with any 
State required under Sec. 204.207(b).
    (1) If MMS approves your request for relief, MMS will notify you of 
the effective date of your accounting or auditing relief and other 
specifics of the relief approved.
    (2) If MMS denies your relief request, MMS will notify you of the 
reasons for denial and your appeal rights under Sec. 204.6.
    (3) If MMS modifies your relief request, MMS will notify you of the 
modifications.
    (i) You have 60 days from your receipt of MMS's notice to either 
accept or reject any modification(s) in writing.
    (ii) If you reject the modification(s) or fail to respond to MMS's 
notice, MMS will deny your relief request. MMS will notify you in 
writing of the reasons for denial and your appeal rights under Sec. 
204.6.
    (b) If your request for relief is not complete, MMS will notify you 
in writing that your request is incomplete and identify any missing 
information.
    (1) You must submit the missing information within 60 days of your 
receipt of MMS's notice that your request is incomplete.
    (2) After you submit all required information, MMS may approve, 
deny, or modify your request for relief under paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (3) If you do not submit all required information within 60 days of 
your receipt of MMS's notice that your request is incomplete, MMS will 
deny your relief request. MMS will notify you in writing of the reasons 
for denial and your appeal rights under Sec. 204.6.

[[Page 48]]

    (4) You may submit a new request for relief under this subpart at 
any time after MMS returns your incomplete request.


<R05>
Sec. 204.207  Who will approve, deny, or modify my request for 
accounting and auditing relief?

    (a) If there is not a State concerned for your marginal property, 
only MMS will decide whether to approve, deny, or modify your relief 
request.
    (b) If there is a State concerned for your marginal property that 
has determined in advance under Sec. 204.208 that it will allow either 
or both of the relief options under this subpart, MMS will decide 
whether to approve, deny, or modify your relief request after consulting 
with the State concerned.


<R05>
Sec. 204.208  May a State decide that it will or will not allow one or 
both of the relief options under this subpart?

    (a) A State may decide in advance that it will or will not allow one 
or both of the relief options specified in this subpart for a particular 
calendar year. If a State decides that it will not consent to one or 
both of the relief options, MMS will not grant that type of marginal 
property relief.
    (b) To help States decide whether to allow one or both of the relief 
options specified in this subpart, for each calendar year MMS will send 
States a Report of Marginal Properties by October 1 preceding the 
calendar year.
    (c) If a State decides under paragraph (a) of this section that it 
will or will not allow one or both of the relief options in this subpart 
during the next calendar year, within 30 days of the State's receipt of 
the Report of Marginal Properties under paragraph (b) of this section, 
the State must:
    (1) Notify the Associate Director for Minerals Revenue Management, 
MMS, in writing, of its intent to allow or not allow one or both of the 
relief options under this subpart; and
    (2) Specify in its notice of intent to MMS which relief option(s) it 
will allow or not allow.
    (d) If a State decides in advance under paragraph (a) of this 
section that it will not allow one or both of the relief options 
specified in this subpart, it may decide for subsequent calendar years 
that it will allow one or both of the relief options in this subpart. If 
it so decides, within 30 days of the State's receipt of the Report of 
Marginal Properties under paragraph (b) of this section, the State must:
    (1) Notify the Associate Director for Minerals Revenue Management, 
MMS, in writing, of its intent to allow one or both of the relief 
options allowed under this subpart during the next calendar year; and
    (2) Specify in its notice of intent to MMS which relief option(s) it 
will allow.
    (e) If a State does not notify MMS under paragraph (c) or (d) of 
this section, the State will be deemed to have decided not to allow 
either of the relief options under this subpart for the next calendar 
year.
    (f) MMS will publish a notice of the State s intent to allow or not 
allow certain relief options under this section in the Federal Register 
no later than 30 days before the beginning of the applicable calendar 
year.


<R05>
Sec. 204.209  What if a property ceases to qualify for relief obtained 
under this subpart?

    (a) A marginal property must qualify for relief under this subpart 
for each calendar year based on production during the base period for 
that calendar year. The notice or request you provided to MMS under 
Sec. 204.205 for the first calendar year that the property qualified 
for relief remains effective for successive calendar years if the 
property continues to qualify.
    (b) If a property is no longer eligible for relief for any reason 
during a calendar year other than the reason under Sec. 204.210 or 
paragraph (c) of this section, the relief for the property terminates as 
of December 31 of that calendar year. You must notify MMS in writing by 
December 31 that the relief for the property has terminated.
    (c) If you dispose of your interest in a marginal property during 
the calendar year, your relief terminates as of the end of the sales 
month in which you disposed of the property. Report and pay royalties 
for your production using the procedures in Sec. 204.202(e).

[[Page 49]]


<R05>
Sec. 204.210  What if a property is approved as part of a nonqualifying 
agreement?

    If the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or MMS's Offshore Minerals 
Management (OMM) retroactively approves a marginal property that 
qualified for relief for inclusion as part of an agreement that does not 
qualify for relief under this subpart, the property no longer qualifies 
for relief under this subpart then:
    (a) MMS will not retroactively rescind the marginal property relief 
for production from your property under Sec. 204.211;
    (b) Your marginal property relief terminates as of December 31 of 
the calendar year that you receive the BLM or OMM approval of your 
marginal property as part of a nonqualifying agreement; and
    (c) For the calendar year in which you receive the BLM or OMM 
approval, and for any previous period affected by the approval, the 
volumes on which you report and pay royalty for your lease must be 
amended to reflect all volumes produced on or allocated to your lease 
under the nonqualifying agreement as modified by BLM or OMM. Report and 
pay royalties for your production using the procedures in Sec. 
204.202(b).
    (d) If you owe additional royalties based on the retroactive 
agreement approval and do not pay your royalty by the date due in Sec. 
204.202(b), you will owe late payment interest determined under 30 CFR 
218.54 from the date your payment was due under Sec. 204.202 (b)(2) 
until the date MMS receives it.


<R05>
Sec. 204.211  When may MMS rescind relief for a property?

    (a) MMS may retroactively rescind the relief for your property if 
MMS determines that your property was not eligible for the relief 
obtained under this subpart because:
    (1) You did not submit a notice or request for relief under Sec. 
204.205;
    (2) You submitted erroneous information in the notice or request for 
relief you provided to MMS under Sec. 204.205 or in your royalty or 
production reports; or
    (3) Your property is no longer eligible for relief because 
production increased, but you failed to provide the notice required 
under Sec. 204.209(b).
    (b) MMS may rescind relief for your property if MMS decides to take 
royalty in kind.


<R05>
Sec. 204.212  What if I took relief for which I was ineligible?

    If you took relief under this subpart for a period for which you 
were not eligible, you:
    (a) May owe additional royalties and late payment interest 
determined under 30 CFR 218.54 from the date your additional payments 
were due until the date MMS receives them; and
    (b) May be subject to civil penalties.


<R05>
Sec. 204.213  May I obtain relief for a property that benefits from 
other Federal or State incentive programs?

    You may obtain accounting and auditing relief for production from a 
marginal property under this subpart even if the property benefits from 
other Federal or State production incentive programs.


<R05>
Sec. 204.214  Is minimum royalty due on a property for which I took 
relief?

    (a) If you took cumulative royalty reports and payment relief on a 
property under this subpart, minimum royalty is still due for that 
property by the date prescribed in your lease and in the amount 
prescribed therein.
    (b) If you pay minimum royalty on production from a marginal 
property during a calendar year for which you are taking cumulative 
royalty reports and payment relief, and:
    (1) The annual payment you owe under this subpart is greater than 
the minimum royalty you paid, you must pay the difference between the 
minimum royalty you paid and your annual payment due under this subpart; 
or
    (2) The annual payment you owe under this subpart is less than the 
minimum royalty you paid, you are not entitled to a credit because you 
must pay at least the minimum royalty amount on your lease each year.

<R05>
Sec. 204.215  Are the information collection requirements in this 
subpart approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)?

    OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained 
in this subpart under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and assigned OMB control 
number 1010-0155. See 30 CFR part 210 for details concerning your 
estimated reporting burden and how you may comment on the accuracy of

Sec. 206.50  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all oil production from Indian 
(Tribal and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage 
Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma). The purpose of this subpart 
is to establish the value of production, for royalty purposes, 
consistent with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and 
lease terms.
    (b) If the specific provisions of any Federal statute, treaty, 
settlement agreement between the Indian lessor and a lessee resulting 
from administrative or judicial litigation, or oil and gas lease subject 
to the requirements of this subpart are inconsistent with any regulation 
in this subpart, then the statute, treaty, lease provision or

[[Page 52]]

settlement agreement shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) All royalty payments made to MMS or Indian Tribes are subject to 
audit and adjustment.
    (d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the 
trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the 
administration of Indian oil and gas leases are discharged in accordance 
with the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, 
and lease terms.


<R05>
Sec. 206.51  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this subpart:
    Allowance means an approved or an MMS-initially accepted deduction 
in determining value for royalty purposes. Transportation allowance 
means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the 
lessee for moving oil to a point of sale or point of delivery off the 
lease, unit area, or communitized area, excluding gathering, or an 
approved or MMS-initially accepted deduction for costs of such 
transportation, determined by this subpart.
    Area means a geographic region at least as large as the defined 
limits of an oil and/or gas field in which oil and/or gas lease products 
have similar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the market place between independent, nonaffiliated 
persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For 
purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person 
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another 
person. For purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of 
ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms 
of ownership: ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control; 
ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control; and 
ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol 
which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, 
including the existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding 
any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, 
either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. MMS may 
require the lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-
length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements 
of this definition for that production month, as well as when the 
contract was executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.
    BIA means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the 
Interior.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees 
of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to 
processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that 
results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially 
in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface 
oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs 
vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually 
given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil 
and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields 
are located.
    Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central 
accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized 
area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, 
unit, or communitized area as approved by BLM operations personnel for 
onshore leases.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to an oil

[[Page 53]]

and gas lessee for the disposition of the oil produced. Gross proceeds 
includes, but is not limited to, payments to the lessee for certain 
services such as dehydration, measurement, and/or gathering to the 
extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no cost to the 
Indian lessor. Gross proceeds, as applied to oil, also includes, but is 
not limited to, reimbursements for harboring or terminaling fees. Tax 
reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even 
though the Indian royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Monies 
and other consideration, including the forms of consideration identified 
in this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally 
entitled but which it does not seek to collect through reasonable 
efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Indian allottee means any Indian for whom land or an interest in 
land is held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to 
Federal restriction against alienation.
    Indian Tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, 
community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any 
land or interest in land is held in trust by the United States or which 
is subject to Federal restriction against alienation.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a 
mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or 
extraction of, or removal of lease products--or the land area covered by 
that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lease products means any leased minerals attributable to, 
originating from, or allocated to Indian leases.
    Lessee means any person to whom an Indian Tribe, or an Indian 
allottee issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an 
obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This 
includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an 
operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed 
the royalty payment responsibility.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products which have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
    Load oil means any oil which has been used with respect to the 
operation of oil or gas wells for wellbore stimulation, workover, 
chemical treatment, or production purposes. It does not include oil used 
at the surface to place lease production in marketable condition.
    Marketable condition means lease products which are sufficiently 
free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be 
accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or 
area.
    Marketing affiliate means an affiliate of the lessee whose function 
is to acquire only the lessee's production and to market that 
production.
    Minimum royalty means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the 
lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing 
regulations.
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Net-back method (or workback method) means a method for calculating 
market value of oil at the lease. Under this method, costs of 
transportation, processing, or manufacturing are deducted from the 
proceeds received for the oil and any extracted, processed, or 
manufactured products, or from the value of the oil or any extracted, 
processed, or manufactured products at the first point at which 
reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a sale 
under an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of such 
products, to ascertain value at the lease.
    Net profit share (for applicable Indian lessees) means the specified 
share of the net profit from production of oil and gas as provided in 
the agreement.
    Oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase 
in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric 
pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and is 
marketed or used as such. Condensate recovered in lease separators or 
field facilities is considered to be oil. For purposes of royalty 
valuation, the term tar sands is defined separately from oil.

[[Page 54]]

    Oil shale means a kerogen-bearing rock (i.e., fossilized, insoluble, 
organic material). Separation of kerogen from oil shale may take place 
in situ or in surface retorts by various processes. The kerogen, upon 
distillation, will yield liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Posted price means the price specified in publicly available posted 
price bulletins, onshore terminal postings, or other price notices net 
of all adjustments for quality (e.g., API gravity, sulfur content, etc.) 
and location for oil in marketable condition.
    Processing means any process designed to remove elements or 
compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including 
absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally 
take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, 
mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression 
are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or 
temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of oil are made. Selling arrangements 
are described by illustration in MMS Royalty Management Program Oil and 
Gas Payor Handbook.
    Spot sales agreement means a contract wherein a seller agrees to 
sell to a buyer a specified amount of oil at a specified price over a 
fixed period, usually of short duration, which does not normally require 
a cancellation notice to terminate, and which does not contain an 
obligation, nor imply an intent, to continue in subsequent periods.
    Tar sands means any consolidated or unconsolidated rock (other than 
coal, oil shale, or gilsonite) that contains a hydrocarbonaceous 
material with a gas-free viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise at 
original reservoir temperature.

<R05>
Sec. 206.52  Valuation standards.

    (a)(1) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of oil from 
leases subject to this subpart shall be the value determined under this 
section less applicable allowances determined under this subpart.
    (2)(i) For any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may 
consider the highest price paid or offered for a major portion of 
production (major portion) in determining value for royalty purposes, if 
data are available to compute a major portion, MMS will, where 
practicable, compare the value determined in accordance with this 
section with the major portion. The value to be used in determining the 
value of production, for royalty purposes, shall be the higher of those 
two values.
    (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, major portion means the highest 
price paid or offered at the time of production for the major portion of 
oil production from the same field. The major portion will be calculated 
using like-quality oil sold under arm's-length contracts from the same 
field (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same 
area) for each month. All such oil production will be arrayed from 
highest price to lowest price (at the bottom).
    The major portion is that price at which 50 percent (by volume) plus 
1 barrel of the oil (starting from the bottom) is sold.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of oil which is sold under an arm's-length 
contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section. The 
lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is 
arm's-length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, 
is subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this 
section, oil which is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's 
marketing affiliate and then sold by the marketing affiliate under an 
arm's-length contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph 
based upon the sale by the marketing affiliate.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration

[[Page 55]]

actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the 
seller for the oil. If the contract does not reflect the total 
consideration, then MMS may require that the oil sold under that 
contract be valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. 
Value may not be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, 
including the additional consideration.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee under an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable 
value of the production because of misconduct by or between two 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the oil 
production be valued under the first applicable of paragraph (c)(2), 
(c)(3), (c)(4), or (c)(5) of this section. When MMS determines that the 
value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give the 
lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's value. If the oil production is then valued under paragraph 
(c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section, the notification requirements of 
paragraph (e) of this section shall apply.
    (2) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the oil.
    (c) The value of oil production from leases subject to this section 
which is not sold under an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable 
value determined in accordance with the first applicable of the 
following paragraphs:
    (1) The lessee's contemporaneous posted prices or oil sales contract 
prices used in arm's-length transactions for purchases or sales of 
significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if 
necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area); provided, 
however, that those posted prices or oil sales contract prices are 
comparable to other contemporaneous posted prices or oil sales contract 
prices used in arm's-length transactions for purchases or sales of 
significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field (or, if 
necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area). In 
evaluating the comparability of posted prices or oil sales contract 
prices, the following factors shall be considered: Price, duration, 
market or markets served, terms, quality of oil, volume, and other 
factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the oil. If the 
lessee makes arm's-length purchases or sales at different postings or 
prices, then the volume-weighted average price for the purchases or 
sales for the production month will be used;
    (2) The arithmetic average of contemporaneous posted prices used in 
arm's-length transactions by persons other than the lessee for purchases 
or sales of significant quantities of like-quality oil in the same field 
(or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area);
    (3) The arithmetic average of other contemporaneous arm's-length 
contract prices for purchases or sales of significant quantities of 
like-quality oil in the same area or nearby areas;
    (4) Prices received for arm's-length spot sales of significant 
quantities of like-quality oil from the same field (or, if necessary to 
obtain a reasonable sample, from the same area), and other relevant 
matters, including information submitted by the lessee concerning 
circumstances unique to a particular lease operation or the salability 
of certain types of oil;
    (5) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value;
    (6) For purposes of this paragraph, the term lessee includes the 
lessee's designated purchasing agent, and the term contemporaneous means 
postings or contract prices in effect at the time the royalty obligation 
is incurred.
    (d) Any Indian lessee will make available, upon request to the 
authorized MMS or Indian representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Interior, or other persons authorized 
to receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for 
like-quality production sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the 
lessee from the field or area or from nearby fields or areas.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined under paragraph (c) of this 
section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to

[[Page 56]]

the determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review 
and audit, and MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it 
determines that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements 
of these regulations.
    (2) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value under 
paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to MMS Associate Director for Minerals Revenue Management or his/
her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used 
and contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The 
notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due 
no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized 
by paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section and each time there is a 
change from one to the other of these two methods.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on the difference computed under 30 CFR 218.54. If the 
lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for the 
taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that value for royalty payment purposes until MMS issues a value 
determination. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant to 
its proposal. MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based upon the 
lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems necessary. In 
making a value determination, MMS may use any of the valuation criteria 
authorized by this subpart. That determination shall remain effective 
for the period stated therein. After MMS issues its determination, the 
lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production, for royalty purposes, be 
less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease 
production, less applicable allowances determined under this subpart.
    (i) The lessee is required to place oil in marketable condition at 
no cost to the Indian lessor unless otherwise provided in the lease 
agreement or this section. Where the value established under this 
section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value shall be 
increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced 
because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain 
services the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the 
lessee to place the oil in marketable condition.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee makes timely 
application for a price increase or benefit allowed under its contract 
but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable measures, 
which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe 
no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration 
resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. 
This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its 
royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, 
in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of oil.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Indian Tribes or 
allottees until the audit period is formally closed.

[[Page 57]]

    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation allowances or extraordinary cost 
allowances, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this part 
are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 
regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2. Nothing in 
this section is intended to limit or diminish in any manner whatsoever 
the right of an Indian lessor to obtain any and all information to which 
such lessor may be lawfully entitled from MMS or such lessor's lessee 
directly under the terms of the lease, 30 U.S.C. 1733, or other 
applicable law.


<R05>
Sec. 206.53  Point of royalty settlement.

    (a)(1) Royalties shall be computed on the quantity and quality of 
oil as measured at the point of settlement approved by BLM for onshore 
leases.
    (2) If the value of oil determined under Sec. 206.52 of this 
subpart is based upon a quantity and/or quality different from the 
quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement approved by 
the BLM for onshore leases, the value shall be adjusted for those 
differences in quantity and/or quality.
    (b) No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty 
value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss that may be 
sustained prior to the royalty settlement metering or measurement point 
will not be subject to royalty provided that such actual loss is 
determined to have been unavoidable by BLM.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, royalties 
are due on 100 percent of the volume measured at the approved point of 
royalty settlement. There can be no reduction in that measured volume 
for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty settlement or for 
theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken place either prior to 
or beyond the approved point of royalty settlement. Royalties are due on 
100 percent of the value of the oil as provided in this subpart. There 
can be no deduction from the value of the oil for royalty purposes to 
compensate for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty 
settlement or for theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken 
place either prior to or beyond the approved point of royalty 
settlement.

<R05>
Sec. 206.54  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of oil has been determined under Section 206.52 
of this subpart at a point (e.g., sales point or point of value 
determination) off the lease, MMS shall allow a deduction for the 
reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee to transport oil to a 
point off the lease; provided, however, that no transportation allowance 
will be granted for transporting oil taken as Royalty-In-Kind (RIK); or
    (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling arrangement 
shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the oil at the point of sale 
as determined under Sec. 206.52 of this subpart. Transportation costs 
cannot be transferred between selling arrangements or to other products.
    (2) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a transportation 
allowance deduction in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. The lessee must demonstrate that the 
transportation costs incurred in excess of the limitation prescribed in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. 
An application for exception (using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed 
Regulatory Allowance Limitation) shall contain all relevant and 
supporting documentation necessary for MMS to make a determination. 
Under no circumstances shall the value, for royalty purposes, under any 
selling arrangement, be reduced to zero.
    (c) Transportation costs must be allocated among all products 
produced and transported as provided in Sec. 206.55.

[[Page 58]]

Transportation allowances for oil shall be expressed as dollars per 
barrel.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
subpart, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest.


<R05>
Sec. 206.55  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length transportation contracts. (1)(i) For transportation 
costs incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the 
transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred 
by the lessee for transporting oil under that contract, except as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, 
subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall 
have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. Such 
allowances shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this 
section. Before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed page one of Form MMS-4110 (and Schedule 1), Oil Transportation 
Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A 
transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of 
not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form 
MMS-4110 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a 
showing of good cause by the lessee.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration, then MMS may require that the transportation allowance be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-
length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of 
the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the 
lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and 
the lessor, then MMS shall require that the transportation allowance be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, MMS 
will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.
    (2)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one liquid product, and the transportation costs attributable to each 
product cannot be determined from the contract, then the total 
transportation costs shall be allocated in a consistent and equitable 
manner to each of the liquid products transported in the same proportion 
as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products 
which have no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding 
waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this 
paragraph, no allowance may be taken for the costs of transporting lease 
production which is not royalty-bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (3) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous 
and liquid products, and the transportation costs attributable to each 
product cannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose 
an allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the oil 
transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed 
allocation procedure until MMS issues its determination on the 
acceptability of the cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all 
available data to support its proposal. The initial proposal must be 
submitted by June 30, 1988 or within 3 months after the last day of the 
month for which the lessee requests a transportation allowance, 
whichever is later (unless MMS approves a longer period).

[[Page 59]]

MMS shall then determine the oil transportation allowance based upon the 
lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems necessary.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for 
the purposes of this section.
    (5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price, or a posted price, 
includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a 
transportation factor, MMS will not consider the transportation factor 
to be a transportation allowance. The transportation factor may be used 
in determining the lessee's gross proceeds for the sale of the product. 
The transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of 
the product without MMS approval.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, 
the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable, 
actual costs as provided in this paragraph. All transportation 
allowances deducted under a non-arms-length or no-contract situation are 
subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. Before any 
estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed Form MMS-4110 in its entirety in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section. A transportation allowance may be claimed 
retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months prior to the first 
day of the month that Form MMS-4110 is filed with MMS, unless MMS 
approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by the lessee. MMS 
will monitor the allowance deductions to determine whether lessees are 
taking deductions that are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or 
appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its actual transportation 
allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arms-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial capital 
investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate of return 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets 
(including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) 
which are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. 
State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, 
including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. After a lessee has elected to use either method for 
a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the 
other alternative without approval of MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services or on 
a unit-of-production method. After an election is made, the lessee may 
not change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change

[[Page 60]]

in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only once. 
Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the initial capital 
investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return 
determined under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall 
be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to 
transportation facilities first placed in service after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is 
applicable and shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate 
shall be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent transportation 
allowance reporting period (which is determined under paragraph (c) of 
this section).
    (3)(i) The deduction for transportation costs shall be determined on 
the basis of the lessee's cost of transporting each product through each 
individual transportation system. Where more than one liquid product is 
transported, allocation of costs to each of the liquid products 
transported shall be in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume 
of each liquid product (excluding waste products which have no value) to 
the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products which have 
no value) and such allocation shall be made in a consistent and 
equitable manner. Except as provided in this paragraph, the lessee may 
not take an allowance for transporting lease production which is not 
royalty-bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (4) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through 
the same transportation system, the lessee shall propose a cost 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the oil transportation 
allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination on the acceptability of the 
cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all available data to support 
its proposal. The initial proposal must be submitted by June 30, 1988 or 
within 3 months after the last day of the month for which the lessee 
requests a transportation allowance, whichever is later (unless MMS 
approves a longer period). MMS shall then determine the oil 
transportation allowance on the basis of the lessee's proposal and any 
additional information MMS deems necessary.
    (5) A lessee may apply to MMS for an exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(4) of this section. MMS will grant the exception only if the 
lessee has a tariff for the transportation system approved by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for Indian leases. MMS shall 
deny the exception request if it determines that the tariff is excessive 
as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by pipelines, owned 
by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in 
that area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, MMS 
shall deny the exception request if:
    (i) No FERC cost analysis exists and the FERC has declined to 
investigate under MMS timely objections upon filing; and
    (ii) the tariff significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation as determined under this section.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the 
exception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page 
one of the initial Form MMS-4110 (and Schedule 1), Oil Transportation 
Allowance Report, prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation 
allowance determined, under an arm's-length contract, is reported on 
Form MMS-2014, Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance. A Form

[[Page 61]]

MMS-4110 received by the end of the month that the Form MMS-2014 is due 
shall be considered to be timely received.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4110 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is 
modified or amended, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding 
reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form MMS-4110 (and 
Schedule 1) within 3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after 
the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, 
whichever is earlier, unless MMS approves a longer period (during which 
period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous 
reporting period).
    (iv) MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (v) Transportation allowances which are based on arm's-length 
contracts and which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those 
transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v), (c)(2)(vii) 
and (c)(2)(viii) of this section, the lessee shall submit an initial 
Form MMS-4110 prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation 
allowance determined under a non-arm's-length contract or no-contract 
situation is reported on Form MMS-2014. A Form MMS-4110 received by the 
end of the month that the Form MMS-2014 is due shall be considered to be 
timely received. The initial report may be based upon estimated costs.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4110 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until transportation under the non-arm's-length 
contract or the no-contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial 
reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4110 
containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If oil 
transportation is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4110 
its estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated oil 
transportation allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the 
previous reporting period plus or minus any adjustments which are based 
on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases that will affect the 
allowance. MMS must receive the Form MMS-4110 within 3 months after the 
end of the previous reporting period, unless MMS approves a longer 
period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the 
allowance from the previous reporting period).
    (iv) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial Form MMS-4110 shall include estimates of the allowable oil 
transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be 
based upon the most recently available operations data for the 
transportation system or, if such data are not available, the lessee 
shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation 
systems.
    (v) Non-arm's-length contract or no-contract transportation 
allowances which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.

[[Page 62]]

    (vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare its Form MMS-4110. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (vii) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (viii) If the lessee is authorized to use its FERC-approved tariff 
as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section.
    (3) MMS may establish reporting dates for individual lessees 
different from those specified in this subpart in order to provide more 
effective administration. Lessees will be notified of any change in 
their reporting period.
    (4) Transportation allowances must be reported as a separate line 
item on Form MMS-2014, unless MMS approves a different reporting 
procedure.
    (d) Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and for 
failure to report. (1) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on 
its Form MMS-2014 without complying with the requirements of this 
section, the lessee shall pay interest only on the amount of such 
deduction until the requirements of this section are complied with. The 
lessee also shall repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed 
by this section.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required 
to pay additional royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 
218.54, retroactive to the first day of the first month the lessee is 
authorized to deduct a transportation allowance. If the actual 
transportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken 
on Form MMS-2014 for each month during the allowance form reporting 
period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (2) For lessees transporting production from Indian leases, the 
lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual costs, 
together with any payment, in accordance with instructions provided by 
MMS.
    (f) Actual or theoretical losses. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this subpart, for other than arm's-length contracts, no 
cost shall be allowed for oil transportation which results from payments 
(either volumetric or for value) for actual or theoretical losses. This 
section does not apply when the transportation allowance is based upon a 
FERC or State regulatory agency approved tariff.
    (g) Other transportation cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing 
value using a netback valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of transportation costs.

<R05>
Sec. 206.100  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    (a) This subpart applies to all oil produced from Federal oil and 
gas leases onshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It explains 
how you as a lessee must calculate the value of production for royalty 
purposes consistent with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable 
laws, and lease terms.
    (b) If you are a designee and if you dispose of production on behalf 
of a lessee, the terms ``you'' and ``your'' in this subpart refer to you 
and not to the lessee. In this circumstance, you must determine and 
report royalty value for the lessee's oil by applying the rules in this 
subpart to your disposition of the lessee's oil.
    (c) If you are a designee and only report for a lessee, and do not 
dispose of the lessee's production, references to ``you'' and ``your'' 
in this subpart refer to the lessee and not the designee. In this 
circumstance, you as a designee must determine and report royalty

[[Page 63]]

value for the lessee's oil by applying the rules in this subpart to the 
lessee's disposition of its oil.
    (d) If the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with:
    (1) A Federal statute;
    (2) A settlement agreement between the United States and a lessee 
resulting from administrative or judicial litigation;
    (3) A written agreement between the lessee and the MMS Director 
establishing a method to determine the value of production from any 
lease that MMS expects at least would approximate the value established 
under this subpart; or
    (4) An express provision of an oil and gas lease subject to this 
subpart, then the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or 
lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency.
    (e) MMS may audit and adjust all royalty payments.


<R05>
Sec. 206.101  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    The following definitions apply to this subpart:
    Affiliate means a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under 
common control with another person. For purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Ownership or common ownership of more than 50 percent of the 
voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of 
ownership, of another person constitutes control. Ownership of less than 
10 percent constitutes a presumption of noncontrol that MMS may rebut.
    (2) If there is ownership or common ownership of 10 through 50 
percent of the voting securities or instruments of ownership, or other 
forms of ownership, of another person, MMS will consider the following 
factors in determining whether there is control under the circumstances 
of a particular case:
    (i) The extent to which there are common officers or directors;
    (ii) With respect to the voting securities, or instruments of 
ownership, or other forms of ownership: the percentage of ownership or 
common ownership, the relative percentage of ownership or common 
ownership compared to the percentage(s) of ownership by other persons, 
whether a person is the greatest single owner, or whether there is an 
opposing voting bloc of greater ownership;
    (iii) Operation of a lease, plant, or other facility;
    (iv) The extent of participation by other owners in operations and 
day-to-day management of a lease, plant, or other facility; and
    (v) Other evidence of power to exercise control over or common 
control with another person.
    (3) Regardless of any percentage of ownership or common ownership, 
relatives, either by blood or marriage, are affiliates.
    ANS means Alaska North Slope (ANS).
    Area means a geographic region at least as large as the limits of an 
oil field, in which oil has similar quality, economic, and legal 
characteristics.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement between 
independent persons who are not affiliates and who have opposing 
economic interests regarding that contract. To be considered arm's 
length for any production month, a contract must satisfy this definition 
for that month, as well as when the contract was executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted under generally accepted accounting 
and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of 
lessees, designees or other persons who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses 
on Federal leases.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees 
of API gravity) recovered at the surface without processing. Condensate 
is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons resulting from condensation of 
petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially in a gaseous phase in an 
underground reservoir.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions, between two or more persons, that is enforceable by law 
and that with due consideration creates an obligation.

[[Page 64]]

    Designee means the person the lessee designates to report and pay 
the lessee's royalties for a lease.
    Exchange agreement means an agreement where one person agrees to 
deliver oil to another person at a specified location in exchange for 
oil deliveries at another location. Exchange agreements may or may not 
specify prices for the oil involved. They frequently specify dollar 
amounts reflecting location, quality, or other differentials. Exchange 
agreements include buy/sell agreements, which specify prices to be paid 
at each exchange point and may appear to be two separate sales within 
the same agreement. Examples of other types of exchange agreements 
include, but are not limited to, exchanges of produced oil for specific 
types of crude oil (e.g., West Texas Intermediate); exchanges of 
produced oil for other crude oil at other locations (Location Trades); 
exchanges of produced oil for other grades of oil (Grade Trades); and 
multi-party exchanges.
    Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface 
oil and gas reservoirs and encompassing at least the outermost 
boundaries of all oil and gas accumulations known within those 
reservoirs, vertically projected to the land surface. State oil and gas 
regulatory agencies usually name onshore fields and designate their 
official boundaries. MMS names and designates boundaries of OCS fields.
    Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central 
accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized 
area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, 
unit, or communitized area that BLM or MMS approves for onshore and 
offshore leases, respectively.
    Gross proceeds means the total monies and other consideration 
accruing for the disposition of oil produced. Gross proceeds also 
include, but are not limited to, the following examples:
    (1) Payments for services such as dehydration, marketing, 
measurement, or gathering which the lessee must perform at no cost to 
the Federal Government;
    (2) The value of services, such as salt water disposal, that the 
producer normally performs but that the buyer performs on the producer's 
behalf;
    (3) Reimbursements for harboring or terminaling fees;
    (4) Tax reimbursements, even though the Federal royalty interest may 
be exempt from taxation;
    (5) Payments made to reduce or buy down the purchase price of oil to 
be produced in later periods, by allocating such payments over the 
production whose price the payment reduces and including the allocated 
amounts as proceeds for the production as it occurs; and
    (6) Monies and all other consideration to which a seller is 
contractually or legally entitled, but does not seek to collect through 
reasonable efforts.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a 
mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or 
extraction of, or removal of oil or gas--or the land area covered by 
that authorization, whichever the context requires.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues an oil and 
gas lease, an assignee of all or a part of the record title interest, or 
any person to whom operating rights in a lease have been assigned.
    Location differential means an amount paid or received (whether in 
money or in barrels of oil) under an exchange agreement that results 
from differences in location between oil delivered in exchange and oil 
received in the exchange. A location differential may represent all or 
part of the difference between the price received for oil delivered and 
the price paid for oil received under a buy/sell exchange agreement.
    Market center means a major point MMS recognizes for oil sales, 
refining, or transshipment. Market centers generally are locations where 
MMS-approved publications publish oil spot prices.
    Marketable condition means oil sufficiently free from impurities and 
otherwise in a condition a purchaser will accept under a sales contract 
typical for the field or area.

[[Page 65]]

    MMS-approved publication means a publication MMS approves for 
determining ANS spot prices or WTI differentials.
    Netting means reducing the reported sales value to account for 
transportation instead of reporting a transportation allowance as a 
separate entry on Form MMS-2014.
    NYMEX price means the average of the New York Mercantile Exchange 
(NYMEX) settlement prices for light sweet crude oil delivered at 
Cushing, Oklahoma, calculated as follows:
    (1) Sum the prices published for each day during the calendar month 
of production (excluding weekends and holidays) for oil to be delivered 
in the prompt month corresponding to each such day; and
    (2) Divide the sum by the number of days on which those prices are 
published (excluding weekends and holidays).
    Oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase 
in natural underground reservoirs, remains liquid at atmospheric 
pressure after passing through surface separating facilities, and is 
marketed or used as a liquid. Condensate recovered in lease separators 
or field facilities is oil.
    Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) means all submerged lands lying 
seaward and outside of the area of lands beneath navigable waters as 
defined in Section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) and of 
which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are 
subject to its jurisdiction and control.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Prompt month means the nearest month of delivery for which NYMEX 
futures prices are published during the trading month.
    Quality differential means an amount paid or received under an 
exchange agreement (whether in money or in barrels of oil) that results 
from differences in API gravity, sulfur content, viscosity, metals 
content, and other quality factors between oil delivered and oil 
received in the exchange. A quality differential may represent all or 
part of the difference between the price received for oil delivered and 
the price paid for oil received under a buy/sell agreement.
    Rocky Mountain Region means the States of Colorado, Montana, North 
Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, except for those portions of 
the San Juan Basin and other oil-producing fields in the ``Four 
Corners'' area that lie within Colorado and Utah.
    Roll means an adjustment to the NYMEX price that is calculated as 
follows:
    Roll = .6667 x (P<INF>0</INF>-P<INF>1</INF>) + .3333 x 
(P<INF>0</INF>-P<INF>2</INF>), where: P<INF>0</INF> = the average of the 
daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the prompt month 
that is the same as the month of production, as published for each day 
during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt 
month; P<INF>1</INF> = the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices 
for deliveries during the month following the month of production, 
published for each day during the trading month for which the month of 
production is the prompt month; and P<INF>2</INF> = the average of the 
daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the second month 
following the month of production, as published for each day during the 
trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month. 
Calculate the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices using only 
the days on which such prices are published (excluding weekends and 
holidays).
    (1) Example 1. Prices in Out Months are Lower Going Forward: The 
month of production for which you must determine royalty value is March. 
March was the prompt month (for year 2003) from January 22 through 
February 20. April was the first month following the month of 
production, and May was the second month following the month of 
production. P<INF>0</INF> therefore is the average of the daily NYMEX 
settlement prices for deliveries during March published for each 
business day between January 22 and February 20. P<INF>1</INF> is the 
average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during April 
published for each business day between January 22 and February 20. 
P<INF>2</INF> is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for 
deliveries during May published for each business day between January 22

[[Page 66]]

and February 20. In this example, assume that P<INF>0</INF> = $28.00 per 
bbl, P<INF>1</INF> = $27.70 per bbl, and P<INF>2</INF> = $27.10 per bbl. 
In this example (a declining market), Roll = .6667 x ($28.00-$27.70) + 
.3333 x ($28.00-$27.10) = $.20 + $.30 = $.50. You add this number to the 
NYMEX price.
    (2) Example 2. Prices in Out Months are Higher Going Forward: The 
month of production for which you must determine royalty value is July. 
July 2003 was the prompt month from May 21 through June 20. August was 
the first month following the month of production, and September was the 
second month following the month of production. P<INF>0</INF> therefore 
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries 
during July published for each business day between May 21 and June 20. 
P<INF>1</INF> is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for 
deliveries during August published for each business day between May 21 
and June 20. P<INF>2</INF> is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement 
prices for deliveries during September published for each business day 
between May 21 and June 20. In this example, assume that P<INF>0</INF> = 
$28.00 per bbl, P<INF>1</INF> = $28.90 per bbl, and P<INF>2</INF> = 
$29.50 per bbl. In this example (a rising market), Roll = .6667 x 
($28.00-$28.90) + .3333 x ($28.00-$29.50) = (-$.60) + (-$.50) = -$1.10. 
You add this negative number to the NYMEX price (effectively a 
subtraction from the NYMEX price).
    Sale means a contract between two persons where:
    (1) The seller unconditionally transfers title to the oil to the 
buyer and does not retain any related rights such as the right to buy 
back similar quantities of oil from the buyer elsewhere;
    (2) The buyer pays money or other consideration for the oil; and
    (3) The parties' intent is for a sale of the oil to occur.
    Spot price means the price under a spot sales contract where:
    (1) A seller agrees to sell to a buyer a specified amount of oil at 
a specified price over a specified period of short duration;
    (2) No cancellation notice is required to terminate the sales 
agreement; and
    (3) There is no obligation or implied intent to continue to sell in 
subsequent periods.
    Tendering program means a producer's offer of a portion of its crude 
oil produced from a field or area for competitive bidding, regardless of 
whether the production is offered or sold at or near the lease or unit 
or away from the lease or unit.
    Trading month means the period extending from the second business 
day before the 25th day of the second calendar month preceding the 
delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, 
the second business day before the last business day preceding the 25th 
day of that month) through the third business day before the 25th day of 
the calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of 
that month is a non-business day, the third business day before the last 
business day preceding the 25th day of that month), unless the NYMEX 
publishes a different definition or different dates on its official Web 
site, www.nymex.com, in which case the NYMEX definition will apply.
    Transportation allowance means a deduction in determining royalty 
value for the reasonable, actual costs of moving oil to a point of sale 
or delivery off the lease, unit area, or communitized area. The 
transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.
    WTI differential means the average of the daily mean differentials 
for location and quality between a grade of crude oil at a market center 
and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil at Cushing published for 
each day for which price publications perform surveys for deliveries 
during the production month, calculated over the number of days on which 
those differentials are published (excluding weekends and holidays). 
Calculate the daily mean differentials by averaging the daily high and 
low differentials for the month in the selected publication. Use only 
the days and corresponding differentials for which such differentials 
are published.
    (1) Example. Assume the production month was March 2003. Industry 
trade publications performed their price surveys and determined 
differentials during January 26 through February 25 for oil delivered in 
March. The WTI differential (for example, the West Texas Sour crude at 
Midland, Texas, spread

[[Page 67]]

versus WTI) applicable to valuing oil produced in the March 2003 
production month would be determined using all the business days for 
which differentials were published during the period January 26 through 
February 25 excluding weekends and holidays (22 days). To calculate the 
WTI differential, add together all of the daily mean differentials 
published for January 26 through February 25 and divide that sum by 22.

<R05>
Sec. 206.102  How do I calculate royalty value for oil that I or my 
affiliate sell(s) under an arm's-length contract?

    (a) The value of oil under this section is the gross proceeds 
accruing to the seller under the arm's-length contract, less applicable 
allowances determined under Sec. Sec. 206.110 or 206.111. This value 
does not apply if you exercise an option to use a different value 
provided in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2)(i) of this section, or if one of 
the exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section applies. Use this 
paragraph (a) to value oil that:
    (1) You sell under an arm's-length sales contract; or
    (2) You sell or transfer to your affiliate or another person under a 
non-arm's-length contract and that affiliate or person, or another 
affiliate of either of them, then sells the oil under an arm's-length 
contract, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d)(2)(i) 
of this section.
    (b) If you have multiple arm's-length contracts to sell oil produced 
from a lease that is valued under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
value of the oil is the volume-weighted average of the values 
established under this section for each contract for the sale of oil 
produced from that lease.
    (c) This paragraph contains exceptions to the valuation rule in 
paragraph (a) of this section. Apply these exceptions on an individual 
contract basis.
    (1) In conducting reviews and audits, if MMS determines that any 
arm's-length sales contract does not reflect the total consideration 
actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the 
seller, MMS may require that you value the oil sold under that contract 
either under Sec. 206.103 or at the total consideration received.
    (2) You must value the oil under Sec. 206.103 if MMS determines 
that the value under paragraph (a) of this section does not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production due to either:
    (i) Misconduct by or between the parties to the arm's-length 
contract; or
    (ii) Breach of your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of 
yourself and the lessor.
    (A) MMS will not use this provision to simply substitute its 
judgment of the market value of the oil for the proceeds received by the 
seller under an arm's-length sales contract.
    (B) The fact that the price received by the seller under an arm's 
length contract is less than other measures of market price, such as 
index prices, is insufficient to establish breach of the duty to market 
unless MMS finds additional evidence that the seller acted unreasonably 
or in bad faith in the sale of oil from the lease.
    (d)(1) If you enter into an arm's-length exchange agreement, or 
multiple sequential arm's-length exchange agreements, and following the 
exchange(s) you or your affiliate sell(s) the oil received in the 
exchange(s) under an arm's-length contract, then you may use either 
Sec. 206.102(a) or Sec.  206.103 to value your production for royalty 
purposes.
    (i) If you use Sec. 206.102(a), your gross proceeds are the gross 
proceeds under your or your affiliate's arm's-length sales contract 
after the exchange(s) occur(s). You must adjust your gross proceeds for 
any location or quality differential, or other adjustments, you received 
or paid under the arm's-length exchange agreement(s). If MMS determines 
that any arm's-length exchange agreement does not reflect reasonable 
location or quality differentials, MMS may require you to value the oil 
under Sec. 206.103. You may not otherwise use the price or differential 
specified in an arm's-length exchange agreement to value your 
production.
    (ii) When you elect under Sec. 206.102(d)(1) to use Sec.  
206.102(a) or

[[Page 68]]

Sec. 206.103, you must make the same election for all of your 
production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if 
the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) sold under 
arm's-length contracts following arm's-length exchange agreements. You 
may not change your election more often than once every 2 years.
    (2)(i) If you sell or transfer your oil production to your affiliate 
and that affiliate or another affiliate then sells the oil under an 
arm's-length contract, you may use either Sec. 206.102(a) or Sec.  
206.103 to value your production for royalty purposes.
    (ii) When you elect under Sec. 206.102(d)(2)(i) to use Sec.  
206.102(a) or Sec. 206.103, you must make the same election for all of 
your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease 
(if the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) that 
your affiliates resell at arm's length. You may not change your election 
more often than once every 2 years.
    (e) If you value oil under paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) MMS may require you to certify that your or your affiliate's 
arm's-length contract provisions include all of the consideration the 
buyer must pay, either directly or indirectly, for the oil.
    (2) You must base value on the highest price the seller can receive 
through legally enforceable claims under the contract.
    (i) If the seller fails to take proper or timely action to receive 
prices or benefits it is entitled to, you must pay royalty at a value 
based upon that obtainable price or benefit. But you will owe no 
additional royalties unless or until the seller receives monies or 
consideration resulting from the price increase or additional benefits, 
if:
    (A) The seller makes timely application for a price increase or 
benefit allowed under the contract;
    (B) The purchaser refuses to comply; and
    (C) The seller takes reasonable documented measures to force 
purchaser compliance.
    (ii) Paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section will not permit you to 
avoid your royalty payment obligation where a purchaser fails to pay, 
pays only in part, or pays late. Any contract revisions or amendments 
that reduce prices or benefits to which the seller is entitled must be 
in writing and signed by all parties to the arm's-length contract.


<R05>
Sec. 206.103  How do I value oil that is not sold under an arm's-length 
contract?

    This section explains how to value oil that you may not value under 
Sec. 206.102 or that you elect under Sec.  206.102(d) to value under 
this section. First determine whether paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this 
section applies to production from your lease, or whether you may apply 
paragraph (d) or (e) with MMS approval.
    (a) Production from leases in California or Alaska. Value is the 
average of the daily mean ANS spot prices published in any MMS-approved 
publication during the trading month most concurrent with the production 
month. (For example, if the production month is June, compute the 
average of the daily mean prices using the daily ANS spot prices 
published in the MMS-approved publication for all the business days in 
June.)
    (1) To calculate the daily mean spot price, average the daily high 
and low prices for the month in the selected publication.
    (2) Use only the days and corresponding spot prices for which such 
prices are published.
    (3) You must adjust the value for applicable location and quality 
differentials, and you may adjust it for transportation costs, under 
Sec. 206.112.
    (4) After you select an MMS-approved publication, you may not select 
a different publication more often than once every 2 years, unless the 
publication you use is no longer published or MMS revokes its approval 
of the publication. If you are required to change publications, you must 
begin a new 2-year period.
    (b) Production from leases in the Rocky Mountain Region. This 
paragraph provides methods and options for valuing your production under 
different factual situations. You must consistently apply paragraph 
(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)

[[Page 69]]

of this section to value all of your production from the same unit, 
communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease or a portion of the 
lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) that you 
cannot value under Sec. 206.102 or that you elect under Sec.  
206.102(d) to value under this section.
    (1) If you have an MMS-approved tendering program, you must value 
oil produced from leases in the area the tendering program covers at the 
highest winning bid price for tendered volumes.
    (i) The minimum requirements for MMS to approve your tendering 
program are:
    (A) You must offer and sell at least 30 percent of your or your 
affiliates' production from both Federal and non-Federal leases in the 
area under your tendering program; and
    (B) You must receive at least three bids for the tendered volumes 
from bidders who do not have their own tendering programs that cover 
some or all of the same area.
    (ii) If you do not have an MMS-approved tendering program, you may 
elect to value your oil under either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this 
section. After you select either paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this 
section, you may not change to the other method more often than once 
every 2 years, unless the method you have been using is no longer 
applicable and you must apply the other paragraph. If you change 
methods, you must begin a new 2-year period.
    (2) Value is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds 
accruing to the seller under your or your affiliates' arm's-length 
contracts for the purchase or sale of production from the field or area 
during the production month.
    (i) The total volume purchased or sold under those contracts must 
exceed 50 percent of your and your affiliates' production from both 
Federal and non-Federal leases in the same field or area during that 
month.
    (ii) Before calculating the volume-weighted average, you must 
normalize the quality of the oil in your or your affiliates' arm's-
length purchases or sales to the same gravity as that of the oil 
produced from the lease.
    (3) Value is the NYMEX price (without the roll), adjusted for 
applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs 
under Sec. 206.112.
    (4) If you demonstrate to MMS's satisfaction that paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(3) of this section result in an unreasonable value for your 
production as a result of circumstances regarding that production, the 
MMS Director may establish an alternative valuation method.
    (c) Production from leases not located in California, Alaska, or the 
Rocky Mountain Region. (1) Value is the NYMEX price, plus the roll, 
adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and 
transportation costs under Sec. 206.112.
    (2) If the MMS Director determines that use of the roll no longer 
reflects prevailing industry practice in crude oil sales contracts or 
that the most common formula used by industry to calculate the roll 
changes, MMS may terminate or modify use of the roll under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section at the end of each 2-year period following July 
6, 2004, through notice published in the Federal Register not later than 
60 days before the end of the 2-year period. MMS will explain the 
rationale for terminating or modifying the use of the roll in this 
notice.
    (d) Unreasonable value. If MMS determines that the NYMEX price or 
ANS spot price does not represent a reasonable royalty value in any 
particular case, MMS may establish reasonable royalty value based on 
other relevant matters.
    (e) Production delivered to your refinery and the NYMEX price or ANS 
spot price is an unreasonable value. (1) Instead of valuing your 
production under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, you may 
apply to the MMS Director to establish a value representing the market 
at the refinery if:
    (i) You transport your oil directly to your or your affiliate's 
refinery, or exchange your oil for oil delivered to your or your 
affiliate's refinery; and
    (ii) You must value your oil under this section at the NYMEX price 
or ANS spot price; and
    (iii) You believe that use of the NYMEX price or ANS spot price 
results in an unreasonable royalty value.

[[Page 70]]

    (2) You must provide adequate documentation and evidence 
demonstrating the market value at the refinery. That evidence may 
include, but is not limited to:
    (i) Costs of acquiring other crude oil at or for the refinery;
    (ii) How adjustments for quality, location, and transportation were 
factored into the price paid for other oil;
    (iii) Volumes acquired for and refined at the refinery; and
    (iv) Any other appropriate evidence or documentation that MMS 
requires.
    (3) If the MMS Director establishes a value representing market 
value at the refinery, you may not take an allowance against that value 
under Sec. 206.112(b) unless it is included in the Director's approval.

69 FR 24976, May 5, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 206.104  What publications are acceptable to MMS?

    (a) MMS periodically will publish in the Federal Register a list of 
acceptable publications for the NYMEX price and ANS spot price based on 
certain criteria, including, but not limited to:
    (1) Publications buyers and sellers frequently use;
    (2) Publications frequently mentioned in purchase or sales 
contracts;
    (3) Publications that use adequate survey techniques, including 
development of estimates based on daily surveys of buyers and sellers of 
crude oil, and, for ANS spot prices, buyers and sellers of ANS crude 
oil; and
    (4) Publications independent from MMS, other lessors, and lessees.
    (b) Any publication may petition MMS to be added to the list of 
acceptable publications.
    (c) MMS will specify the tables you must use in the acceptable 
publications.
    (d) MMS may revoke its approval of a particular publication if it 
determines that the prices or differentials published in the publication 
do not accurately represent NYMEX prices or differentials or ANS spot 
market prices or differentials.

<R05>
Sec. 206.105  What records must I keep to support my calculations of 
value under this subpart?

    If you determine the value of your oil under this subpart, you must 
retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value.
    (a) You must be able to show:
    (1) How you calculated the value you reported, including all 
adjustments for location, quality, and transportation, and
    (2) How you complied with these rules.
    (b) Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 207 of this 
chapter.
    (c) MMS may review and audit your data, and MMS will direct you to 
use a different value if it determines that the reported value is 
inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 206.106  What are my responsibilities to place production into 
marketable condition and to market production?

    You must place oil in marketable condition and market the oil for 
the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the 
Federal Government. If you use gross proceeds under an arm's-length 
contract in determining value, you must increase those gross proceeds to 
the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain 
services that the seller normally would be responsible to perform to 
place the oil in marketable condition or to market the oil.


<R05>
Sec. 206.107  How do I request a value determination?

    (a) You may request a value determination from MMS regarding any 
Federal lease oil production. Your request must:
    (1) Be in writing;
    (2) Identify specifically all leases involved, the record title or 
operating rights owners of those leases, and the designees for those 
leases;
    (3) Completely explain all relevant facts. You must inform MMS of 
any changes to relevant facts that occur before we respond to your 
request;
    (4) Include copies of all relevant documents;

[[Page 71]]

    (5) Provide your analysis of the issue(s), including citations to 
all relevant precedents (including adverse precedents); and
    (6) Suggest your proposed valuation method.
    (b) MMS will reply to requests expeditiously. MMS may either:
    (1) Issue a value determination signed by the Assistant Secretary, 
Land and Minerals Management; or
    (2) Issue a value determination by MMS; or
    (3) Inform you in writing that MMS will not provide a value 
determination. Situations in which MMS typically will not provide any 
value determination include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Requests for guidance on hypothetical situations; and
    (ii) Matters that are the subject of pending litigation or 
administrative appeals.
    (c)(1) A value determination signed by the Assistant Secretary, Land 
and Minerals Management, is binding on both you and MMS until the 
Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.
    (2) After the Assistant Secretary issues a value determination, you 
must make any adjustments in royalty payments that follow from the 
determination and, if you owe additional royalties, pay late payment 
interest under 30 CFR 218.54.
    (3) A value determination signed by the Assistant Secretary is the 
final action of the Department and is subject to judicial review under 5 
U.S.C. 701-706.
    (d) A value determination issued by MMS is binding on MMS and 
delegated States with respect to the specific situation addressed in the 
determination unless the MMS (for MMS-issued value determinations) or 
the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.
    (1) A value determination by MMS is not an appealable decision or 
order under 30 CFR part 290 subpart B.
    (2) If you receive an order requiring you to pay royalty on the same 
basis as the value determination, you may appeal that order under 30 CFR 
part 290 subpart B.
    (e) In making a value determination, MMS or the Assistant Secretary 
may use any of the applicable valuation criteria in this subpart.
    (f) A change in an applicable statute or regulation on which any 
value determination is based takes precedence over the value 
determination, regardless of whether the MMS or the Assistant Secretary 
modifies or rescinds the value determination.
    (g) The MMS or the Assistant Secretary generally will not 
retroactively modify or rescind a value determination issued under 
paragraph (d) of this section, unless:
    (1) There was a misstatement or omission of material facts; or
    (2) The facts subsequently developed are materially different from 
the facts on which the guidance was based.
    (h) MMS may make requests and replies under this section available 
to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements under Sec. 
206.108.


<R05>
Sec. 206.108  Does MMS protect information I provide?

    Certain information you submit to MMS regarding valuation of oil, 
including transportation allowances, may be exempt from disclosure. To 
the extent applicable laws and regulations permit, MMS will keep 
confidential any data you submit that is privileged, confidential, or 
otherwise exempt from disclosure. All requests for information must be 
submitted under the Freedom of Information Act regulations of the 
Department of the Interior at 43 CFR part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 206.109  When may I take a transportation allowance in determining 
value?

    (a) Transportation allowances permitted when value is based on gross 
proceeds. MMS will allow a deduction for the reasonable, actual costs to 
transport oil from the lease to the point off the lease under Sec. Sec. 
206.110 or 206.111, as applicable. This paragraph applies when:
    (1) You value oil under Sec. 206.102 based on gross proceeds from a 
sale at a point off the lease, unit, or communitized area where the oil 
is produced, and
    (2) The movement to the sales point is not gathering.
    (b) Transportation allowances and other adjustments that apply when 
value is based on NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices. If you value oil 
using NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices under

[[Page 72]]

Sec. 206.103, MMS will allow an adjustment for certain location and 
quality differentials and certain costs associated with transporting oil 
as provided under Sec. 206.112.
    (c) Limits on transportation allowances. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, your transportation allowance may not 
exceed 50 percent of the value of the oil as determined under Sec. 
206.102 or Sec. 206.103 of this subpart. You may not use transportation 
costs incurred to move a particular volume of production to reduce 
royalties owed on production for which those costs were not incurred.
    (2) You may ask MMS to approve a transportation allowance in excess 
of the limitation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. You must 
demonstrate that the transportation costs incurred were reasonable, 
actual, and necessary. Your application for exception (using Form MMS-
4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) must contain 
all relevant and supporting documentation necessary for MMS to make a 
determination. You may never reduce the royalty value of any production 
to zero.
    (d) Allocation of transportation costs. You must allocate 
transportation costs among all products produced and transported as 
provided in Sec. Sec. 206.110 and 206.111. You must express 
transportation allowances for oil as dollars per barrel.
    (e) Liability for additional payments. If MMS determines that you 
took an excessive transportation allowance, then you must pay any 
additional royalties due, plus interest under 30 CFR 218.54. You also 
could be entitled to a credit with interest under applicable rules if 
you understated your transportation allowance. If you take a deduction 
for transportation on Form MMS-2014 by improperly netting the allowance 
against the sales value of the oil instead of reporting the allowance as 
a separate entry, MMS may assess you an amount under Sec. 206.116.

[65 FR 14088, Mar. 15, 2000, as amended at 69 FR 24976, May 5, 2004]


<R05>
Sec. 206.110  How do I determine a transportation allowance under an 
arm's-length transportation contract?

    (a) If you or your affiliate incur transportation costs under an 
arm's-length transportation contract, you may claim a transportation 
allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred as more fully 
explained in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section and subject to the 
limitation in Sec. 206.109(c). You must be able to demonstrate that 
your or your affiliate's contract is at arm's length. You do not need 
MMS approval before reporting a transportation allowance for costs 
incurred under an arm's-length transportation contract.
    (1) If MMS determines that the contract reflects more than the 
consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from 
you or your affiliate to the transporter for the transportation, MMS may 
require that you calculate the transportation allowance under Sec. 
206.111.
    (2) You must calculate the transportation allowance under Sec. 
206.111 if MMS determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-
length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of 
the transportation due to either:
    (i) Misconduct by or between the parties to the arm's-length 
contract; or
    (ii) Breach of your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of 
yourself and the lessor.
    (A) MMS will not use this provision to simply substitute its 
judgment of the reasonable oil transportation costs incurred by you or 
your affiliate under an arm's-length transportation contract.
    (B) The fact that the cost you or your affiliate incur in an arm's 
length transaction is higher than other measures of transportation 
costs, such as rates paid by others in the field or area, is 
insufficient to establish breach of the duty to market unless MMS finds 
additional evidence that you or your affiliate acted unreasonably or in 
bad faith in transporting oil from the lease.
    (b) You may deduct any of the following actual costs you (including 
your affiliates) incur for transporting oil.

[[Page 73]]

You may not use as a deduction any cost that duplicates all or part of 
any other cost that you use under this paragraph.
    (1) The amount that you pay under your arm's-length transportation 
contract or tariff.
    (2) Fees paid (either in volume or in value) for actual or 
theoretical line losses.
    (3) Fees paid for administration of a quality bank.
    (4) The cost of carrying on your books as inventory a volume of oil 
that the pipeline operator requires you to maintain, and that you do 
maintain, in the line as line fill. You must calculate this cost as 
follows:
    (i) Multiply the volume that the pipeline requires you to maintain, 
and that you do maintain, in the pipeline by the value of that volume 
for the current month calculated under Sec. 206.102 or Sec.  206.103, 
as applicable; and
    (ii) Multiply the value calculated under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this 
section by the monthly rate of return, calculated by dividing the rate 
of return specified in Sec. 206.111(i)(2) by 12.
    (5) Fees paid to a terminal operator for loading and unloading of 
crude oil into or from a vessel, vehicle, pipeline, or other conveyance.
    (6) Fees paid for short-term storage (30 days or less) incidental to 
transportation as required by a transporter.
    (7) Fees paid to pump oil to another carrier's system or vehicles as 
required under a tariff.
    (8) Transfer fees paid to a hub operator associated with physical 
movement of crude oil through the hub when you do not sell the oil at 
the hub. These fees do not include title transfer fees.
    (9) Payments for a volumetric deduction to cover shrinkage when 
high-gravity petroleum (generally in excess of 51 degrees API) is mixed 
with lower-gravity crude oil for transportation.
    (10) Costs of securing a letter of credit, or other surety, that the 
pipeline requires you as a shipper to maintain.
    (c) You may not deduct any costs that are not actual costs of 
transporting oil, including but not limited to the following:
    (1) Fees paid for long-term storage (more than 30 days).
    (2) Administrative, handling, and accounting fees associated with 
terminalling.
    (3) Title and terminal transfer fees.
    (4) Fees paid to track and match receipts and deliveries at a market 
center or to avoid paying title transfer fees.
    (5) Fees paid to brokers.
    (6) Fees paid to a scheduling service provider.
    (7) Internal costs, including salaries and related costs, rent/space 
costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to schedule, 
nominate, and account for sale or movement of production.
    (8) Gauging fees.
    (d) If your arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one liquid product, and the transportation costs attributable to each 
product cannot be determined from the contract, then you must allocate 
the total transportation costs to each of the liquid products 
transported.
    (1) Your allocation must use the same proportion as the ratio of the 
volume of each product (excluding waste products with no value) to the 
volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products with no value).
    (2) You may not claim an allowance for the costs of transporting 
lease production that is not royalty-bearing.
    (3) You may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of 
the values of the products transported. MMS will approve the method 
unless it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this 
subpart.
    (e) If your arm's-length transportation contract includes both 
gaseous and liquid products, and the transportation costs attributable 
to each product cannot be determined from the contract, then you must 
propose an allocation procedure to MMS.
    (1) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a 
transportation allowance until MMS accepts or rejects your cost 
allocation. If MMS rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your 
Form MMS-2014 for the months that you used the rejected method and pay 
any additional royalty and interest due.
    (2) You must submit your initial proposal, including all available 
data,

[[Page 74]]

within 3 months after first claiming the allocated deductions on Form 
MMS-2014.
    (f) If your payments for transportation under an arm's-length 
contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever 
consideration is paid to a dollar-value equivalent.
    (g) If your arm's-length sales contract includes a provision 
reducing the contract price by a transportation factor, do not 
separately report the transportation factor as a transportation 
allowance on Form MMS-2014.
    (1) You may use the transportation factor in determining your gross 
proceeds for the sale of the product.
    (2) You must obtain MMS approval before claiming a transportation 
factor in excess of 50 percent of the base price of the product.

Sec. 206.111  How do I determine a transportation allowance if I do 
not have an arm's-length transportation contract or arm's-length tariff?

    (a) This section applies if you or your affiliate do not have an 
arm's-length transportation contract, including situations where you or 
your affiliate provide your own transportation services. Calculate your 
transportation allowance based on your or your affiliate's reasonable, 
actual costs for transportation during the reporting period using the 
procedures prescribed in this section.
    (b) Your or your affiliate's actual costs include the following:
    (1) Operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (d) and (e) 
of this section;
    (2) Overhead under paragraph (f) of this section;
    (3) Depreciation under paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section;
    (4) A return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraph (i) 
of this section; and
    (5) Once the transportation system has been depreciated below ten 
percent of total capital investment, a return on ten percent of total 
capital investment under paragraph (j) of this section.
    (6) To the extent not included in costs identified in paragraphs (d) 
through (j) of this section, you may also deduct the following actual 
costs. You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or 
part of any other cost that you use under this section:
    (i) Volumetric adjustments for actual (not theoretical) line losses.
    (ii) The cost of carrying on your books as inventory a volume of oil 
that the pipeline operator requires you as a shipper to maintain, and 
that you do maintain, in the line as line fill. You must calculate this 
cost as follows:
    (A) Multiply the volume that the pipeline requires you to maintain, 
and that you do maintain, in the pipeline by the value of that volume 
for the current month calculated under Sec. 206.102 or Sec.  206.103, 
as applicable; and
    (B) Multiply the value calculated under paragraph (b)(6)(ii)(A) of 
this section by the monthly rate of return, calculated by dividing the 
rate of return specified in Sec. 206.111(i)(2) by 12.
    (iii) Fees paid to a non-affiliated terminal operator for loading 
and unloading of crude oil into or from a vessel, vehicle, pipeline, or 
other conveyance.
    (iv) Transfer fees paid to a hub operator associated with physical 
movement of crude oil through the hub when you do not sell the oil at 
the hub. These fees do not include title transfer fees.
    (v) A volumetric deduction to cover shrinkage when high-gravity 
petroleum (generally in excess of 51 degrees API) is mixed with lower-
gravity crude oil for transportation.
    (vi) Fees paid to a non-affiliated quality bank administrator for 
administration of a quality bank.
    (7) You may not deduct any costs that are not actual costs of 
transporting oil, including but not limited to the following:
    (i) Fees paid for long-term storage (more than 30 days).
    (ii) Administrative, handling, and accounting fees associated with 
terminalling.
    (iii) Title and terminal transfer fees.
    (iv) Fees paid to track and match receipts and deliveries at a 
market center or to avoid paying title transfer fees.
    (v) Fees paid to brokers.
    (vi) Fees paid to a scheduling service provider.

[[Page 75]]

    (vii) Internal costs, including salaries and related costs, rent/
space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to 
schedule, nominate, and account for sale or movement of production.
    (viii) Theoretical line losses.
    (ix) Gauging fees.
    (c) Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable 
fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment) which are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (d) Allowable operating expenses include:
    (i) Operations supervision and engineering;
    (ii) Operations labor;
    (iii) Fuel;
    (iv) Utilities;
    (v) Materials;
    (vi) Ad valorem property taxes;
    (vii) Rent;
    (viii) Supplies; and
    (ix) Any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense 
which you can document.
    (e) Allowable maintenance expenses include:
    (i) Maintenance of the transportation system;
    (ii) Maintenance of equipment;
    (iii) Maintenance labor; and
    (iv) Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses 
which you can document.
    (f) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. 
State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, 
including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (g) To compute depreciation, you may elect to use either a straight-
line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life 
of the reserves which the transportation system services, or a unit-of-
production method. After you make an election, you may not change 
methods without MMS approval. You may not depreciate equipment below a 
reasonable salvage value.
    (h) This paragraph describes the basis for your depreciation 
schedule.
    (1) If you or your affiliate own a transportation system on June 1, 
2000, you must base your depreciation schedule used in calculating 
actual transportation costs for production after June 1, 2000, on your 
total capital investment in the system (including your original purchase 
price or construction cost and subsequent reinvestment).
    (2) If you or your affiliate purchased the transportation system at 
arm's length before June 1, 2000, you must incorporate depreciation on 
the schedule based on your purchase price (and subsequent reinvestment) 
into your transportation allowance calculations for production after 
June 1, 2000, beginning at the point on the depreciation schedule 
corresponding to that date. You must prorate your depreciation for 
calendar year 2000 by claiming part-year depreciation for the period 
from June 1, 2000 until December 31, 2000. You may not adjust your 
transportation costs for production before June 1, 2000, using the 
depreciation schedule based on your purchase price.
    (3) If you are the original owner of the transportation system on 
June 1, 2000, or if you purchased your transportation system before 
March 1, 1988, you must continue to use your existing depreciation 
schedule in calculating actual transportation costs for production in 
periods after June 1, 2000.
    (4) If you or your affiliate purchase a transportation system at 
arm's length from the original owner after June 1, 2000, you must base 
your depreciation schedule used in calculating actual transportation 
costs on your total capital investment in the system (including your 
original purchase price and subsequent reinvestment). You must prorate 
your depreciation for the year in which you or your affiliate purchased 
the system to reflect the portion of that year for which you or your 
affiliate own the system.
    (5) If you or your affiliate purchase a transportation system at 
arm's length after June 1, 2000, from anyone other than the original 
owner, you must assume the depreciation schedule of the person from whom 
you bought the system. Include in the depreciation schedule any 
subsequent reinvestment.
    (i)(1) To calculate a return on undepreciated capital investment, 
multiply the remaining undepreciated capital balance as of the beginning 
of the

[[Page 76]]

period for which you are calculating the transportation allowance by the 
rate of return provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
    (2) The rate of return is 1.3 times the industrial bond yield index 
for Standard & Poor's BBB bond rating. Use the monthly average rate 
published in ``Standard & Poor's Bond Guide'' for the first month of the 
reporting period for which the allowance applies. Calculate the rate at 
the beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting 
period.
    (j)(1) After a transportation system has been depreciated at or 
below a value equal to ten percent of your total capital investment, you 
may continue to include in the allowance calculation a cost equal to ten 
percent of your total capital investment in the transportation system 
multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
    (2) You may apply this paragraph to a transportation system that 
before June 1, 2000, was depreciated at or below a value equal to ten 
percent of your total capital investment.
    (k) Calculate the deduction for transportation costs based on your 
or your affiliate's cost of transporting each product through each 
individual transportation system. Where more than one liquid product is 
transported, allocate costs consistently and equitably to each of the 
liquid products transported. Your allocation must use the same 
proportion as the ratio of the volume of each liquid product (excluding 
waste products with no value) to the volume of all liquid products 
(excluding waste products with no value).
    (1) You may not take an allowance for transporting lease production 
that is not royalty-bearing.
    (2) You may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of 
the values of the products transported. MMS will approve the method if 
it is consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this subpart.
    (l)(1) Where you transport both gaseous and liquid products through 
the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation 
procedure to MMS.
    (2) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a 
transportation allowance until MMS accepts or rejects your cost 
allocation. If MMS rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your 
Form MMS-2014 for the months that you used the rejected method and pay 
any additional royalty and interest due.
    (3) You must submit your initial proposal, including all available 
data, within 3 months after first claiming the allocated deductions on 
Form MMS-2014.

<R05>
Sec. 206.112  What adjustments and transportation allowances apply when 
I value oil production from my lease using NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices?

    This section applies when you use NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices to 
calculate the value of production under Sec. 206.103. As specified in 
this section, adjust the NYMEX price to reflect the difference in value 
between your lease and Cushing, Oklahoma, or adjust the ANS spot price 
to reflect the difference in value between your lease and the 
appropriate MMS-recognized market center at which the ANS spot price is 
published (for example, Long Beach, California, or San Francisco, 
California). Paragraph (a) of this section explains how you adjust the 
value between the lease and the market center, and paragraph (b) of this 
section explains how you adjust the value between the market center and 
Cushing when you use NYMEX prices. Paragraph (c) of this section 
explains how adjustments may be made for quality differentials that are 
not accounted for through exchange agreements. Paragraph (d) of this 
section gives some examples. References in this section to ``you'' 
include your affiliates as applicable.
    (a) To adjust the value between the lease and the market center:
    (1)(i) For oil that you exchange at arm's length between your lease 
and the market center (or between any intermediate points between those 
locations), you must calculate a lease-to-market center differential by 
the applicable location and quality differentials derived from your 
arm's-length exchange agreement applicable to production during the 
production month.

[[Page 77]]

    (ii) For oil that you exchange between your lease and the market 
center (or between any intermediate points between those locations) 
under an exchange agreement that is not at arm's length, you must obtain 
approval from MMS for a location and quality differential. Until you 
obtain such approval, you may use the location and quality differential 
derived from that exchange agreement applicable to production during the 
production month. If MMS prescribes a different differential, you must 
apply MMS's differential to all periods for which you used your proposed 
differential. You must pay any additional royalties owed resulting from 
using MMS's differential plus late payment interest from the original 
royalty due date, or you may report a credit for any overpaid royalties 
plus interest under 30 U.S.C. 1721(h).
    (2) For oil that you transport between your lease and the market 
center (or between any intermediate points between those locations), you 
may take an allowance for the cost of transporting that oil between the 
relevant points as determined under Sec. 206.110 or Sec.  206.111, as 
applicable.
    (3) If you transport or exchange at arm's length (or both transport 
and exchange) at least 20 percent, but not all, of your oil produced 
from the lease to a market center, determine the adjustment between the 
lease and the market center for the oil that is not transported or 
exchanged (or both transported and exchanged) to or through a market 
center as follows:
    (i) Determine the volume-weighted average of the lease-to-market 
center adjustment calculated under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this 
section for the oil that you do transport or exchange (or both transport 
and exchange) from your lease to a market center.
    (ii) Use that volume-weighted average lease-to-market center 
adjustment as the adjustment for the oil that you do not transport or 
exchange (or both transport and exchange) from your lease to a market 
center.
    (4) If you transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) 
less than 20 percent of the crude oil produced from your lease between 
the lease and a market center, you must propose to MMS an adjustment 
between the lease and the market center for the portion of the oil that 
you do not transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) to a 
market center. Until you obtain such approval, you may use your proposed 
adjustment. If MMS prescribes a different adjustment, you must apply 
MMS's adjustment to all periods for which you used your proposed 
adjustment. You must pay any additional royalties owed resulting from 
using MMS's adjustment plus late payment interest from the original 
royalty due date, or you may report a credit for any overpaid royalties 
plus interest under 30 U.S.C. 1721(h).
    (5) You may not both take a transportation allowance and use a 
location and quality adjustment or exchange differential for the same 
oil between the same points.
    (b) For oil that you value using NYMEX prices, adjust the value 
between the market center and Cushing, Oklahoma, as follows:
    (1) If you have arm's-length exchange agreements between the market 
center and Cushing under which you exchange to Cushing at least 20 
percent of all the oil you own at the market center during the 
production month, you must use the volume-weighted average of the 
location and quality differentials from those agreements as the 
adjustment between the market center and Cushing for all the oil that 
you produce from the leases during that production month for which that 
market center is used.
    (2) If paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply, you must use 
the WTI differential published in an MMS-approved publication for the 
market center nearest your lease, for crude oil most similar in quality 
to your production, as the adjustment between the market center and 
Cushing. (For example, for light sweet crude oil produced offshore of 
Louisiana, use the WTI differential for Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil 
at St. James, Louisiana.) After you select an MMS-approved publication, 
you may not select a different publication more often than once every 2 
years, unless the publication you use is no longer published or MMS 
revokes its approval of the publication. If you

[[Page 78]]

are required to change publications, you must begin a new 2-year period.
    (3) If neither paragraph (b)(1) nor (b)(2) of this section applies, 
you may propose an alternative differential to MMS. Until you obtain 
such approval, you may use your proposed differential. If MMS prescribes 
a different differential, you must apply MMS's differential to all 
periods for which you used your proposed differential. You must pay any 
additional royalties owed resulting from using MMS's differential plus 
late payment interest from the original royalty due date, or you may 
report a credit for any overpaid royalties plus interest under 30 U.S.C. 
1721(h).
    (c)(1) If you adjust for location and quality differentials or for 
transportation costs under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, also 
adjust the NYMEX price or ANS spot price for quality based on premiums 
or penalties determined by pipeline quality bank specifications at 
intermediate commingling points or at the market center if those points 
are downstream of the royalty measurement point approved by MMS or BLM, 
as applicable. Make this adjustment only if and to the extent that such 
adjustments were not already included in the location and quality 
differentials determined from your arm's-length exchange agreements.
    (2) If the quality of your oil as adjusted is still different from 
the quality of the representative crude oil at the market center after 
making the quality adjustments described in paragraphs (a), (b) and 
(c)(1) of this section, you may make further gravity adjustments using 
posted price gravity tables. If quality bank adjustments do not 
incorporate or provide for adjustments for sulfur content, you may make 
sulfur adjustments, based on the quality of the representative crude oil 
at the market center, of 5.0 cents per one-tenth percent difference in 
sulfur content, unless MMS approves a higher adjustment.
    (d) The examples in this paragraph illustrate how to apply the 
requirement of this section.
    (1) Example. Assume that a Federal lessee produces crude oil from a 
lease near Artesia, New Mexico. Further, assume that the lessee 
transports the oil to Roswell, New Mexico, and then exchanges the oil to 
Midland, Texas. Assume the lessee refines the oil received in exchange 
at Midland. Assume that the NYMEX price is $30.00/bbl, adjusted for the 
roll; that the WTI differential (Cushing to Midland) is -$.10/bbl; that 
the lessee's exchange agreement between Roswell and Midland results in a 
location and quality differential of -$.08/bbl; and that the lessee's 
actual cost of transporting the oil from Artesia to Roswell is $.40/bbl. 
In this example, the royalty value of the oil is $30.00-$.10-$.08--$.40 
= $29.42/bbl.
    (2) Example. Assume the same facts as in the example in paragraph 
(1), except that the lessee transports and exchanges to Midland 40 
percent of the production from the lease near Artesia, and transports 
the remaining 60 percent directly to its own refinery in Ohio. In this 
example, the 40 percent of the production would be valued at $29.42/bbl, 
as explained in the previous example. In this example, the other 60 
percent also would be valued at $29.42/bbl.
    (3) Example. Assume that a Federal lessee produces crude oil from a 
lease near Bakersfield, California. Further, assume that the lessee 
transports the oil to Hynes Station, and then exchanges the oil to 
Cushing which it further exchanges with oil it refines. Assume that the 
ANS spot price is $20.00/bbl, and that the lessee's actual cost of 
transporting the oil from Bakersfield to Hynes Station is $.28/bbl. The 
lessee must request approval from MMS for a location and quality 
adjustment between Hynes Station and Long Beach. For example, the lessee 
likely would propose using the tariff on Line 63 from Hynes Station to 
Long Beach as the adjustment between those points. Assume that 
adjustment to be $.72, including the sulfur and gravity bank 
adjustments, and that MMS approves the lessee's request. In this 
example, the preliminary (because the location and quality adjustment is 
subject to MMS review) royalty value of the oil is $20.00-$.72-$.28 = 
$19.00/bbl. The fact that oil was exchanged to Cushing does not change 
use of ANS spot prices for royalty valuation.

Sec. 206.113  How will MMS identify market centers?

    MMS periodically will publish in the Federal Register a list of 
market centers. MMS will monitor market activity and, if necessary, add 
to or modify the list of market centers and will publish such 
modifications in the Federal Register. MMS will consider the following 
factors and conditions in specifying market centers:
    (a) Points where MMS-approved publications publish prices useful for 
index purposes;
    (b) Markets served;
    (c) Input from industry and others knowledgeable in crude oil 
marketing and transportation;
    (d) Simplification; and
    (e) Other relevant matters.


<R05>
Sec. 206.114  What are my reporting requirements under an arm's-length 
transportation contract?

    You or your affiliate must use a separate entry on Form MMS-2014 to 
notify MMS of an allowance based on transportation costs you or your 
affiliate incur. MMS may require you or your affiliate to submit arm's-
length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating 
agreements, and related documents. Recordkeeping requirements are found 
at part 207 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 206.115  What are my reporting requirements under a non-arm's-length 
transportation arrangement?

    (a) You or your affiliate must use a separate entry on Form MMS-2014 
to notify MMS of an allowance based on transportation costs you or your 
affiliate incur.
    (b) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, base your 
initial deduction on estimates of allowable oil transportation costs for 
the applicable period. Use the most recently available operations data 
for the transportation system or, if such data are not available, use 
estimates based on data for similar transportation systems. Section 
206.117 will apply when you amend your report based on your actual 
costs.
    (c) MMS may require you or your affiliate to submit all data used to 
calculate the allowance deduction. Recordkeeping requirements are found 
at part 207 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 206.116  What interest and assessments apply if I improperly report 
a transportation allowance?

    (a) If you or your affiliate net a transportation allowance rather 
than report it as a separate entry against the royalty value on Form 
MMS-2014, you will be assessed an amount up to 10 percent of the netted 
allowance, not to exceed $250 per lease selling arrangement per sales 
period.
    (b) If you or your affiliate deduct a transportation allowance on 
Form MMS-2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the oil 
transported without obtaining MMS's prior approval under Sec. 206.109, 
you must pay interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date 
that amount is taken to the date you or your affiliate file an exception 
request that MMS approves. If you do not file an exception request, or 
if MMS does not approve your request, you must pay interest on the 
excess allowance amount taken from the date that amount is taken until 
the date you pay the additional royalties owed.


<R05>
Sec. 206.117  What reporting adjustments must I make for transportation 
allowances?

    (a) If your or your affiliate's actual transportation allowance is 
less than the amount you claimed on Form MMS-2014 for each month during 
the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties plus 
interest computed under 30 CFR 218.54 from the date you took the 
deduction to the date you repay the difference.
    (b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the 
amount you claimed on Form MMS-2014 for any month during the allowance 
form reporting period, you are entitled to a credit plus interest under 
applicable rules.


<R05>
Sec. 206.119  How are royalty quantity and quality determined?

    (a) Compute royalties based on the quantity and quality of oil as 
measured at the point of settlement approved by BLM for onshore leases 
or MMS for offshore leases.

[[Page 80]]

    (b) If the value of oil determined under this subpart is based upon 
a quantity or quality different from the quantity or quality at the 
point of royalty settlement approved by the BLM for onshore leases or 
MMS for offshore leases, adjust the value for those differences in 
quantity or quality.
    (c) Any actual loss that you may incur before the royalty settlement 
metering or measurement point is not subject to royalty if BLM or MMS, 
as appropriate, determines that the loss is unavoidable.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, royalties 
are due on 100 percent of the volume measured at the approved point of 
royalty settlement. You may not claim a reduction in that measured 
volume for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty settlement 
or for theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken place either 
before or after the approved point of royalty settlement.

Sec. 206.151  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart:
    Affiliate means a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under 
common control with another person. For purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Ownership or common ownership of more than 50 percent of the 
voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of 
ownership, of another person constitutes control. Ownership of less than 
10 percent constitutes a presumption of noncontrol that MMS may rebut.
    (2) If there is ownership or common ownership of 10 through 50 
percent of the voting securities or instruments of ownership, or other 
forms of ownership, of another person, MMS will consider the following 
factors in determining whether there is control under the circumstances 
of a particular case:
    (i) The extent to which there are common officers or directors;
    (ii) With respect to the voting securities, or instruments of 
ownership, or other forms of ownership: The percentage of ownership or 
common ownership, the relative percentage of ownership or common 
ownership compared to the percentage(s) of ownership by other persons, 
whether a person is the greatest single owner, or whether there is an

[[Page 81]]

opposing voting bloc of greater ownership;
    (iii) Operation of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility;

control with another person.
    (3) Regardless of any percentage of ownership or common ownership, 
relatives, either by blood or marriage, are affiliates.
    Allowance means a deduction in determining value for royalty 
purposes. Processing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, 
actual costs of processing gas determined under this subpart. 
Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual 
costs of moving unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products to a 
point of sale or delivery off the lease, unit area, or communitized 
area, or away from a processing plant. The transportation allowance does 
not include gathering costs.
    Area means a geographic region at least as large as the defined 
limits of an oil and/or gas field, in which oil and/or gas lease 
products have similar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement between 
independent persons who are not affiliates and who have opposing 
economic interests regarding that contract. To be considered arm's 
length for any production month, a contract must satisfy this definition 
for that month, as well as when the contract was executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Compression means the process of raising the pressure of gas.
    Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees 
of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to 
processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that 
results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially 
in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface 
oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs 
vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually 
given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil 
and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields 
are located. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) fields are named and their 
boundaries are designated by MMS.
    Gas means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, 
hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and 
which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand 
indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied 
state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.
    Gas plant products means separate marketable elements, compounds, or 
mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from 
processing gas, excluding residue gas.
    Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central 
accumulation and/or treatment point on the lease, unit or communitized 
area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, 
unit or communitized area as approved by BLM or MMS OCS operations 
personnel for onshore and OCS leases, respectively.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the 
disposition of the gas, residue gas, and gas plant products produced. 
Gross proceeds includes, but

[[Page 82]]

is not limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as 
dehydration, measurement, and/or gathering to the extent that the lessee 
is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Federal Government. Tax 
reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even 
though the Federal royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Monies 
and other consideration, including the forms of consideration identified 
in this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally 
entitled but which it does not seek to collect through reasonable 
efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a 
mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or 
extraction of, or removal of lease products--or the land area covered by 
that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lease products means any leased minerals attributable to, 
originating from, or allocated to Outer Continental Shelf or onshore 
Federal leases.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, 
and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or 
other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has 
an interest in a lease as well as an operator or payor who has no 
interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment 
responsibility.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products which have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
    Marketable condition means lease products which are sufficiently 
free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be 
accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or 
area.
    Marketing affiliate means an affiliate of the lessee whose function 
is to acquire only the lessee's production and to market that 
production.
    Minimum royalty means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the 
lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing 
regulations.
    Net-back method (or work-back method) means a method for calculating 
market value of gas at the lease. Under this method, costs of 
transportation, processing, or manufacturing are deducted from the 
proceeds received for the gas, residue gas or gas plant products, and 
any extracted, processed, or manufactured products, or from the value of 
the gas, residue gas or gas plant products, and any extracted, 
processed, or manufactured products, at the first point at which 
reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a sale 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of 
such products, to ascertain value at the lease.
    Net output means the quantity of residue gas and each gas plant 
product that a processing plant produces.
    Net profit share (for applicable Federal leases) means the specified 
share of the net profit from production of oil and gas as provided in 
the agreement.
    Netting is the deduction of an allowance from the sales value by 
reporting a one line net sales value, instead of correctly reporting the 
deduction as a separate line item on the Form MMS-2014.
    Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) means all submerged lands lying 
seaward and outside of the area of land beneath navigable waters as 
defined in section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) and of 
which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are 
subject to its jurisdiction and control.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Posted price means the price, net of all adjustments for quality and 
location, specified in publicly available price bulletins or other price 
notices available as part of normal business operations for quantities 
of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products in marketable 
condition.
    Processing means any process designed to remove elements or 
compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including 
absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally 
take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure

[[Page 83]]

reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and 
compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures 
and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.
    Residue gas means that hydrocarbon gas consisting principally of 
methane resulting from processing gas.
    Section 6 lease means an OCS lease subject to section 6 of the Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1335.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of gas, residue gas and gas plant 
products are made. Selling arrangements are described by illustration in 
the MMS Royalty Management Program Oil and Gas Payor Handbook.
    Spot sales agreement means a contract wherein a seller agrees to 
sell to a buyer a specified amount of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or 
gas plant products at a specified price over a fixed period, usually of 
short duration, which does not normally require a cancellation notice to 
terminate, and which does not contain an obligation, nor imply an 
intent, to continue in subsequent periods.
    Warranty contract means a long-term contract entered into prior to 
1970, including any amendments thereto, for the sale of gas wherein the 
producer agrees to sell a specific amount of gas and the gas delivered 
in satisfaction of this obligation may come from fields or sources 
outside of the designated fields.

Sec. 206.152  Valuation standards--unprocessed gas.

    (a)(1) This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is not 
processed and all gas that is processed but is sold or otherwise 
disposed of by the lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract prior to 
processing (including all gas where the lessee's arm's-length contract 
for the sale of that gas prior to processing provides for the value to 
be determined on the basis of a percentage of the purchaser's proceeds 
resulting from processing the gas). This section also applies to 
processed gas that must be valued prior to processing in accordance with 
Sec. 206.155 of this part. Where the lessee's contract includes a 
reservation of the right to process the gas and the lessee exercises 
that right, Sec. 206.153 of this part shall apply instead of this 
section.
    (2) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of gas subject to 
this subpart shall be the value of gas determined under this section 
less applicable allowances.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of gas sold under an arm's-length contract is 
the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. The lessee shall 
have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The 
value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, is subject to 
monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this section, gas which 
is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and 
then sold by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon 
the sale by the marketing affiliate. Also, where the lessee's arm's-
length contract for the sale of gas prior to processing provides for the 
value to be determined based upon a percentage of the purchaser's 
proceeds resulting from processing the gas, the value of production, for 
royalty purposes, shall never be less than a value equivalent to 100 
percent of the value of the residue gas attributable to the processing 
of the lessee's gas.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the gas. If the 
contract does not reflect the total consideration, then the MMS may 
require that the gas sold pursuant to that contract be valued in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the additional 
consideration.
    (iii) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of

[[Page 84]]

the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the 
lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and 
the lessor, then MMS shall require that the gas production be valued 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and in 
accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this 
section. When MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS 
will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's value.
    (iv) How to value over-delivered volumes under a cash-out program. 
This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from 
a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation 
contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price 
the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for 
over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same 
value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those 
volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract. 
However, if MMS determines that the price specified in the 
transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low, 
the lessee must value all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2) 
or (c)(3) of this section.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the value of gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract shall be 
determined by MMS, and due consideration will be given to all valuation 
criteria specified in this section. The lessee must request a value 
determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section for gas 
sold pursuant to a warranty contract; provided, however, that any value 
determination for a warranty contract in effect on the effective date of 
these regulations shall remain in effect until modified by MMS.
    (3) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the gas.
    (c) The value of gas subject to this section which is not sold 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable value 
determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following 
methods:
    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition other than by 
an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are 
equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable 
arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other dispositions of 
like-quality gas in the same field (or, if necessary to obtain a 
reasonable sample, from the same area). In evaluating the comparability 
of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the 
following factors shall be considered: price, time of execution, 
duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of gas, volume, and 
such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the 
gas;
    (2) A value determined by consideration of other information 
relevant in valuing like-quality gas, including gross proceeds under 
arm's-length contracts for like-quality gas in the same field or nearby 
fields or areas, posted prices for gas, prices received in arm's-length 
spot sales of gas, other reliable public sources of price or market 
information, and other information as to the particular lease operation 
or the saleability of the gas; or
    (3) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except 
paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal 
law at which gas may be sold is less than the value determined pursuant 
to this section, then MMS shall accept such maximum price as the value. 
For purposes of this section, price limitations set by any State or 
local government shall not be considered as a maximum price permitted by 
Federal law.
    (2) The limitation prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall not apply to gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract and valued 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the lessee shall retain all data

[[Page 85]]

relevant to the determination of royalty value. Such data shall be 
subject to review and audit, and MMS will direct a lessee to use a 
different value if it determines that the reported value is inconsistent 
with the requirements of these regulations.
    (2) Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or State representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Interior, or other person authorized to 
receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for like-
quality production sold, purchased or otherwise obtained by the lessee 
from the field or area or from nearby fields or areas.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to the MMS Associate Director for Minerals Revenue Management or 
his/her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be 
used and contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. 
The notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification 
due no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee 
first reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method 
authorized by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and each time 
there is a change in a method under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54. 
If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for 
the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based 
upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. In making a value determination MMS may use any of the 
valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That determination shall 
remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues its 
determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease production, 
less applicable allowances.
    (i) The lessee must place gas in marketable condition and market the 
gas for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to 
the Federal Government. Where the value established under this section 
is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value will be increased 
to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the 
purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services the cost 
of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the gas 
in marketable condition or to market the gas.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. If there 
is no contract revision or amendment, and the lessee fails to take 
proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is 
entitled, it must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable 
price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing 
and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee 
makes timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under 
its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable 
measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the 
lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or 
consideration resulting from the price increase or additional benefits 
are received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee 
to avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser 
fails to

[[Page 86]]

pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of gas.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Federal Government 
or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation or extraordinary cost allowances, is 
exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 
Sec. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this 
subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR 
part 2.

<R05>
Sec. 206.153  Valuation standards--processed gas.

    (a)(1) This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is 
processed by the lessee and any other gas production to which this 
subpart applies and that is not subject to the valuation provisions of 
Sec. 206.152 of this part. This section applies where the lessee's 
contract includes a reservation of the right to process the gas and the 
lessee exercises that right.
    (2) The value of production, for royalty purposes, of gas subject to 
this section shall be the combined value of the residue gas and all gas 
plant products determined pursuant to this section, plus the value of 
any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement 
without resorting to processing determined pursuant to Sec. 206.102 of 
this part, less applicable transportation allowances and processing 
allowances determined pursuant to this subpart.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of residue gas or any gas plant product sold 
under an arm's-length contract is the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of 
this section, residue gas or any gas plant product which is sold or 
otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and then sold 
by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be 
valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon the sale by the 
marketing affiliate.
    (ii) In conducting these reviews and audits, MMS will examine 
whether or not the contract reflects the total consideration actually 
transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller 
for the residue gas or gas plant product. If the contract does not 
reflect the total consideration, then the MMS may require that the 
residue gas or gas plant product sold pursuant to that contract be 
valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not 
be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the 
additional consideration.
    (iii) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the residue gas or gas plant product because of 
misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee 
otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production 
for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall 
require that the residue gas or gas plant product be valued pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and in accordance with the 
notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's value.
    (iv) How to value over-delivered volumes under a cash-out program. 
This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from 
a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation 
contract. For all over-

[[Page 87]]

delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price the pipeline is 
required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for over-delivery 
specified in the transportation contract. Use the same value for volumes 
that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those volumes are 
subject to a lower price under the transportation contract. However, if 
MMS determines that the price specified in the transportation contract 
for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low, the lessee must value 
all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the value of residue gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract 
shall be determined by MMS, and due consideration will be given to all 
valuation criteria specified in this section. The lessee must request a 
value determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section for 
gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract; provided, however, that any 
value determination for a warranty contract in effect on the effective 
date of these regulations shall remain in effect until modified by MMS.
    (3) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the residue gas or gas plant 
product.
    (c) The value of residue gas or any gas plant product which is not 
sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable value 
determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following 
methods:
    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition other than by 
an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are 
equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable 
arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other dispositions of 
like quality residue gas or gas plant products from the same processing 
plant (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from nearby 
plants). In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for 
the purposes of these regulations, the following factors shall be 
considered: price, time of execution, duration, market or markets 
served, terms, quality of residue gas or gas plant products, volume, and 
such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the 
residue gas or gas plant products;
    (2) A value determined by consideration of other information 
relevant in valuing like-quality residue gas or gas plant products, 
including gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts for like-quality 
residue gas or gas plant products from the same gas plant or other 
nearby processing plants, posted prices for residue gas or gas plant 
products, prices received in spot sales of residue gas or gas plant 
products, other reliable public sources of price or market information, 
and other information as to the particular lease operation or the 
saleability of such residue gas or gas plant products; or
    (3) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value.
    (d)(1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except 
paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal 
law at which any residue gas or gas plant products may be sold is less 
than the value determined pursuant to this section, then MMS shall 
accept such maximum price as the value. For the purposes of this 
section, price limitations set by any State or local government shall 
not be considered as a maximum price permitted by Federal law.
    (2) The limitation prescribed by paragraph (d)(1) of this section 
shall not apply to residue gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract and 
valued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (e)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the 
determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and 
audit, and MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it 
determines upon review or audit that the reported value is inconsistent 
with the requirements of these regulations.
    (2) Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or State representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department of the Interior, or other persons authorized 
to receive such information, arm's-length sales

[[Page 88]]

and volume data for like-quality residue gas and gas plant products 
sold, purchased or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the same 
processing plant or from nearby processing plants.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined any value 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section. The notification 
shall be by letter to the MMS Associate Director for Minerals Revenue 
Management or his/her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation 
method to be used and contain a brief description of the procedure to be 
followed. The notification required by this paragraph is a one-time 
notification due no later than the end of the month following the month 
the lessee first reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation 
method authorized by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and 
each time there is a change in a method under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) 
of this section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest computed on that difference pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54. 
If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions for 
the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based 
upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. In making a value determination, MMS may use any of the 
valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That determination shall 
remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues its 
determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for residue gas and/or 
any gas plant products, less applicable transportation allowances and 
processing allowances determined pursuant to this subpart.
    (i) The lessee must place residue gas and gas plant products in 
marketable condition and market the residue gas and gas plant products 
for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the 
Federal Government. Where the value established under this section is 
determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value will be increased to 
the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the 
purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services the cost 
of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the 
residue gas or gas plant products in marketable condition or to market 
the residue gas and gas plant products.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee makes timely 
application for a price increase or benefit allowed under its contract 
but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable measures, 
which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe 
no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration 
resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. 
This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its 
royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, 
in whole or in part, or timely, for a quantity of residue gas or gas 
plant product.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or

binding against the Federal Government or its beneficiaries until the 
audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation allowances, processing allowances or 
extraordinary cost allowances, is exempted from disclosure by the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data 
specified by law to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, 
will be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. All requests for information about 
determinations made under this part are to be submitted in accordance 
with the Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department of the 
Interior, 43 CFR part 2.

Sec. 206.154  Determination of quantities and qualities for computing 
royalties.

    (a)(1) Royalties shall be computed on the basis of the quantity and 
quality of unprocessed gas at the point of royalty settlement approved 
by BLM or MMS for onshore and OCS leases, respectively.
    (2) If the value of gas determined pursuant to Sec. 206.152 of this 
subpart is based upon a quantity and/or quality that is different from 
the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement, as 
approved by BLM or MMS, that value shall be adjusted for the differences 
in quantity and/or quality.
    (b)(1) For residue gas and gas plant products, the quantity basis 
for computing royalties due is the monthly net output of the plant even 
though residue gas and/or gas plant products may be in temporary 
storage.
    (2) If the value of residue gas and/or gas plant products determined 
pursuant to Sec. 206.153 of this subpart is based upon a quantity and/
or quality of residue gas and/or gas plant products that is different 
from that which is attributable to a lease, determined in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section, that value shall be adjusted for the 
differences in quantity and/or quality.
    (c) The quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products 
attributable to a lease shall be determined according to the following 
procedure:
    (1) When the net output of the processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from only one lease, the quantity of the residue gas and gas 
plant products on which computations of royalty are based is the net 
output of the plant.
    (2) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from more than one lease producing gas of uniform content, the 
quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each 
lease shall be in the same proportions as the ratios obtained by 
dividing the amount of gas delivered to the plant from each lease by the 
total amount of gas delivered from all leases.
    (3) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from more than one lease producing gas of nonuniform content, 
the quantity of the residue gas allocable to each lease will be 
determined by multiplying the amount of gas delivered to the plant from 
the lease by the residue gas content of the gas, and dividing the 
arithmetical product thus obtained by the sum of the similar 
arithmetical products separately obtained for all leases from which gas 
is delivered to the plant, and then multiplying the net output of the 
residue gas by the arithmetic quotient obtained. The net output of gas 
plant products allocable to each lease will be determined by multiplying 
the amount of gas delivered to the plant from the lease by the gas plant 
product content of the gas, and dividing the arithmetical product thus 
obtained by the sum of the similar arithmetical products separately 
obtained for all leases from which gas is delivered to the plant, and 
then multiplying the net output of each gas plant product by the 
arithmetic quotient obtained.
    (4) A lessee may request MMS approval of other methods for 
determining the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable 
to each lease. If approved, such method will be applicable to all gas 
production from Federal leases that is processed in the same plant.

[[Page 90]]

    (d)(1) No deductions may be made from the royalty volume or royalty 
value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed 
gas that may be sustained prior to the royalty settlement metering or 
measurement point will not be subject to royalty provided that such loss 
is determined to have been unavoidable by BLM or MMS, as appropriate.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and 30 
CFR 202.151(c), royalties are due on 100 percent of the volume 
determined in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section. There can be no reduction in that determined volume for actual 
losses after the quantity basis has been determined or for theoretical 
losses that are claimed to have taken place. Royalties are due on 100 
percent of the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas 
plant products as provided in this subpart, less applicable allowances. 
There can be no deduction from the value of the unprocessed gas, residue 
gas, and/or gas plant products to compensate for actual losses after the 
quantity basis has been determined, or for theoretical losses that are 
claimed to have taken place.

Sec. 206.155  Accounting for comparison.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where the 
lessee (or a person to whom the lessee has transferred gas pursuant to a 
non-arm's-length contract or without a contract) processes the lessee's 
gas and after processing the gas the residue gas is not sold pursuant to 
an arm's-length contract, the value, for royalty purposes, shall be the 
greater of (1) the combined value, for royalty purposes, of the residue 
gas and gas plant products resulting from processing the gas determined 
pursuant to Sec. 206.153 of this subpart, plus the value, for royalty 
purposes, of any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty 
settlement without resorting to processing determined pursuant to Sec. 
206.102 of this subpart; or (2) the value, for royalty purposes, of the 
gas prior to processing determined in accordance with Sec. 206.152 of 
this subpart.
    (b) The requirement for accounting for comparison contained in the 
terms of leases will govern as provided in Sec. 206.150(b) of this 
subpart. When accounting for comparison is required by the lease terms, 
such accounting for comparison shall be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 206.156  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of gas has been determined pursuant to Sec. 
206.152 or Sec. 206.153 of this subpart at a point (e.g., sales point 
or point of value determination) off the lease, MMS shall allow a 
deduction for the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee to 
transport unprocessed gas, residue gas, and gas plant products from a 
lease to a point off the lease including, if appropriate, transportation 
from the lease to a gas processing plant off the lease and from the 
plant to a point away from the plant.
    (b) Transportation costs must be allocated among all products 
produced and transported as provided in Sec. 206.157.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for 
unprocessed gas valued in accordance with Sec. 206.152 of this subpart, 
the transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling 
arrangement shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the unprocessed 
gas determined in accordance with Sec. 206.152 of this subpart.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, for gas 
production valued in accordance with Sec. 206.153 of this subpart the 
transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a selling arrangement 
shall not exceed 50 percent of the value of the residue gas or gas plant 
product determined in accordance with Sec. 206.153 of this subpart. For 
purposes of this section, natural gas liquids shall be considered one 
product.
    (3) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a transportation 
allowance deduction in excess of the limitations prescribed by 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. The lessee must 
demonstrate that the transportation costs incurred in excess of the

[[Page 91]]

limitations prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section 
were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for exception 
(using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) 
shall contain all relevant and supporting documentation necessary for 
MMS to make a determination. Under no circumstances shall the value for 
royalty purposes under any selling arrangement be reduced to zero.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
subpart, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest, determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest. If the lessee takes a deduction 
for transportation on the Form MMS-2014 by improperly netting the 
allowance against the sales value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, 
and gas plant products instead of reporting the allowance as a separate 
line item, he may be assessed an additional amount under 206.157(d).

[53 FR 1272, Jan. 15, 1988, as amended at 61 FR 5465, Feb. 12, 1996; 64 
FR 43288, Aug. 10, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 206.157  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length transportation contracts. (1)(i) For transportation 
costs incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the 
transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred 
by the lessee for transporting the unprocessed gas, residue gas and/or 
gas plant products under that contract, except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, subject to monitoring, 
review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall have the burden of 
demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. MMS' prior approval is 
not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-
length contract. Such allowances shall be subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (f) of this section. The lessee must claim a transportation 
allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether or 
not the contract reflects more than the consideration actually 
transferred either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the 
transporter for the transportation. If the contract reflects more than 
the total consideration, then the MMS may require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section.
    (iii) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to 
an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable 
value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (2)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one product in a gaseous phase and the transportation costs attributable 
to each product cannot be determined from the contract, the total 
transportation costs shall be allocated in a consistent and equitable 
manner to each of the products transported in the same proportion as the 
ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products which have 
no value) to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding 
waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this 
paragraph, no allowance may be taken for the costs of transporting lease 
production which is not royalty bearing without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (i), the lessee 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of the values 
of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method unless it 
determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (3) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous 
and liquid products and the transportation

[[Page 92]]

costs attributable to each cannot be determined from the contract, the 
lessee shall propose an allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use 
the transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed 
allocation procedure until MMS issues its determination on the 
acceptability of the cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all 
relevant data to support its proposal. MMS shall then determine the gas 
transportation allowance based upon the lessee's proposal and any 
additional information MMS deems necessary. The lessee must submit the 
allocation proposal within 3 months of claiming the allocated deduction 
on the Form MMS-2014.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not based on a dollar per unit, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for 
the purposes of this section.
    (5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price or a posted price 
includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a 
transportation factor, MMS will not consider the transportation factor 
to be a transportation allowance. The transportation factor may be used 
in determining the lessee's gross proceeds for the sale of the product. 
The transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of 
the product without MMS approval.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, 
the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable 
actual costs as provided in this paragraph. All transportation 
allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation 
are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee 
must claim a transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-2014. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may 
direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation 
allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial 
depreciable investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate 
of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed 
assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment) which are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. 
State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, 
including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. After a lessee has elected to use either method for 
a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the 
other alternative without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, or a 
unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not 
change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance

[[Page 93]]

calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportation 
system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be 
depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by 
the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this 
section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This 
alternative shall apply only to transportation facilities first placed 
in service after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return must be 1.3 times the industrial rate 
associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating. The BBB rate must be the 
monthly average rate as published in Standard & Poor's Bond Guide for 
the first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3)(i) The deduction for transportation costs shall be determined on 
the basis of the lessee's cost of transporting each product through each 
individual transportation system. Where more than one product in a 
gaseous phase is transported, the allocation of costs to each of the 
products transported shall be made in a consistent and equitable manner 
in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product 
(excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all 
products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products which have no 
value). Except as provided in this paragraph, the lessee may not take an 
allowance for transporting a product which is not royalty bearing 
without MMS approval.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i), the 
lessee may propose to the MMS a cost allocation method on the basis of 
the values of the products transported. MMS shall approve the method 
unless it determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (4) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through 
the same transportation system, the lessee shall propose a cost 
allocation procedure to MMS. The lessee may use the transportation 
allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation 
procedure until MMS issues its determination on the acceptability of the 
cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all relevant data to support 
its proposal. MMS shall then determine the transportation allowance 
based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS 
deems necessary. The lessee must submit the allocation proposal within 3 
months of claiming the allocated deduction on the Form MMS-2014.
    (5) You may apply for an exception from the requirement to compute 
actual costs under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section.
    (i) The MMS will grant the exception if:
    (A) The transportation system has a tariff filed with the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or a state regulatory agency, that 
FERC or the state regulatory agency has permitted to become effective, 
and
    (B) Third parties are paying prices, including discounted prices, 
under the tariff to transport gas on the system under arm's-length 
transportation contracts.
    (ii) If MMS approves the exception, you must calculate your 
transportation allowance for each production month based on the lesser 
of the volume-weighted average of the rates paid by the third parties 
under arm's-length transportation contracts during that production month 
or the non-arm's-length payment by the lessee to the pipeline.
    (iii) If during any production month there are no prices paid under 
the tariff by third parties to transport gas on the system under arm's-
length transportation contracts, you may use the volume-weighted average 
of the rates paid by third parties under arm's-length transportation 
contracts in the most recent preceding production month in which the 
tariff remains in effect and third parties paid such rates, for up to 
five successive production months. You must use the non-arm's-length 
payment by the lessee to the pipeline if it is less than the volume-
weighted average of the rates paid by third parties under arm's-length 
contracts.

[[Page 94]]

    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) You must 
use a separate entry on Form MMS-2014 to notify MMS of a transportation 
allowance.
    (ii) The MMS may require you to submit arm's-length transportation 
contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related 
documents. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 207 of this 
chapter.
    (iii) You may not use a transportation allowance that was in effect 
before March 1, 1988. You must use the provisions of this subpart to 
determine your transportation allowance.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) You must use a separate 
entry on Form MMS-2014 to notify MMS of a transportation allowance.
    (ii) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, base your 
initial deduction on estimates of allowable gas transportation costs for 
the applicable period. Use the most recently available operations data 
for the transportation system or, if such data are not available, use 
estimates based on data for similar transportation systems. Paragraph 
(e) of this section will apply when you amend your report based on your 
actual costs.
    (iii) The MMS may require you to submit all data used to calculate 
the allowance deduction. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 
207 of this chapter.
    (iv) If you are authorized under paragraph (b)(5) of this section to 
use an exception to the requirement to calculate your actual 
transportation costs, you must follow the reporting requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (v) You may not use a transportation allowance that was in effect 
before March 1, 1988. You must use the provisions of this subpart to 
determine your transportation allowance.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a transportation 
allowance against the royalty value on the Form MMS-2014, the lessee 
shall be assessed an amount of up to 10 percent of the allowance netted 
not to exceed $250 per lease selling arrangement per sales period.
    (2) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its Form MMS-
2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the gas transported without 
obtaining prior approval of MMS under Sec. 206.156, the lessee shall 
pay interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date such 
amount is taken to the date the lessee files an exception request with 
MMS.
    (3) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (4) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month 
during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be required to 
pay additional royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.54 
from the allowance reporting period when the lessee took the deduction 
to the date the lessee repays the difference to MMS. If the actual 
transportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken 
on Form MMS-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, 
the lessee shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (2) For lessees transporting production from onshore Federal leases, 
the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual 
costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (3) For lessees transporting gas production from leases on the OCS, 
if the lessee's estimated transportation allowance exceeds the allowance 
based on actual costs, the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 
to reflect actual costs, together with its payment, in accordance with 
instructions provided by MMS. If the lessee's estimated transportation 
allowance is less than the allowance based on actual costs, the refund 
procedure will be specified by MMS.
    (f) Allowable costs in determining transportation allowances. You 
may include, but are not limited to (subject to the requirements of 
paragraph (g) of this section), the following costs in determining the 
arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of

[[Page 95]]

this section or the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under 
paragraph (b) of this section. You may not use any cost as a deduction 
that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this 
paragraph.
    (1) Firm demand charges paid to pipelines. You may deduct firm 
demand charges or capacity reservation fees paid to a pipeline, 
including charges or fees for unused firm capacity that you have not 
sold before you report your allowance. If you receive a payment from any 
party for release or sale of firm capacity after reporting a 
transportation allowance that included the cost of that unused firm 
capacity, or if you receive a payment or credit from the pipeline for 
penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce 
the firm demand charge claimed on the Form MMS-2014 by the amount of 
that payment. You must modify the Form MMS-2014 by the amount received 
or credited for the affected reporting period, and pay any resulting 
royalty and late payment interest due;
    (2) Gas supply realignment (GSR) costs. The GSR costs result from a 
pipeline reforming or terminating supply contracts with producers to 
implement the restructuring requirements of FERC Orders in 18 CFR part 
284;
    (3) Commodity charges. The commodity charge allows the pipeline to 
recover the costs of providing service;
    (4) Wheeling costs. Hub operators charge a wheeling cost for 
transporting gas from one pipeline to either the same or another 
pipeline through a market center or hub. A hub is a connected manifold 
of pipelines through which a series of incoming pipelines are 
interconnected to a series of outgoing pipelines;
    (5) Gas Research Institute (GRI) fees. The GRI conducts research, 
development, and commercialization programs on natural gas related 
topics for the benefit of the U.S. gas industry and gas customers. GRI 
fees are allowable provided such fees are mandatory in FERC-approved 
tariffs;
    (6) Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) fees. FERC charges these fees to 
pipelines to pay for its operating expenses;
    (7) Payments (either volumetric or in value) for actual or 
theoretical losses. However, theoretical losses are not deductible in 
non-arm's-length transportation arrangements unless the transportation 
allowance is based on arm's-length transportation rates charged under a 
FERC- or state regulatory-approved tariff under paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section. If you receive volumes or credit for line gain, you must reduce 
your transportation allowance accordingly and pay any resulting 
royalties and late payment interest due;
    (8) Temporary storage services. This includes short duration storage 
services offered by market centers or hubs (commonly referred to as 
``parking'' or ``banking''), or other temporary storage services 
provided by pipeline transporters, whether actual or provided as a 
matter of accounting. Temporary storage is limited to 30 days or less; 
and
    (9) Supplemental costs for compression, dehydration, and treatment 
of gas. MMS allows these costs only if such services are required for 
transportation and exceed the services necessary to place production 
into marketable condition required under Sec. Sec. 206.152(i) and 
206.153(i) of this part.
    (10) Costs of surety. You may deduct the costs of securing a letter 
of credit, or other surety, that the pipeline requires you as a shipper 
to maintain under an arm's-length transportation contract.
    (g) Nonallowable costs in determining transportation allowances. 
Lessees may not include the following costs in determining the arm's-
length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section or 
the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (1) Fees or costs incurred for storage. This includes storing 
production in a storage facility, whether on or off the lease, for more 
than 30 days;
    (2) Aggregator/marketer fees. This includes fees you pay to another 
person (including your affiliates) to market your gas, including 
purchasing and reselling the gas, or finding or maintaining a market for 
the gas production;
    (3) Penalties you incur as shipper. These penalties include, but are 
not limited to:
    (i) Over-delivery cash-out penalties. This includes the difference 
between

[[Page 96]]

the price the pipeline pays you for over-delivered volumes outside the 
tolerances and the price you receive for over-delivered volumes within 
the tolerances;
    (ii) Scheduling penalties. This includes penalties you incur for 
differences between daily volumes delivered into the pipeline and 
volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point;
    (iii) Imbalance penalties. This includes penalties you incur 
(generally on a monthly basis) for differences between volumes delivered 
into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or 
delivery point; and
    (iv) Operational penalties. This includes fees you incur for 
violation of the pipeline's curtailment or operational orders issued to 
protect the operational integrity of the pipeline;
    (4) Intra-hub transfer fees. These are fees you pay to hub operators 
for administrative services (e.g., title transfer tracking) necessary to 
account for the sale of gas within a hub;
    (5) Fees paid to brokers. This includes fees paid to parties who 
arrange marketing or transportation, if such fees are separately 
identified from aggregator/marketer fees;
    (6) Fees paid to scheduling service providers. This includes fees 
paid to parties who provide scheduling services, if such fees are 
separately identified from aggregator/marketer fees;
    (7) Internal costs. This includes salaries and related costs, rent/
space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to 
schedule, nominate, and account for sale or movement of production; and
    (8) Other nonallowable costs. Any cost you incur for services you 
are required to provide at no cost to the lessor.
    (h) Other transportation cost determinations. Use this section when 
calculating transportation costs to establish value using a netback 
procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of 
transportation costs.

Sec. 206.158  Processing allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of gas is determined pursuant to Sec. 206.153 
of this subpart, a deduction shall be allowed for the reasonable actual 
costs of processing.
    (b) Processing costs must be allocated among the gas plant products. 
A separate processing allowance must be determined for each gas plant 
product and processing plant relationship. Natural gas liquids (NGL's) 
shall be considered as one product.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the 
processing allowance shall not be applied against the value of the 
residue gas. Where there is no residue gas MMS may designate an 
appropriate gas plant product against which no allowance may be applied.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the 
processing allowance deduction on the basis of an individual product 
shall not exceed 66\2/3\ percent of the value of each gas plant product 
determined in accordance with Sec. 206.153 of this subpart (such value 
to be reduced first for any transportation allowances related to 
postprocessing transportation authorized by Sec. 206.156 of this 
subpart).
    (3) Upon request of a lessee, MMS may approve a processing allowance 
in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. The lessee must demonstrate that the processing costs incurred 
in excess of the limitation prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for 
exception (using Form MMS-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance 
Limitation) shall contain all relevant and supporting documentation for 
MMS to make a determination. Under no circumstances shall the value for 
royalty purposes of any gas plant product be reduced to zero.
    (d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no 
processing cost deduction shall be allowed for the costs of placing 
lease products in marketable condition, including dehydration, 
separation, compression, or storage, even if those functions are 
performed off the lease or at a processing plant. Where gas is processed 
for the

[[Page 97]]

removal of acid gases, commonly referred to as ``sweetening,'' no 
processing cost deduction shall be allowed for such costs unless the 
acid gases removed are further processed into a gas plant product. In 
such event, the lessee shall be eligible for a processing allowance as 
determined in accordance with this subpart. However, MMS will not grant 
any processing allowance for processing lease production which is not 
royalty bearing.
    (2)(i) If the lessee incurs extraordinary costs for processing gas 
production from a gas production operation, it may apply to MMS for an 
allowance for those costs which shall be in addition to any other 
processing allowance to which the lessee is entitled pursuant to this 
section. Such an allowance may be granted only if the lessee can 
demonstrate that the costs are, by reference to standard industry 
conditions and practice, extraordinary, unusual, or unconventional.
    (ii) Prior MMS approval to continue an extraordinary processing cost 
allowance is not required. However, to retain the authority to deduct 
the allowance the lessee must report the deduction to MMS in a form and 
manner prescribed by MMS.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has improperly determined a 
processing allowance authorized by this subpart, then the lessee shall 
pay any additional royalties, plus interest determined in accordance 
with 30 CFR 218.54, or shall be entitled to a credit, without interest. 
If the lessee takes a deduction for processing on the Form MMS-2014 by 
improperly netting the allowance against the sales value of the gas 
plant products instead of reporting the allowance as a separate line 
item, he may be assessed an additional amount under 206.159(d).

<R05>
Sec. 206.159  Determination of processing allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length processing contracts. (1)(i) For processing costs 
incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the processing 
allowance shall be the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee 
for processing the gas under that contract, except as provided in 
paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section, subject to 
monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall have the 
burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. MMS' prior 
approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under 
an arm's-length contract. The lessee must claim a processing allowance 
by reporting it as a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the processor for the 
processing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration, 
then the MMS may require that the processing allowance be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length processing contract does not reflect the reasonable value 
of the processing because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the 
lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and 
lessor, then MMS shall require that the processing allowance be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS 
determines that the value of the processing may be unreasonable, MMS 
will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's processing costs.
    (2) If an arm's-length processing contract includes more than one 
gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product 
can be determined from the contract, then the processing costs for each 
gas plant product shall be determined in accordance with the contract. 
No allowance may be taken for the costs of processing lease production 
which is not royalty-bearing.
    (3) If an arm's-length processing contract includes more than one 
gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product 
cannot be

[[Page 98]]

determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose an allocation 
procedure to MMS. The lessee may use its proposed allocation procedure 
until MMS issues its determination. The lessee shall submit all relevant 
data to support its proposal. MMS shall then determine the processing 
allowance based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional 
information MMS deems necessary. No processing allowance will be granted 
for the costs of processing lease production which is not royalty 
bearing. The lessee must submit the allocation proposal within 3 months 
of claiming the allocated deduction on Form MMS-2014.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for processing under an arm's-length 
contract are not based on a dollar per unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for 
the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length processing contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs processing for itself, the 
processing allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual 
costs as provided in this paragraph. All processing allowances deducted 
under a non-arm's-length or no-contract situation are subject to 
monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee must claim a 
processing allowance by reflecting it as a separate line entry on the 
Form MMS-2014. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its estimated or actual processing allowance.
    (2) The processing allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for processing 
during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial 
depreciable investment in the processing plant multiplied by a rate of 
return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed 
assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment) which are an integral part of the processing plant.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
processing plant; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other 
directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the processing plant is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are 
not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable 
capital investment. When a lessee has elected to use either method for a 
processing plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other 
alternative without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the processing plant services, or a unit-
of-production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not 
change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
processing plant shall not alter the depreciation schedule established 
by the original processor/lessee for purposes of the allowance 
calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a processing plant 
shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below 
a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
initial capital investment in the processing plant multiplied by the 
rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this 
section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This 
alternative shall apply only to plants first placed in service after 
March 1, 1988.

[[Page 99]]

    (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3) The processing allowance for each gas plant product shall be 
determined based on the lessee's reasonable and actual cost of 
processing the gas. Allocation of costs to each gas plant product shall 
be based upon generally accepted accounting principles. The lessee may 
not take an allowance for the costs of processing lease production which 
is not royalty bearing.
    (4) A lessee may apply to MMS for an exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(3) of this section. The MMS may grant the exception only if: 
(i) The lessee has arm's-length contracts for processing other gas 
production at the same processing plant; and (ii) at least 50 percent of 
the gas processed annually at the plant is processed pursuant to arm's-
length processing contracts; if the MMS grants the exception, the lessee 
shall use as its processing allowance the volume weighted average prices 
charged other persons pursuant to arm's-length contracts for processing 
at the same plant.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) The 
lessee must notify MMS of an allowance based on incurred costs by using 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
processing contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted 
within a reasonable time, as determined by MMS.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) The lessee must notify MMS 
of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) For new processing plants, the lessee's initial deduction shall 
include estimates of the allowable gas processing costs for the 
applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently 
available operations data for the plant or, if such data are not 
available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for 
similar gas processing plants.
    (iii) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (iv) If the lessee is authorized to use the volume weighted average 
prices charged other persons as its processing allowance in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(4) of this section, it shall follow the reporting 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a processing 
allowance against the royalty value on the Form MMS-2014, the lessee 
shall be assessed an amount of up to 10 percent of the allowance netted 
not to exceed $250 per lease selling arrangement per sales period.
    (2) If a lessee deducts a processing allowance on its Form MMS-2014 
that exceeds 66\2/3\ percent of the value of the gas processed without 
obtaining prior approval of MMS under Sec. 206.158, the lessee shall 
pay interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date such 
amount is taken to the date the lessee files an exception request with 
MMS.
    (3) If a lessee erroneously reports a processing allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (4) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual processing allowance is less than 
the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-2014 for each month during 
the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay additional 
royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.54 from the 
allowance reporting period when the lessee took the deduction to the 
date the lessee repays the difference to MMS. If the actual processing 
allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-
2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee

[[Page 100]]

shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (2) For lessees processing production from onshore Federal leases, 
the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to reflect actual 
costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (3) For lessees processing gas production from leases on the OCS, if 
the lessee's estimated processing allowance exceeds the allowance based 
on actual costs, the lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-2014 to 
reflect actual costs, together with its payment, in accordance with 
instructions provided by MMS. If the lessee's estimated costs were less 
than the actual costs, the refund procedure will be specified by MMS.
    (f) Other processing cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine processing costs when establishing 
value using a net back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of processing costs.

<R05>
Sec. 206.170  What does this subpart contain?

    This subpart contains royalty valuation provisions applicable to 
Indian lessees.
    (a) This subpart applies to all gas production from Indian (tribal 
and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage Indian 
Reservation). The purpose of this subpart is to establish the value of 
production for royalty purposes consistent with the mineral leasing 
laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms. This subpart does not 
apply to Federal leases.
    (b) If the specific provisions of any Federal statute, treaty, 
negotiated agreement, settlement agreement resulting from any 
administrative or judicial proceeding, or Indian oil and gas lease are 
inconsistent with any regulation in this subpart, then the Federal 
statute, treaty, negotiated agreement, settlement agreement, or lease 
will govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) You may calculate the value of production for royalty purposes 
under methods other than those the regulations in this title require, 
but only if you, the tribal lessor, and MMS jointly agree to the 
valuation methodology. For leases on Indian allotted lands, you and MMS 
must agree to the valuation methodology.
    (d) All royalty payments you make to MMS are subject to monitoring, 
review, audit, and adjustment.
    (e) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the 
trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the 
administration of Indian oil and gas leases are discharged in accordance 
with the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, 
and lease terms.


<R05>
Sec. 206.171  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    The following definitions apply to this subpart and to subpart J of 
part 202 of this title:
    Accounting for comparison means the same as dual accounting.
    Active spot market means a market where one or more MMS-acceptable 
publications publish bidweek prices (or if bidweek prices are not 
available, first of the month prices) for at least one index-pricing 
point in the index zone.
    Allowance means a deduction in determining value for royalty 
purposes. Processing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, 
actual costs of processing gas determined under this subpart. 
Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual 
cost of transportation determined under this subpart.

[[Page 101]]

    Approved Federal Agreement (AFA) means a unit or communitization 
agreement approved under departmental regulations.
    Area means a geographic region at least as large as the defined 
limits of an oil or gas field, in which oil or gas lease products have 
similar quality, economic, or legal characteristics. An area may be all 
lands within the boundaries of an Indian reservation.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes 
of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with another person. The 
following percentages (based on the instruments of ownership of the 
voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership) 
determine if persons are affiliated:
    (1) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control.
    (2) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of 
control.
    (3) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of 
noncontrol which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal 
control, including the existence of interlocking directorates. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between 
relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length 
contracts. MMS may require the lessee to certify the percentage of 
ownership or control of the entity. To be considered arm's-length for 
any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this 
definition for that production month as well as when the contract was 
executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted under generally accepted accounting 
and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of 
lessees or other persons who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian 
leases.
    BIA means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the 
Interior.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Compression means raising the pressure of gas.
    Condensate means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees 
of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to 
processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that 
results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially 
in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Dedicated means a contractual commitment to deliver gas production 
(or a specified portion of production) from a lease or well when that 
production is specified in a sales contract and that production must be 
sold pursuant to that contract to the extent that production occurs from 
that lease or well.
    Drip condensate means any condensate recovered downstream of the 
facility measurement point without resorting to processing. Drip 
condensate includes condensate recovered as a result of its becoming a 
liquid during the transportation of the gas removed from the lease or 
recovered at the inlet of a gas processing plant by mechanical means, 
often referred to as scrubber condensate.
    Dual Accounting (or accounting for comparison) refers to the 
requirement to pay royalty based on a value which is the higher of the 
value of gas prior to processing less any applicable allowances as 
compared to the combined value of drip condensate, residue gas, and gas 
plant products after processing, less applicable allowances.
    Entitlement (or entitled share) means the gas production from a 
lease, or allocable to lease acreage under the terms of an AFA, 
multiplied by the operating rights owner's percentage of interest 
ownership in the lease or the acreage.
    Facility measurement point (or point of royalty settlement) means 
the point where the BLM-approved measurement device is located for 
determining the volume of gas removed from the lease. The facility 
measurement point may be on the lease or off-lease with BLM approval.

[[Page 102]]

    Field means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface 
oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs 
vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually 
given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil 
and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields 
are located.
    Gas means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, 
hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and 
which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand 
indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied 
state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.
    Gas plant products means separate marketable elements, compounds, or 
mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from 
processing gas. However, it does not include residue gas.
    Gathering means the movement of lease production to a central 
accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized 
area; or a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, unit, 
or communitized area as approved by BLM operations personnel.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the 
disposition of unprocessed gas, residue gas, and gas plant products 
produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not limited to, payments to 
the lessee for certain services such as compression, dehydration, 
measurement, or field gathering to the extent that the lessee is 
obligated to perform them at no cost to the Indian lessor, and payments 
for gas processing rights. Gross proceeds, as applied to gas, also 
includes but is not limited to reimbursements for severance taxes and 
other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds 
accruing to a lessee even though the Indian royalty interest is exempt 
from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the forms of 
consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee is 
contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to collect 
through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Index means the calculated composite price ($/MMBtu) of spot-market 
sales published by a publication that meets MMS-established criteria for 
acceptability at the index-pricing point.
    Index-pricing point (IPP) means any point on a pipeline for which 
there is an index.
    Index zone means a field or an area with an active spot market and 
published indices applicable to that field or area that are acceptable 
to MMS under Sec. 206.172(d)(2).
    Indian allottee means any Indian for whom land or an interest in 
land is held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to 
Federal restriction against alienation.
    Indian tribe means any Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, 
community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any 
land or interest in land is held in trust by the United States or which 
is subject to Federal restriction against alienation.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a 
mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or 
extraction of, or removal of lease products--or the land area covered by 
that authorization, whichever is required by the context. For purposes 
of this subpart, this definition excludes Federal leases.
    Lease products means any leased minerals attributable to, 
originating from, or allocated to a lease.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States, a tribe, and/or 
individual Indian landowner issues a lease, and any person who has been 
assigned an obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the 
lease. This includes any person who has an interest in a lease 
(including operating rights owners) as well as an operator or payor who 
has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment 
responsibility.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products which have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.

[[Page 103]]

    Marketable condition means a condition in which lease products are 
sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise so conditioned that a 
purchaser will accept them under a sales contract typical for the field 
or area.
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service, Department of the 
Interior. MMS includes, where appropriate, tribal auditors acting under 
agreements under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, 
30 U.S.C. 1701 et seq. or other applicable agreements.
    Minimum royalty means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the 
lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing 
regulations.
    Natural gas liquids (NGL's) means those gas plant products 
consisting of ethane, propane, butane, or heavier liquid hydrocarbons.
    Net-back method (or work-back method) means a method for calculating 
market value of gas at the lease under which costs of transportation, 
processing, and manufacturing are deducted from the proceeds received 
for, or the value of, the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products, and 
any extracted, processed, or manufactured products, at the first point 
at which reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a 
sale under an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of such 
products.
    Net output means the quantity of residue gas and each gas plant 
product that a processing plant produces.
    Net profit share means the specified share of the net profit from 
production of oil and gas as provided in the agreement.
    Operating rights owner (or working interest owner) means any person 
who owns operating rights in a lease subject to this subpart. A record 
title owner is the owner of operating rights under a lease except to the 
extent that the operating rights or a portion thereof have been 
transferred from record title (see BLM regulations at 43 CFR 3100.0-
5(d)).
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Point of royalty measurement means the same as facility measurement 
point.

compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including 
absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally 
take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, 
mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, desulphurization 
(or ``sweetening''), and compression, are not considered processing. The 
changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not 
considered processing.
    Residue gas means that hydrocarbon gas consisting principally of 
methane resulting from processing gas.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of gas, residue gas and gas plant 
products are made. Selling arrangements are described by illustration in 
the ``MMS Royalty Management Program Oil and Gas Payor Handbook.''
    Spot sales agreement means a contract wherein a seller agrees to 
sell to a buyer a specified amount of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or 
gas plant products at a specified price over a fixed period, usually of 
short duration. It also does not normally require a cancellation notice 
to terminate, and does not contain an obligation, or imply an intent, to 
continue in subsequent periods.
    Takes means when the operating rights owner sells or removes 
production from, or allocated to, the lease, or when such sale or 
removal occurs for the benefit of an operating rights owner.
    Work-back method means the same as net-back method.

Sec. 206.172  How do I value gas produced from leases in an index zone?

    (a) What leases this section applies to. This section explains how 
lessees must value, for royalty purposes, gas produced from Indian 
leases located in an index zone. For other leases, value must be 
determined under Sec. 206.174.
    (1) You must use the valuation provision of this section if your 
lease is in

[[Page 104]]

an index zone and meets one of the following two requirements:
    (i) Has a major portion provision;
    (ii) Does not have a major portion provision, but provides for the 
Secretary to determine the value of production.
    (2) This section does not apply to carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or 
other non-hydrocarbon components of the gas stream. However, if they are 
recovered and sold separately from the gas stream, you must determine 
the value of these products under Sec. 206.174.
    (b) Valuing residue gas and gas before processing. (1) Except as 
provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, this paragraph 
(b) explains how you must value the following four types of gas:
    (i) Gas production before processing;
    (ii) Gas production that you certify on Form MMS-4410, Certification 
for Not Performing Accounting for Comparison (Dual Accounting), is not 
processed before it flows into a pipeline with an index but which may be 
processed later;
    (iii) Residue gas after processing; and
    (iv) Gas that is never processed.
    (2) The value of gas production that is not sold under an arm's-
length dedicated contract is the index-based value determined under 
paragraph (d) of this section unless the gas was subject to a previous 
contract which was part of a gas contract settlement. If the previous 
contract was subject to a gas contract settlement and if the royalty-
bearing contract settlement proceeds per MMBtu added to the 80 percent 
of the safety net prices calculated at Sec. 206.172(e)(4)(i) exceeds 
the index-based value that applies to the gas under this section 
(including any adjustments required under Sec. 206.176), then the value 
of the gas is the higher of the value determined under this section 
(including any adjustments required under Sec. 206.176) or Sec.  
206.174.
    (3) The value of gas production that is sold under an arm's-length 
dedicated contract is the higher of the index-based value under 
paragraph (d) of this section or the value of that production determined 
under Sec. 206.174(b).
    (c) Valuing gas that is processed before it flows into a pipeline 
with an index. Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of 
this section, this paragraph (c) explains how you must value gas that is 
processed before it flows into a pipeline with an index. You must value 
this gas production based on the higher of the following two values:
    (1) The value of the gas before processing determined under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) The value of the gas after processing, which is either the 
alternative dual accounting value under Sec. 206.173 or the sum of the 
following three values:
    (i) The value of the residue gas determined under paragraph (b)(2) 
or (3) of this section, as applicable;
    (ii) The value of the gas plant products determined under Sec. 
206.174, less any applicable processing and/or transportation allowances 
determined under this subpart; and
    (iii) The value of any drip condensate associated with the processed 
gas determined under subpart B of this part.
    (d) Determining the index-based value for gas production. (1) To 
determine the index-based value per MMBtu for production from a lease in 
an index zone, you must use the following procedures:
    (i) For each MMS-approved publication, calculate the average of the 
highest reported prices for all index-pricing points in the index zone, 
except for any prices excluded under paragraph (d)(6) of this section;
    (ii) Sum the averages calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this 
section and divide by the number of publications; and
    (iii) Reduce the number calculated under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of 
this section by 10 percent, but not by less than 10 cents per MMBtu or 
more than 30 cents per MMBtu. The result is the index-based value per 
MMBtu for production from all leases in that index zone.
    (2) MMS will publish in the Federal Register the index zones that 
are eligible for the index-based valuation method under this paragraph. 
MMS will monitor the market activity in the index zones and, if 
necessary, hold a technical conference to add or modify a particular 
index zone. Any change to the index zones will be published in the 
Federal Register. MMS will consider

[[Page 105]]

the following five factors and conditions in determining eligible index 
zones:
    (i) Areas for which MMS-approved publications establish index prices 
that accurately reflect the value of production in the field or area 
where the production occurs;
    (ii) Common markets served;
    (iii) Common pipeline systems;
    (iv) Simplification; and
    (v) Easy identification in MMS's systems, such as counties or Indian 
reservations.
    (3) If market conditions change so that an index-based method for 
determining value is no longer appropriate for an index zone, MMS will 
hold a technical conference to consider disqualification of an index 
zone. MMS will publish notice in the Federal Register if an index zone 
is disqualified. If an index zone is disqualified, then production from 
leases in that index zone cannot be valued under this paragraph.
    (4) MMS periodically will publish in the Federal Register a list of 
acceptable publications based on certain criteria, including, but not 
limited to the following five criteria:
    (i) Publications buyers and sellers frequently use;
    (ii) Publications frequently referenced in purchase or sales 
contracts;
    (iii) Publications that use adequate survey techniques, including 
the gathering of information from a substantial number of sales;
    (iv) Publications that publish the range of reported prices they use 
to calculate their index; and
    (v) Publications independent from DOI, lessors, and lessees.
    (5) Any publication may petition MMS to be added to the list of 
acceptable publications.
    (6) MMS may exclude an individual index price for an index zone in 
an MMS-approved publication if MMS determines that the index price does 
not accurately reflect the value of production in that index zone. MMS 
will publish a list of excluded indices in the Federal Register.
    (7) MMS will reference which tables in the publications you must use 
for determining the associated index prices.
    (8) The index-based values determined under this paragraph are not 
subject to deductions for transportation or processing allowances 
determined under Sec. Sec. 206.177, 206.178, 206.179, and 206.180.
    (e) Determining the minimum value for royalty purposes of gas sold 
beyond the first index pricing point. (1) Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this section, the value for royalty purposes of gas 
production from an Indian lease that is sold beyond the first index 
pricing point through which it flows cannot be less than the value 
determined under this paragraph (e).
    (2) By June 30 following any calendar year, you must calculate for 
each month of that calendar year your safety net price per MMBtu using 
the procedures in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. You must calculate a 
safety net price for each month and for each index zone where you have 
an Indian lease for which you report and pay royalties.
    (3) Your safety net price (S) for an index zone is the volume-
weighted average contract price per delivered MMBtu under your or your 
affiliate's arm's-length contracts for the disposition of residue gas or 
unprocessed gas produced from your Indian leases in that index zone as 
computed under this paragraph (e)(3).
    (i) Include in your calculation only sales under those contracts 
that establish a delivery point beyond the first index pricing point 
through which the gas flows, and that include any gas produced from or 
allocable to one or more of your Indian leases in that index zone, even 
if the contract also includes gas produced from Federal, State, or fee 
properties. Include in your volume-weighted average calculation those 
volumes that are allocable to your Indian leases in that index zone.
    (ii) Do not reduce the contract price for any transportation costs 
incurred to deliver the gas to the purchaser.
    (iii) For purposes of this paragraph (e), the contract price will 
not include the following amounts:
    (A) Any amounts you receive in compromise or settlement of a 
predecessor contract for that gas;

[[Page 106]]

    (B) Deductions for you or any other person to put gas production 
into marketable condition or to market the gas; and
    (C) Any amounts related to marketable securities associated with the 
sales contract.
    (4) Next, you must determine for each month the safety net 
differential (SND). You must perform this calculation separately for 
each index zone.
    (i) For each index zone, the safety net differential is equal to: 
SND = [(0.80 x S) - (1.25 x I)] where (I) is the index-based value 
determined under 30 CFR 206.172(d).
    (ii) If the safety net differential is positive you owe additional 
royalties.
    (5)(i) To calculate the additional royalties you owe, make the 
following calculation for each of your Indian leases in that index zone 
that produced gas that was sold beyond the first index-pricing point 
through which the gas flowed and that was used in the calculation in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section:

    Lease royalties owed = SND x V x R, where R = the lease royalty rate 
and V = the volume allocable to the lease which produced gas that was 
sold beyond the first index pricing point.

    (ii) If gas produced from any of your Indian leases is commingled or 
pooled with gas produced from non-Indian properties, and if any of the 
combined gas is sold at a delivery point beyond the first index pricing 
point through which the gas flows, then the volume allocable to each 
Indian lease for which gas was sold beyond the first index pricing point 
in the calculation under paragraph (e)(5)(i) of this section is the 
volume produced from the lease multiplied by the proportion that the 
total volume of gas sold beyond the first index pricing point bears to 
the total volume of gas commingled or pooled from all properties.
    (iii) Add the numbers calculated for each lease under paragraph 
(e)(5)(i) of this section. The total is the additional royalty you owe.
    (6) You have the following responsibilities to comply with the 
minimum value for royalty purposes:
    (i) You must report the safety net price for each index zone to MMS 
on Form MMS-4411, Safety Net Report, no later than June 30 following 
each calendar year;
    (ii) You must pay and report on Form MMS-2014 additional royalties 
due no later than June 30 following each calendar year; and
    (iii) MMS may order you to amend your safety net price within one 
year from the date your Form MMS-4411 is due or is filed, whichever is 
later. If MMS does not order any amendments within that one-year period, 
your safety net price calculation is final.
    (f) Excluding some or all tribal leases from valuation under this 
section. (1) An Indian tribe may ask MMS to exclude some or all of its 
leases from valuation under this section. MMS will consult with BIA 
regarding the request.
    (i) If MMS approves the request for your lease, you must value your 
production under Sec. 206.174 beginning with production on the first 
day of the second month following the date MMS publishes notice of its 
decision in the Federal Register.
    (ii) If an Indian tribe requests exclusion from an index zone for 
less than all of its leases, MMS will approve the request only if the 
excluded leases may be segregated into one or more groups based on 
separate fields within the reservation.
    (2) An Indian tribe may ask MMS to terminate exclusion of its leases 
from valuation under this section. MMS will consult with BIA regarding 
the request.
    (i) If MMS approves the request, you must value your production 
under Sec. 206.172 beginning with production on the first day of the 
second month following the date MMS publishes notice of its decision in 
the Federal Register.
    (ii) Termination of an exclusion under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section cannot take effect earlier than 1 year after the first day of 
the production month that the exclusion was effective.
    (3) The Indian tribe's request to MMS under either paragraph (f)(1) 
or (2) of this section must be in the form of a tribal resolution.
    (g) Excluding Indian allotted leases from valuation under this 
section. (1)(i) MMS may exclude any Indian allotted

[[Page 107]]

leases from valuation under this section. MMS will consult with BIA 
regarding the exclusion.
    (ii) If MMS excludes your lease, you must value your production 
under Sec. 206.174 beginning with production on the first day of the 
second month following the date MMS publishes notice of its decision in 
the Federal Register.
    (iii) If MMS excludes any Indian allotted leases under this 
paragraph (g)(1), it will exclude all Indian allotted leases in the same 
field.
    (2)(i) MMS may terminate the exclusion of any Indian allotted leases 
from valuation under this section. MMS will consult with BIA regarding 
the termination.
    (ii) If MMS terminates the exclusion, you must value your production 
under Sec. 206.172 beginning with production on the first day of the 
second month following the date MMS publishes notice of its decision in 
the Federal Register.

Sec. 206.173  How do I calculate the alternative methodology for dual 
accounting?

    (a) Electing a dual accounting method. (1) If you are required to 
perform the accounting for comparison (dual accounting) under Sec. 
206.176, you have two choices. You may elect to perform the dual 
accounting calculation according to either Sec. 206.176(a) (called 
actual dual accounting), or paragraph (b) of this section (called the 
alternative methodology for dual accounting).
    (2) You must make a separate election to use the alternative 
methodology for dual accounting for your Indian leases in each MMS-
designated area. Your election for a designated area must apply to all 
of your Indian leases in that area.
    (i) MMS will publish in the Federal Register a list of the lease 
prefixes that will be associated with each designated area for purposes 
of this section. The MMS-designated areas are as follows:
    (A) Alabama-Coushatta;
    (B) Blackfeet Reservation;
    (C) Crow Reservation;
    (D) Fort Belknap Reservation;
    (E) Fort Berthold Reservation;
    (F) Fort Peck Reservation;
    (G) Jicarilla Apache Reservation;
    (H) MMS-designated groups of counties in the State of Oklahoma;
    (I) Navajo Reservation;
    (J) Northern Cheyenne Reservation;
    (K) Rocky Boys Reservation;
    (L) Southern Ute Reservation;
    (M) Turtle Mountain Reservation;
    (N) Ute Mountain Ute Reservation;
    (O) Uintah and Ouray Reservation;
    (P) Wind River Reservation; and
    (Q) Any other area that MMS designates. MMS will publish a new area 
designation in the Federal Register.
    (ii) You may elect to begin using the alternative methodology for 
dual accounting at the beginning of any month. The first election to use 
the alternative methodology will be effective from the time of election 
through the end of the following calendar year. Thereafter, each 
election to use the alternative methodology must remain in effect for 2 
calendar years. You may return to the actual dual accounting method only 
at the beginning of the next election period or with the written 
approval of MMS and the tribal lessor for tribal leases, and MMS for 
Indian allottee leases in the designated area.
    (iii) When you elect to use the alternative methodology for a 
designated area, you must also use the alternative methodology for any 
new wells commenced and any new leases acquired in the designated area 
during the term of the election.
    (b) Calculating value using the alternative methodology for dual 
accounting. (1) The alternative methodology adjusts the value of gas 
before processing determined under either Sec. 206.172 or Sec.  206.174 
to provide the value of the gas after processing. You must use the value 
of the gas after processing for royalty payment purposes. The amount of 
the increase depends on your relationship with the owner(s) of the plant 
where the gas is processed. If you have no direct or indirect ownership 
interest in the processing plant, then the increase is lower, as 
provided in the table in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. If you 
have a direct or indirect ownership interest in the plant where the gas 
is processed, the increase is higher, as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section.

[[Page 108]]

    (2) To calculate the value of the gas after processing using the 
alternative methodology for dual accounting, you must apply the increase 
to the value before processing, determined in either Sec. 206.172 or 
Sec. 206.174, as follows:
    (i) Value of gas after processing = (value determined under either 
Sec. 206.172 or Sec.  206.174, as applicable) x (1 + increment for dual 
accounting); and
    (ii) In this equation, the increment for dual accounting is the 
number you take from the applicable Btu range, determined under 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 Increment    Increment

1701+.........................................        .2000        .3550
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) The applicable Btu for purposes of this section is the volume 
weighted-average Btu for the lease computed from measurements at the 
facility measurement point(s) for gas production from the lease.
    (4) If any of your gas from the lease is processed during a month, 
use the following two paragraphs to determine which amounts are subject 
to dual accounting and which dual accounting method you must use.
    (i) Weighted-average Btu content determined under paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section is greater than 1,000 Btu's per cubic foot (Btu/cf). All 
gas production from the lease is subject to dual accounting and you must 
use the alternative method for all that gas production if you elected to 
use the alternative method under this section.
    (ii) Weighted-average Btu content determined under paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section is less than or equal to 1,000 Btu/cf. Only the volumes 
of lease production measured at facility measurement points whose 
quality exceeds 1,000 Btu/cf are subject to dual accounting, and you may 
use the alternative methodology for these volumes. For gas measured at 
facility measurement points for these leases where the quality is equal 
to or less than 1,000 Btu/cf, you are not required to do dual 
accounting.


<R05>
Sec. 206.174  How do I value gas production when an index-based method 
cannot be used?

    (a) Situations in which an index-based method cannot be used. (1) 
Gas production must be valued under this section in the following 
situations.
    (i) Your lease is not in an index zone (or MMS has excluded your 
lease from an index zone).
    (ii) If your lease is in an index zone and you sell your gas under 
an arm's-length dedicated contract, then the value of your gas is the 
higher of the value received under the dedicated contract determined 
under Sec. 206.174(b) or the value under Sec.  206.172.
    (iii) Also use this section to value any other gas production that 
cannot be valued under Sec. 206.172, as well as gas plant products, and 
to value components of the gas stream that have no Btu value (for 
example, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, etc.).
    (2) The value for royalty purposes of gas production subject to this 
subpart is the value of gas determined under this section less 
applicable allowances determined under this subpart.
    (3) You must determine the value of gas production that is processed 
and is subject to accounting for comparison using the procedure in Sec. 
206.176.
    (4) This paragraph applies if your lease has a major portion 
provision. It also applies if your lease does not have a major portion 
provision but the lease provides for the Secretary to determine value.
    (i) The value of production you must initially report and pay is the 
value determined in accordance with the other paragraphs of this 
section.
    (ii) MMS will determine the major portion value and notify you in 
the Federal Register of that value. The value of production for royalty 
purposes for your lease is the higher of either the value determined 
under this

[[Page 109]]

section which you initially used to report and pay royalties, or the 
major portion value calculated under this paragraph (a)(4). If the major 
portion value is higher, you must submit an amended Form MMS-2014 to MMS 
by the due date specified in the written notice from MMS of the major 
portion value. Late-payment interest under 30 CFR 218.54 on any 
underpayment will not begin to accrue until the date the amended Form 
MMS-2014 is due to MMS.
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section, 
MMS will calculate the major portion value for each designated area 
(which are the same designated areas as under Sec. 206.173) using 
values reported for unprocessed gas and residue gas on Form MMS-2014 for 
gas produced from leases on that Indian reservation or other designated 
area. MMS will array the reported prices from highest to lowest price. 
The major portion value is that price at which 25 percent (by volume) of 
the gas (starting from the highest) is sold. MMS cannot unilaterally 
change the major portion value after you are notified in writing of what 
that value is for your leases.
    (iv) MMS may calculate the major portion value using different data 
than the data described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section or data 
to augment the data described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section. 
This may include price data reported to the State tax authority or price 
data from leases MMS has reviewed in the designated area. MMS may use 
this alternate or the augmented data source beginning with production on 
the first day of the month following the date MMS publishes notice in 
the Federal Register that it is calculating the major portion using a 
method in this paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section.
    (b) Arm's-length contracts. (1) The value of gas, residue gas, or 
any gas plant product you sell under an arm's-length contract is the 
gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate, except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)-(iv) of this section.
    (i) You have the burden of demonstrating that your contract is 
arm's-length.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits for gas valued based upon 
gross proceeds under this paragraph, MMS will examine whether or not 
your contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the buyer to you or your affiliate 
for the gas, residue gas, or gas plant product. If the contract does not 
reflect the total consideration, then MMS may require that the gas, 
residue gas, or gas plant product sold under that contract be valued in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate, including the 
additional consideration.
    (iii) If MMS determines for gas valued under this paragraph that the 
gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under an arm's-length 
contract do not reflect the value of the gas, residue gas, or gas plant 
products because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or 
because you otherwise have breached your duty to the lessor to market 
the production for the mutual benefit of you and the lessor, then MMS 
will require that the gas, residue gas, or gas plant product be valued 
under paragraphs (c)(2) or (3) of this section. In these circumstances, 
MMS will notify you and give you an opportunity to provide written 
information justifying your value.
    (iv) This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases 
gas from a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation 
contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price 
the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for 
over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same 
value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those 
volumes are subject to a lower price specified in the transportation 
contract. However, if MMS determines that the price specified in the 
transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low, 
the lessees must value all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2) 
or (3) of this section.
    (2) MMS may require you to certify that your arm's-length contract 
provisions include all of the consideration

[[Page 110]]

the buyer pays, either directly or indirectly, for the gas, residue gas, 
or gas plant product.
    (c) Non-arm's-length contracts. If your gas, residue gas, or any gas 
plant product is not sold under an arm's-length contract, then you must 
value the production using the first applicable method of the following 
three methods:
    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to you under your non-arm's-length 
contract sale (or other disposition other than by an arm's-length 
contract), provided that those gross proceeds are equivalent to the 
gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable arm's-length 
contracts for purchases, sales, or other dispositions of like-quality 
gas in the same field (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, 
from the same area). For residue gas or gas plant products, the 
comparable arm's-length contracts must be for gas from the same 
processing plant (or, if necessary to obtain a reasonable sample, from 
nearby plants). In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length 
contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the following factors 
will be considered: price, time of execution, duration, market or 
markets served, terms, quality of gas, residue gas, or gas plant 
products, volume, and such other factors as may be appropriate to 
reflect the value of the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.
    (2) A value determined by consideration of other information 
relevant in valuing like-quality gas, residue gas, or gas plant 
products, including gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts for 
like-quality gas in the same field or nearby fields or areas, or for 
residue gas or gas plant products from the same gas plant or other 
nearby processing plants. Other factors to consider include prices 
received in spot sales of gas, residue gas or gas plant products, other 
reliable public sources of price or market information, and other 
information as to the particular lease operation or the salability of 
such gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.
    (3) A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine 
value.
    (d) Supporting data. If you determine the value of production under 
paragraph (c) of this section, you must retain all data relevant to the 
determination of royalty value.
    (1) Such data will be subject to review and audit, and MMS will 
direct you to use a different value if we determine upon review or audit 
that the value you reported is inconsistent with the requirements of 
these regulations.
    (2) You must make all such data available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or Indian representatives, to the Office of the Inspector 
General of the Department, or other authorized persons. This includes 
your arm's-length sales and volume data for like-quality gas, residue 
gas, and gas plant products that are sold, purchased, or otherwise 
obtained from the same processing plant or from nearby processing 
plants, or from the same or nearby field or area.
    (e) Improper values. If MMS determines that you have not properly 
determined value, you must pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value you used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value MMS established. You also must pay 
interest computed on that difference under 30 CFR 218.54. If you are 
entitled to a credit, MMS will provide instructions on how to take that 
credit.
    (f) Value guidance. You may ask MMS for guidance in determining 
value. You may propose a valuation method to MMS. Submit all available 
data related to your proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. MMS will promptly review your proposal and provide you with a 
non-binding determination of the guidance you request.
    (g) Minimum value of production. (1) For gas, residue gas, and gas 
plant products valued under this section, under no circumstances may the 
value of production for royalty purposes be less than the gross proceeds 
accruing to the lessee (including its affiliates) for gas, residue gas 
and/or any gas plant products, less applicable transportation allowances 
and processing allowances determined under this subpart.
    (2) For gas plant products valued under this section and not valued

[[Page 111]]

under Sec. 206.173, the alternative methodology for dual accounting, 
the minimum value of production for each gas plant product is as 
follows:
    (i) Leases in certain States and areas have specific minimum values.
    (A) For production from leases in Colorado in the San Juan Basin, 
New Mexico, and Texas, the monthly average minimum price reported in 
commercial price bulletins for the gas plant product at Mont Belvieu, 
Texas, minus 8.0 cents per gallon.
    (B) For production in Arizona, in Colorado outside the San Juan 
Basin, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, 
and Wyoming, the monthly average minimum price reported in commercial 
price bulletins for the gas plant product at Conway, Kansas, minus 7.0 
cents per gallon;
    (ii) You may use any commercial price bulletin, but you must use the 
same bulletin for all of the calendar year. If the commercial price 
bulletin you are using stops publication, you may use a different 
commercial price bulletin for the remaining part of the calendar year; 
and (iii) If you use a commercial price bulletin that is published 
monthly, the monthly average minimum price is the bulletin's minimum 
price. If you use a commercial price bulletin that is published weekly, 
the monthly average minimum price is the arithmetic average of the 
bulletin's weekly minimum prices. If you use a commercial price bulletin 
that is published daily, the monthly average minimum price is the 
arithmetic average of the bulletin's minimum prices for each Wednesday 
in the month.
    (h) Marketable condition/Marketing. You are required to place gas, 
residue gas, and gas plant products in marketable condition and market 
the gas for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost 
to the Indian lessor. When your gross proceeds establish the value under 
this section, that value must be increased to the extent that the gross 
proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, 
is providing certain services to place the gas, residue gas, or gas 
plant products in marketable condition or to market the gas, the cost of 
which ordinarily is your responsibility.
    (i) Highest obtainable price or benefit. For gas, residue gas, and 
gas plant products valued under this section, value must be based on the 
highest price a prudent lessee can receive through legally enforceable 
claims under its contract. Absent contract revision or amendment, if you 
fail to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to 
which you are entitled, you must pay royalty at a value based upon that 
obtainable price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments must be in 
writing and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract. If you 
make timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under 
your contract but the purchaser refuses, and you take reasonable 
measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, you will 
owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration 
resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. 
This paragraph is not intended to permit you to avoid your royalty 
payment obligation in situations where your purchaser fails to pay, in 
whole or in part, or timely, for a quantity of gas, residue gas, or gas 
plant product.
    (j) Non-binding MMS reviews. Notwithstanding any provision in these 
regulations to the contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or 
other like process that results in an MMS redetermination of value under 
this section will be considered final or binding against the Federal 
Government or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally 
closed.
    (k) Confidential information. Certain information submitted to MMS 
to support valuation proposals, including transportation allowances and 
processing allowances, may be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom 
of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data 
specified by law to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt, 
will be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations. All requests for information about 
determinations made under this subpart must be submitted in accordance 
with

[[Page 112]]

the Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department of the 
Interior, 43 CFR part 2.

[64 FR 43515, Aug. 10, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 62614, Oct. 19, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 206.175  How do I determine quantities and qualities of production 
for computing royalties?

    (a) For unprocessed gas, you must pay royalties on the quantity and 
quality at the facility measurement point BLM either allowed or 
approved.
    (b) For residue gas and gas plant products, you must pay royalties 
on your share of the monthly net output of the plant even though residue 
gas and/or gas plant products may be in temporary storage.
    (c) If you have no ownership interest in the processing plant and 
you do not operate the plant, you may use the contract volume allocation 
to determine your share of plant products.
    (d) If you have an ownership interest in the plant or if you operate 
it, use the following procedure to determine the quantity of the residue 
gas and gas plant products attributable to you for royalty payment 
purposes:
    (1) When the net output of the processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from only one lease, the quantity of the residue gas and gas 
plant products on which you must pay royalty is the net output of the 
plant.
    (2) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from more than one lease producing gas of uniform content, the 
quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each 
lease must be in the same proportions as the ratios obtained by dividing 
the amount of gas delivered to the plant from each lease by the total 
amount of gas delivered from all leases.
    (3) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas 
obtained from more than one lease producing gas of non-uniform content, 
the volumes of residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each 
lease are based on theoretical volumes of residue gas and gas plant 
products measured in the lease gas stream. You must calculate the 
portion of net plant output of residue gas and gas plant products 
attributable to each lease as follows:
    (i) First, compute the theoretical volumes of residue gas and of gas 
plant products attributable to the lease by multiplying the lease volume 
of the gas stream by the tested residue gas content (mole percentage) or 
gas plant product (GPM) content of the gas stream;
    (ii) Second, calculate the theoretical volumes of residue gas and of 
gas plant products delivered from all leases by summing the theoretical 
volumes of residue gas and of gas plant products delivered from each 
lease; and
    (iii) Third, calculate the theoretical quantities of net plant 
output of residue gas and of gas plant products attributable to each 
lease by multiplying the net plant output of residue gas, or gas plant 
products, by the ratio in which the theoretical volumes of residue gas, 
or gas plant products, is the numerator and the theoretical volume of 
residue gas, or gas plant products, delivered from all leases is the 
denominator.
    (4) You may request MMS approval of other methods for determining 
the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each 
lease. If MMS approves a different method, it will be applicable to all 
gas production from your Indian leases that is processed in the same 
plant.
    (e) You may not take any deductions from the royalty volume or 
royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of 
unprocessed gas incurred prior to the facility measurement point will 
not be subject to royalty if BLM determines that the loss was 
unavoidable.


<R05>
Sec. 206.176  How do I perform accounting for comparison?

    (a) This section applies if the gas produced from your Indian lease 
is processed and that Indian lease requires accounting for comparison 
(also referred to as actual dual accounting). Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the actual dual accounting 
value, for royalty purposes, is the greater of the following two values:
    (1) The combined value of the following products:
    (i) The residue gas and gas plant products resulting from processing 
the gas determined under either Sec. 206.172 or

[[Page 113]]

Sec. 206.174, less any applicable allowances; and
    (ii) Any drip condensate associated with the processed gas recovered 
downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to 
processing determined under Sec. 206.52, less applicable allowances.
    (2) The value of the gas prior to processing determined under either 
Sec. 206.172 or Sec.  206.174, including any applicable allowances.
    (b) If you are required to account for comparison, you may elect to 
use the alternative dual accounting methodology provided for in Sec. 
206.173 instead of the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Accounting for comparison is not required for gas if no gas from 
the lease is processed until after the gas flows into a pipeline with an 
index located in an index zone or into a mainline pipeline not in an 
index zone. If you do not perform dual accounting, you must certify to 
MMS that gas flows into such a pipeline before it is processed.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if you 
value any gas production from a lease for a month using the dual 
accounting provisions of this section or the alternative dual accounting 
methodology of Sec. 206.173, then the value of that gas is the minimum 
value for any other gas production from that lease for that month 
flowing through the same facility measurement point.
    (e) If the weighted-average Btu quality for your lease is less than 
1,000 Btu's per cubic foot, see Sec. 206.173(b)(4)(ii) to determine if 
you must perform a dual accounting calculation.

                        Transportation Allowances


<R05>
Sec. 206.177  What general requirements regarding transportation 
allowances apply to me?

    (a) When you value gas under Sec. 206.174 at a point off the lease, 
unit, or communitized area (for example, sales point or point of value 
determination), you may deduct from value a transportation allowance to 
reflect the value, for royalty purposes, at the lease, unit, or 
communitized area. The allowance is based on the reasonable actual costs 
you incurred to transport unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant 
products from a lease to a point off the lease, unit, or communitized 
area. This would include, if appropriate, transportation from the lease 
to a gas processing plant off the lease, unit, or communitized area and 
from the plant to a point away from the plant. You may not deduct any 
allowance for gathering costs.
    (b) You must allocate transportation costs among all products you 
produce and transport as provided in Sec. 206.178.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this 
section, your transportation allowance deduction for each selling 
arrangement may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the unprocessed 
gas, residue gas, or gas plant product. For purposes of this section, 
natural gas liquids are considered one product.
    (2) If you ask MMS, MMS may approve a transportation allowance 
deduction in excess of the limitations in paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section. To receive this approval, you must demonstrate that the 
transportation costs incurred in excess of the limitations in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. Under no 
circumstances may an allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes 
under any selling arrangement to zero.
    (3) Your application for exception (using Form MMS-4393, Request to 
Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) must contain all relevant and 
supporting documentation necessary for MMS to make a determination.
    (d) If MMS conducts a review or audit and determines that you have 
improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
subpart, then you will be required to pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.54. Alternatively, you 
may be entitled to a credit, but you will not receive any interest on 
your overpayment.


<R05>
Sec. 206.178  How do I determine a transportation allowance?

    (a) Determining a transportation allowance under an arm's-length 
contract. (1) This paragraph explains how to determine your allowance if 
you have an arm's-length transportation contract.

[[Page 114]]

    (i) If you have an arm's-length contract for transportation of your 
production, the transportation allowance is the reasonable, actual costs 
you incur for transporting the unprocessed gas, residue gas and/or gas 
plant products under that contract. Paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of 
this section provide a limited exception. You have the burden of 
demonstrating that your contract is arm's-length. Your allowances also 
are subject to paragraph (e) of this section. You are required to submit 
to MMS a copy of your arm's-length transportation contract(s) and all 
subsequent amendments to the contract(s) within 2 months of the date MMS 
receives your report which claims the allowance on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) When either MMS or a tribe conducts reviews and audits, they 
will examine whether or not the contract reflects more than the 
consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from 
you to the transporter of the transportation. If the contract reflects 
more than the total consideration, then MMS may require that the 
transportation allowance be determined under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-
length transportation contract does not reflect the value of the 
transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because you otherwise have breached your duty to the lessor 
to market the production for the mutual benefit of you and the lessor, 
then MMS will require that the transportation allowance be determined 
under paragraph (b) of this section. In these circumstances, MMS will 
notify you and give you an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying your transportation costs.
    (2) This paragraph explains how to allocate the costs to each 
product if your arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one product in a gaseous phase and the transportation costs attributable 
to each product cannot be determined from the contract.
    (i) If your arm's-length transportation contract includes more than 
one product in a gaseous phase and the transportation costs attributable 
to each product cannot be determined from the contract, the total 
transportation costs must be allocated in a consistent and equitable 
manner to each of the products transported. To make this allocation, use 
the same proportion as the ratio that the volume of each product 
(excluding waste products which have no value) bears to the volume of 
all products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products which have 
no value). Except as provided in this paragraph, you cannot take an 
allowance for the costs of transporting lease production that is not 
royalty bearing without MMS approval, or without lessor approval on 
tribal leases.
    (ii) As an alternative to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, you 
may propose to MMS a cost allocation method based on the values of the 
products transported. MMS will approve the method if we determine that 
it meets one of the two following requirements:
    (A) The methodology in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section cannot be 
applied; and
    (B) Your proposal is more reasonable than the methodology in 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.
    (3) This paragraph explains how to allocate costs to each product if 
your arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous and 
liquid products and the transportation costs attributable to each cannot 
be determined from the contract.
    (i) If your arm's-length transportation contract includes both 
gaseous and liquid products and the transportation costs attributable to 
each cannot be determined from the contract, you must propose an 
allocation procedure to MMS. You may use the transportation allowance 
determined in accordance with your proposed allocation procedure until 
MMS decides whether to accept your cost allocation.
    (ii) You are required to submit all relevant data to support your 
allocation proposal. MMS will then determine the gas transportation 
allowance based upon your proposal and any additional information MMS 
deems necessary.
    (4) If your payments for transportation under an arm's-length 
contract are not based on a dollar per unit price,

[[Page 115]]

you must convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price includes a reduction 
for a transportation factor, MMS will not consider the transportation 
factor to be a transportation allowance. You may use the transportation 
factor to determine your gross proceeds for the sale of the product. 
However, the transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base 
price of the product without MMS approval.
    (b) Determining a transportation allowance under a non-arm's-length 
or no contract. (1) This paragraph explains how to determine your 
allowance if you have a non-arm's-length transportation contract or no 
contract.
    (i) When you have a non-arm's-length transportation contract or no 
contract, including those situations where you perform transportation 
services for yourself, the transportation allowance is based upon your 
reasonable, allowable, actual costs for transportation as provided in 
this paragraph.
    (ii) All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length 
or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and 
adjustment. You must submit the actual cost information to support the 
allowance to MMS on Form MMS-4295, Gas Transportation Allowance Report, 
within 3 months after the end of the 12-month period to which the 
allowance applies. However, MMS may approve a longer time period. MMS 
will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure that deductions are 
reasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may require 
you to modify your actual transportation allowance deduction.
    (2) This paragraph explains what actual transportation costs are 
allowable under a non-arm's-length contract or no contract situation. 
The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations is based upon your actual costs for transportation during the 
reporting period. Allowable costs include operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment (in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section), or a cost equal to the initial 
depreciable investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate 
of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed 
assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment) that are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and 
engineering, operations labor, fuel, utilities, materials, ad valorem 
property taxes, rent, supplies, and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense that you can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the 
transportation system, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you 
can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. 
State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, 
including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) You may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated 
capital investment or a return on depreciable capital investment. After 
you have elected to use either method for a transportation system, you 
may not later elect to change to the other alternative without MMS 
approval.
    (A) To compute depreciation, you may elect to use either a straight-
line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life 
of the reserves that the transportation system services, or a unit of 
production method. Once you make an election, you may not change methods 
without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system 
will not alter the depreciation schedule that the original transporter/
lessee established for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or 
without a change in ownership, a transportation system may be 
depreciated only once. Equipment may not be depreciated below a 
reasonable salvage value. To compute a return on undepreciated capital 
investment, you will multiply the undepreciated capital

[[Page 116]]

investment in the transportation system by the rate of return determined 
under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (B) To compute a return on depreciable capital investment, you will 
multiply the initial capital investment in the transportation system by 
the rate of return determined under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. 
No allowance will be provided for depreciation. This alternative will 
apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service after 
March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return is the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is 
applicable and is effective during the reporting period. The rate must 
be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent transportation 
allowance reporting period that is determined under paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section.
    (3) This paragraph explains how to allocate transportation costs to 
each product and transportation system.
    (i) The deduction for transportation costs must be determined based 
on your cost of transporting each product through each individual 
transportation system. If you transport more than one product in a 
gaseous phase, the allocation of costs to each of the products 
transported must be made in a consistent and equitable manner. The 
allocation should be in the same proportion that the volume of each 
product (excluding waste products that have no value) bears to the 
volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products 
that have no value). Except as provided in this paragraph, you may not 
take an allowance for transporting a product that is not royalty bearing 
without MMS approval.
    (ii) As an alternative to the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of 
this section, you may propose to MMS a cost allocation method based on 
the values of the products transported. MMS will approve the method upon 
determining that it meets one of the two following requirements:
    (A) The methodology in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section cannot be 
applied; and
    (B) Your proposal is more reasonable than the method in paragraph 
(b)(3)(i) of this section.
    (4) Your transportation allowance under this paragraph (b) must be 
determined based upon a calendar year or other period if you and MMS 
agree to an alternative.
    (5) If you transport both gaseous and liquid products through the 
same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation procedure 
to MMS. You may use the transportation allowance determined in 
accordance with your proposed allocation procedure until MMS issues its 
determination on the acceptability of the cost allocation. You are 
required to submit all relevant data to support your proposal. MMS will 
then determine the transportation allowance based upon your proposal and 
any additional information MMS deems necessary.
    (c) Using the alternative transportation calculation when you have a 
non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) As an alternative to computing your 
transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of this section, you may 
use as the transportation allowance 10 percent of your gross proceeds 
but not to exceed 30 cents per MMBtu.
    (2) Your election to use the alternative transportation allowance 
calculation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be made at the 
beginning of a month and must remain in effect for an entire calendar 
year. Your first election will remain in effect until the end of the 
succeeding calendar year, except for elections effective January 1 that 
will be effective only for that calendar year.
    (d) Reporting your transportation allowance. (1) If MMS requests, 
you must submit all data used to determine your transportation 
allowance. The data must be provided within a reasonable period of time 
that MMS will determine.
    (2) You must report transportation allowances as a separate line 
item on Form MMS-2014. MMS may approve a different reporting procedure 
on allottee leases, and with lessor approval on tribal leases.

[[Page 117]]

    (e) Adjusting incorrect allowances. If for any month the 
transportation allowance you are entitled to is less than the amount you 
took on Form MMS-2014, you are required to report and pay additional 
royalties due, plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.54 from the first 
day of the first month you deducted the improper transportation 
allowance until the date you pay the royalties due. If the 
transportation allowance you are entitled to is greater than the amount 
you took on Form MMS-2014 for any royalties during the reporting period, 
you are entitled to a credit. No interest will be paid on the 
overpayment.
    (f) Determining allowable costs for transportation allowances. 
Lessees may include, but are not limited to, the following costs in 
determining the arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph 
(a) of this section or the non-arm's-length transportation allowance 
under paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Firm demand charges paid to pipelines. You must limit the 
allowable costs for the firm demand charges to the applicable rate per 
MMBtu multiplied by the actual volumes transported. You may not include 
any losses incurred for previously purchased but unused firm capacity. 
You also may not include any gains associated with releasing firm 
capacity. If you receive a payment or credit from the pipeline for 
penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce 
the firm demand charge claimed on the Form MMS-2014. You must modify the 
Form MMS-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected 
reporting period.
    (2) Gas supply realignment (GSR) costs. The GSR costs result from a 
pipeline reforming or terminating supply contracts with producers to 
implement the restructuring requirements of FERC orders in 18 CFR part 
284.
    (3) Commodity charges. The commodity charge allows the pipeline to 
recover the costs of providing service.
    (4) Wheeling costs. Hub operators charge a wheeling cost for 
transporting gas from one pipeline to either the same or another 
pipeline through a market center or hub. A hub is a connected manifold 
of pipelines through which a series of incoming pipelines are 
interconnected to a series of outgoing pipelines.
    (5) Gas Research Institute (GRI) fees. The GRI conducts research, 
development, and commercialization programs on natural gas related 
topics for the benefit of the U.S. gas industry and gas customers. GRI 
fees are allowable provided such fees are mandatory in FERC-approved 
tariffs.
    (6) Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) fees. FERC charges these fees to 
pipelines to pay for its operating expenses.
    (7) Payments (either volumetric or in value) for actual or 
theoretical losses. This paragraph does not apply to non-arm's-length 
transportation arrangements.
    (8) Temporary storage services. This includes short duration storage 
services offered by market centers or hubs (commonly referred to as 
``parking'' or ``banking''), or other temporary storage services 
provided by pipeline transporters, whether actual or provided as a 
matter of accounting. Temporary storage is limited to 30 days or less.
    (9) Supplemental costs for compression, dehydration, and treatment 
of gas. MMS allows these costs only if such services are required for 
transportation and exceed the services necessary to place production 
into marketable condition required under Sec. 206.174(h).
    (g) Determining nonallowable costs for transportation allowances. 
Lessees may not include the following costs in determining the arm's-
length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section or 
the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of 
this section:
    (1) Fees or costs incurred for storage. This includes storing 
production in a storage facility, whether on or off the lease, for more 
than 30 days.
    (2) Aggregater/marketer fees. This includes fees you pay to another 
person (including your affiliates) to market your gas, including 
purchasing and reselling the gas, or finding or maintaining a market for 
the gas production.
    (3) Penalties you incur as shipper. These penalties include, but are 
not limited to the following:
    (i) Over-delivery cash-out penalties. This includes the difference 
between the price the pipeline pays you for

[[Page 118]]

over-delivered volumes outside the tolerances and the price you receive 
for over-delivered volumes within tolerances.
    (ii) Scheduling penalties. This includes penalties you incur for 
differences between daily volumes delivered into the pipeline and 
volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point.
    (iii) Imbalance penalties. This includes penalties you incur 
(generally on a monthly basis) for differences between volumes delivered 
into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or 
delivery point.
    (iv) Operational penalties. This includes fees you incur for 
violation of the pipeline's curtailment or operational orders issued to 
protect the operational integrity of the pipeline.
    (4) Intra-hub transfer fees. These are fees you pay to hub operators 
for administrative services (e.g., title transfer tracking) necessary to 
account for the sale of gas within a hub.
    (5) Other nonallowable costs. Any cost you incur for services you 
are required to provide at no cost to the lessor.
    (h) Other transportation cost determinations. You must follow the 
provisions of this section to determine transportation costs when 
establishing value using either a net-back valuation procedure or any 
other procedure that allows deduction of actual transportation costs.

                          Processing Allowances


<R05>
Sec. 206.179  What general requirements regarding processing allowances 
apply to me?

    (a) When you value any gas plant product under Sec. 206.174, you 
may deduct from value the reasonable actual costs of processing.
    (b) You must allocate processing costs among the gas plant products. 
You must determine a separate processing allowance for each gas plant 
product and processing plant relationship. Natural gas liquids are 
considered as one product.
    (c) The processing allowance deduction based on an individual 
product may not exceed 66 2/3 percent of the value of each gas plant 
product determined under Sec. 206.174. Before you calculate the 66 2/3 
percent limit, you must first reduce the value for any transportation 
allowances related to post-processing transportation authorized under 
Sec. 206.177.
    (d) Processing cost deductions will not be allowed for placing lease 
products in marketable condition. These costs include among others, 
dehydration, separation, compression upstream of the facility 
measurement point, or storage, even if those functions are performed off 
the lease or at a processing plant. Costs for the removal of acid gases, 
commonly referred to as sweetening, are not allowed unless the acid 
gases removed are further processed into a gas plant product. In such 
event, you will be eligible for a processing allowance determined under 
this subpart. However, MMS will not grant any processing allowance for 
processing lease production that is not royalty bearing.
    (e) You will be allowed a reasonable amount of residue gas royalty 
free for operation of the processing plant, but no allowance will be 
made for expenses incidental to marketing, except as provided in 30 CFR 
part 206. In those situations where a processing plant processes gas 
from more than one lease, only that proportionate share of your residue 
gas necessary for the operation of the processing plant will be allowed 
royalty free.
    (f) You do not owe royalty on residue gas, or any gas plant product 
resulting from processing gas, that is reinjected into a reservoir 
within the same lease, unit, or approved Federal agreement, until such 
time as those products are finally produced from the reservoir for sale 
or other disposition. This paragraph applies only when the reinjection 
is included in a BLM-approved plan of development or operations.
    (g) If MMS determines that you have determined an improper 
processing allowance authorized by this subpart, then you will be 
required to pay any additional royalties plus late payment interest 
determined under 30 CFR 218.54. Alternatively, you may be entitled to a 
credit, but you will not receive any interest on your overpayment.

<R05>
Sec. 206.180  How do I determine an actual processing allowance?

    (a) Determining a processing allowance if you have an arms's-length 
processing contract. (1) This paragraph explains how you determine an 
allowance under an arm's-length processing contract.
    (i) The processing allowance is the reasonable actual costs you 
incur to process the gas under that contract. Paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and 
(iii) of this section provide a limited exception. You have the burden 
of demonstrating that your contract is arm's-length. You are required to 
submit to MMS a copy of your arm's-length contract(s) and all subsequent 
amendments to the contract(s) within 2 months of the date MMS receives 
your first report that deducts the allowance on the Form MMS-2014.
    (ii) When MMS conducts reviews and audits, we will examine whether 
the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from you to the processor for the 
processing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration, 
then MMS may require that the processing allowance be determined under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-
length processing contract does not reflect the value of the processing 
because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because 
you otherwise have breached your duty to the lessor to market the 
production for the mutual benefit of you and the lessor, then MMS will 
require that the processing allowance be determined under paragraph (b) 
of this section. In these circumstances, MMS will notify you and give 
you an opportunity to provide written information justifying your 
processing costs.
    (2) If your arm's-length processing contract includes more than one 
gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product 
can be determined from the contract, then the processing costs for each 
gas plant product must be determined in accordance with the contract. 
You may not take an allowance for the costs of processing lease 
production that is not royalty-bearing.
    (3) If your arm's-length processing contract includes more than one 
gas plant product and the processing costs attributable to each product 
cannot be determined from the contract, you must propose an allocation 
procedure to MMS. You may use your proposed allocation procedure until 
MMS issues its determination. You are required to submit all relevant 
data to support your proposal. MMS will then determine the processing 
allowance based upon your proposal and any additional information MMS 
deems necessary. You may not take a processing allowance for the costs 
of processing lease production that is not royalty-bearing.
    (4) If your payments for processing under an arm's-length contract 
are not based on a dollar per unit price, you must convert whatever 
consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes of 
this section.
    (b) Determining a processing allowance if you have a non-arm's-
length contract or no contract. (1) This paragraph applies if you have a 
non-arm's-length processing contract or no contract, including those 
situations where you perform processing for yourself.
    (i) If you have a non-arm's-length contract or no contract, the 
processing allowance is based upon your reasonable actual costs of 
processing as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (ii) All processing allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or 
no-contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and 
adjustment. You must submit the actual cost information to support the 
allowance to MMS on Form MMS-4109, Gas Processing Allowance Summary 
Report, within 3 months after the end of the 12-month period for which 
the allowance applies. MMS may approve a longer time period. MMS will 
monitor the allowance deduction to ensure that deductions are reasonable 
and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may require you to 
modify your processing allowance.
    (2) The processing allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations is based upon your actual costs for processing during the 
reporting period. Allowable costs include operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and

[[Page 120]]

either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment (in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section), or a cost 
equal to the initial depreciable investment in the processing plant 
multiplied by a rate of return in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally 
those costs for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery 
and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the 
processing plant.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and 
engineering, operations labor, fuel, utilities, materials, ad valorem 
property taxes, rent, supplies, and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense that the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the 
processing plant, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and other 
directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can 
document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the processing plant is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are 
not allowable expenses.
    (iv) You may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciable 
capital investment or a return on depreciable capital investment. After 
you elect to use either method for a processing plant, you may not later 
elect to change to the other alternative without MMS approval.
    (A) To compute depreciation, you may elect to use either a straight-
line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life 
of the reserves that the processing plant services, or a unit-of-
production method. Once you make an election, you may not change methods 
without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a processing plant will 
not alter the depreciation schedule that the original processor/lessee 
established for purposes of the allowance calculation. However, for 
processing plants you or your affiliate purchase that do not have a 
previously claimed MMS depreciation schedule, you may treat the 
processing plant as a newly installed facility for depreciation 
purposes. A processing plant may be depreciated only once, regardless of 
whether there is a change in ownership. Equipment may not be depreciated 
below a reasonable salvage value. To compute a return on undepreciated 
capital investment, you must multiply the undepreciable capital 
investment in the processing plant by the rate of return determined 
under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (B) To compute a return on depreciable capital investment, you must 
multiply the initial capital investment in the processing plant by the 
rate of return determined under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No 
allowance will be provided for depreciation. This alternative will apply 
only to plants first placed in service after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return is the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3) Your processing allowance under this paragraph (b) must be 
determined based upon a calendar year or other period if you and MMS 
agree to an alternative.
    (4) The processing allowance for each gas plant product must be 
determined based on your reasonable and actual cost of processing the 
gas. You must base your allocation of costs to each gas plant product 
upon generally accepted accounting principles. You may not take an 
allowance for the costs of processing lease production that is not 
royalty-bearing.
    (c) Reporting your processing allowance. (1) If MMS requests, you 
must submit all data used to determine your processing allowance. The 
data must be provided within a reasonable period of time, as MMS 
determines.
    (2) You must report gas processing allowances as a separate line 
item on the Form MMS-2014. MMS may approve a different reporting 
procedure for allottee leases, and with lessor approval on tribal 
leases.

[[Page 121]]

    (d) Adjusting incorrect processing allowances. If for any month the 
gas processing allowance you are entitled to is less than the amount you 
took on Form MMS-2014, you are required to pay additional royalties, 
plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.54 from the first day of the 
first month you deducted a processing allowance until the date you pay 
the royalties due. If the processing allowance you are entitled is 
greater than the amount you took on Form MMS-2014, you are entitled to a 
credit. However, no interest will be paid on the overpayment.
    (e) Other processing cost determinations. You must follow the 
provisions of this section to determine processing costs when 
establishing value using either a net-back valuation procedure or any 
other procedure that requires deduction of actual processing costs.


<R05>
Sec. 206.181  How do I establish processing costs for dual accounting 
purposes when I do not process the gas?

    Where accounting for comparison (dual accounting) is required for 
gas production from a lease but neither you nor someone acting on your 
behalf processes the gas, and you have elected to perform actual dual 
accounting under Sec. 206.176, you must use the first applicable of the 
following methods to establish processing costs for dual accounting 
purposes:
    (a) The average of the costs established in your current arm's-
length processing agreements for gas from the lease, provided that some 
gas has previously been processed under these agreements.
    (b) The average of the costs established in your current arm's-
length processing agreements for gas from the lease, provided that the 
agreements are in effect for plants to which the lease is physically 
connected and under which gas from other leases in the field or area is 
being or has been processed.
    (c) A proposed comparable processing fee submitted to either the 
tribe and MMS (for tribal leases) or MMS (for allotted leases) with your 
supporting documentation submitted to MMS. If MMS does not take action 
on your proposal within 120 days, the proposal will be deemed to be 
denied and subject to appeal to the MMS Director under 30 CFR part 290.
    (d) Processing costs based on the regulations in Sec. Sec. 206.179 
and 206.180.

Sec. 206.250  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all coal produced from Federal 
coal leases. The purpose of this subpart is to establish the value of 
coal produced for royalty purposes, of all coal from Federal leases 
consistent with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws and 
lease terms.
    (b) If the specific provisions of any statute or settlement 
agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from 
administrative or judicial litigation, or any coal lease subject to the 
requirements of this subpart, are inconsistent with any regulation in 
this subpart then the statute, lease provision, or settlement shall 
govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) All royalty payments made to the Minerals Management Service 
(MMS) are subject to later audit and adjustment.

Sec. 206.251  Definitions.

    Ad valorem lease means a lease where the royalty due to the lessor 
is based upon a percentage of the amount or value of the coal.
    Allowance means a deduction used in determining value for royalty 
purposes. Coal washing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, 
actual costs incurred by the lessee for coal washing. Transportation 
allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred 
by the lessee for moving coal to a point of sale or point of delivery 
remote from both the lease and mine or wash plant.
    Area means a geographic region in which coal has similar quality and 
economic characteristics. Area boundaries

[[Page 122]]

are not officially designated and the areas are not necessarily named.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes 
of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For 
purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the 
voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership:
    (a) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;
    (b) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of 
control; and
    (c) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of 
noncontrol which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal 
control, including the existence of interlocking directorates.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between 
relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length 
contracts. The MMS may require the lessee to certify ownership control. 
To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must 
meet the requirements of this definition for that production month as 
well as when the contract was executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Coal means coal of all ranks from lignite through anthracite.
    Coal washing means any treatment to remove impurities from coal. 
Coal washing may include, but is not limited to, operations such as 
flotation, air, water, or heavy media separation; drying; and related 
handling (or combination thereof).
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to a coal lessee for the production and 
disposition of the coal produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not 
limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as 
crushing, sizing, screening, storing, mixing, loading, treatment with 
substances including chemicals or oils, and other preparation of the 
coal to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no 
cost to the Federal Government. Gross proceeds, as applied to coal, also 
includes but is not limited to reimbursements for royalties, taxes or 
fees, and other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross 
proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Federal royalty interest 
may be exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including 
the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a 
lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek 
to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States for a Federal 
coal resource under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration 
for, development or extraction of, or removal of coal--or the land 
covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, 
and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or 
other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has 
an interest in a lease as well as an operator or payor who has no 
interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment 
responsibility.
    Like-quality coal means coal that has similar chemical and physical 
characteristics.
    Marketable condition means coal that is sufficiently free from 
impurities and otherwise in a condition that it will be accepted by a 
purchaser under a sales contract typical for that area.

[[Page 123]]

    Mine means an underground or surface excavation or series of 
excavations and the surface or underground support facilities that 
contribute directly or indirectly to mining, production, preparation, 
and handling of lease products.
    Net-back method means a method for calculating market value of coal 
at the lease or mine. Under this method, costs of transportation, 
washing, handling, etc., are deducted from the ultimate proceeds 
received for the coal at the first point at which reasonable values for 
the coal may be determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract or by comparison to other sales of coal, to ascertain value at 
the mine.
    Net output means the quantity of washed coal that a washing plant 
produces.
    Netting is the deduction of an allowance from the sales value by 
reporting a one line net sales value, instead of correctly reporting the 
deduction as a separate line item on the Form MMS-4430.
    Person means by individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of coal are made to a purchaser.
    Spot market price means the price received under any sales 
transaction when planned or actual deliveries span a short period of 
time, usually not exceeding one year.

Sec. 206.253  Coal subject to royalties--general provisions.

    (a) All coal (except coal unavoidably lost as determined by BLM 
under 43 CFR part 3400) from a Federal lease subject to this part is 
subject to royalty. This includes coal used, sold, or otherwise disposed 
of by the lessee on or off the lease.
    (b) If a lessee receives compensation for unavoidably lost coal 
through insurance coverage or other arrangements, royalties at the rate 
specified in the lease are to be paid on the amount of compensation 
received for the coal. No royalty is due on insurance compensation 
received by the lessee for other losses.
    (c) If waste piles or slurry ponds are reworked to recover coal, the 
lessee shall pay royalty at the rate specified in the lease at the time 
the recovered coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. The 
royalty rate shall be that rate applicable to the production method used 
to initially mine coal in the waste pile or slurry pond; i.e., 
underground mining method or surface mining method. Coal in waste pits 
or slurry ponds initially mined from Federal leases shall be allocated 
to such leases regardless of whether it is stored on Federal lands. The 
lessee shall maintain accurate records to determine to which individual 
Federal lease coal in the waste pit or slurry pond should be allocated. 
However, nothing in this section requires payment of a royalty on coal 
for which a royalty has already been paid.

Sec. 206.254  Quality and quantity measurement standards for reporting 
and paying royalties.

    For all leases subject to this subpart, the quantity of coal on 
which royalty is due shall be measured in short tons (of 2,000 pounds 
each) by methods prescribed by the BLM. Coal quantity information shall 
be reported on appropriate forms required under 30 CFR part 216 and on 
the Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report, Form MMS-4430, as 
required under 30 CFR part 210.

basis of the quantity and quality of Federal coal in marketable 
condition measured at the point of royalty measurement as determined 
jointly by BLM and MMS.
    (b) Coal produced and added to stockpiles or inventory does not 
require payment of royalty until such coal is later used, sold, or 
otherwise finally disposed of. MMS may ask BLM to increase the lease 
bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that 
stockpiles or inventory become excessive so as to increase the risk of 
degradation of the resource.
    (c) The lessee shall pay royalty at a rate specified in the lease at 
the time the coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, 
unless otherwise provided for at Sec. 206.256(d) of this subpart.

Sec. 206.256  Valuation standards for cents-per-ton leases.

    (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Federal lands which 
provide for the determination of royalty on a cents-per-ton (or other 
quantity) basis.
    (b) The royalty for coal from leases subject to this section shall 
be based on the dollar rate per ton prescribed in the lease. That dollar 
rate shall be applicable to the actual quantity of coal used, sold, or 
otherwise finally disposed of, including coal which is avoidably lost as 
determine by BLM pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400.
    (c) For leases subject to this section, there shall be no allowances 
for transportation, removal of impurities, coal washing, or any other 
processing or preparation of the coal.
    (d) When a coal lease is readjusted pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400 and 
the royalty valuation method changes from a cents-per-ton basis to an ad 
valorem basis, coal which is produced prior to the effective date of 
readjustment and sold or used within 30 days of the effective date of 
readjustment shall be valued pursuant to this section. All coal that is 
not used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of within 30 days after 
the effective date of readjustment shall be valued pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 206.257 of this subpart, and royalties shall be paid 
at the royalty rate specified in the readjusted lease.

<R05>
Sec. 206.257  Valuation standards for ad valorem leases.

    (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Federal lands which 
provide for the determination of royalty as a percentage of the amount 
of value of coal (ad valorem). The value for royalty purposes of coal 
from such leases shall be the value of coal determined under this 
section, less applicable coal washing allowances and transportation 
allowances determined under Sec. Sec. 206.258 through 206.262 of this 
subpart, or any allowance authorized by Sec. 206.265 of this subpart. 
The royalty due shall be equal to the value for royalty purposes 
multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
    (b)(1) The value of coal that is sold pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(5) of this section. The 
lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is 
arm's-length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, 
is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the coal 
produced. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, then 
the MMS may require that the coal sold pursuant to that contract be 
valued in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not 
be based on less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the 
coal production, including the additional consideration.
    (3) If the MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between 
the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached 
its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit 
of the lessee and the lessor, then

[[Page 125]]

MMS shall require that the coal production be valued pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, and in 
accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of 
this section. When MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, 
MMS will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's reported coal value.
    (4) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the coal production.
    (5) The value of production for royalty purposes shall not include 
payments received by the lessee pursuant to a contract which the lessee 
demonstrates, to MMS's satisfaction, were not part of the total 
consideration paid for the purchase of coal production.
    (c)(1) The value of coal from leases subject to this section and 
which is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be 
determined in accordance with this section.
    (2) If the value of the coal cannot be determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, then the value shall be determined 
through application of other valuation criteria. The criteria shall be 
considered in the following order, and the value shall be based upon the 
first applicable criterion:
    (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition of produced 
coal by other than an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross 
proceeds are within the range of the gross proceeds derived from, or 
paid under, comparable arm's-length contracts between buyers and sellers 
neither of whom is affiliated with the lessee for sales, purchases, or 
other dispositions of like-quality coal produced in the area. In 
evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes 
of these regulations, the following factors shall be considered: Price, 
time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of 
coal, quantity, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect 
the value of the coal;
    (ii) Prices reported for that coal to a public utility commission;
    (iii) Prices reported for that coal to the Energy Information 
Administration of the Department of Energy;
    (iv) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published 
or publicly available spot market prices, or information submitted by 
the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease 
operation or the saleability of certain types of coal;
    (v) If a reasonable value cannot be determined using paragraphs 
(c)(2) (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, then a net-back method 
or any other reasonable method shall be used to determine value.
    (3) When the value of coal is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, that value determination shall be consistent 
with the provisions contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (d)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, that value does not require MMS's prior approval. However, 
the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of 
royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMS 
will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the 
reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or State representatives, to the Inspector General of the 
Department of the Interior or other persons authorized to receive such 
information, arm's-length sales value and sales quantity data for like-
quality coal sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from 
the area.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraphs (c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section. The 
notification shall be by letter to the Associate Director for Minerals 
Revenue Management of his/her designee. The letter shall identify the 
valuation method to be used and contain a brief description of the 
procedure to be followed. The notification required by this section is a 
one-time notification due no later than the month the lessee first 
reports royalties

[[Page 126]]

on the Form MMS-4430 using a valuation method authorized by paragraphs 
(c)(2) (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section, and each time there is 
a change in a method under paragraphs (c)(2) (iv) or (v) of this 
section.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall be liable for the difference, if any, between 
royalty payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty 
payments that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The 
lessee shall also be liable for interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.202. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based 
upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. That determination shall remain effective for the period 
stated therein. After MMS issues its determination, the lessee shall 
make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value for royalty purposes be less than the 
gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the disposition of produced 
coal less applicable provisions of paragraph (b)(5) of this section and 
less applicable allowances determined pursuant to Sec. Sec. 206.258 
through 206.262 and Sec. 206.265 of this subpart.
    (h) The lessee is required to place coal in marketable condition at 
no cost to the Federal Government. Where the value established under 
this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value 
shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds has been 
reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain 
services, the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the 
lessee to place the coal in marketable condition.
    (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract, and may be retroactively applied to 
value for royalty purposes for a period not to exceed two years, unless 
MMS approves a longer period. If the lessee makes timely application for 
a price increase allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, 
and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force 
purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional royalties unless 
or until monies or consideration resulting from the price increase are 
received. This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to 
avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser 
fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of coal.
    (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Federal Government 
or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation, coal washing, or other allowances 
under Sec. 206.265 of this subpart, is exempted from disclosure by the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 522. Any data specified by the Act 
to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt shall be maintained 
in a confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. All requests for information about determinations made 
under this part are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act

Sec. 206.258  Washing allowances--general.

    (a) For ad valorem leases subject to Sec. 206.257 of this subpart, 
MMS shall, as authorized by this section, allow a deduction in 
determining value for royalty purposes for the reasonable, actual costs 
incurred to wash coal, unless the value determined pursuant to Sec. 
206.257 of this subpart was based upon like-quality unwashed coal. Under 
no circumstances will the authorized washing allowance and the 
transportation allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.
    (b) If MMS determines that a lessee has improperly determined a 
washing allowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall be 
liable for any additional royalties, plus interest determined in 
accordance with 30 CFR 218.202, or shall be entitled to a credit without 
interest.
    (c) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate washing costs to 
Federal leases.
    (d) No cost normally associated with mining operations and which are 
necessary for placing coal in marketable condition shall be allowed as a 
cost of washing.
    (e) Coal washing costs shall only be recognized as allowances when 
the washed coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.

FR 43288, Aug. 10, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 206.259  Determination of washing allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For washing costs incurred by a 
lessee under an arm's-length contract, the washing allowance shall be 
the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee for washing the coal 
under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible 
future adjustment. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating 
that its contract is arm's-length. MMS' prior approval is not required 
before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length 
contract. The lessee must claim a washing allowance by reporting it as a 
separate line entry on the Form MMS-4430.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the washer for the 
washing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration 
paid, then the MMS may require that the washing allowance be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length washing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of 
the washing because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, 
or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to 
market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the 
lessor, then MMS shall require that the washing allowance be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS determines 
that the value of the washing may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's washing costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for washing under an arm's-length 
contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent. 
Washing allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal washed.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations 
where the lessee performs washing for itself, the washing allowance will 
be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All washing 
allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation 
are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future 
adjustment. The lessee must claim a washing allowance by reporting it as 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-4430. When

[[Page 128]]

necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its 
estimated or actual washing allowance.
    (2) The washing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for washing 
during the reported period, including operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) 
(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable investment in 
the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are 
generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of 
delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integral 
part of the wash plant.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes, rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the wash 
plant; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly 
allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can 
document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the wash plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal 
income taxes and severance taxes, including royalities, are not 
allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B) of this 
section. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a wash 
plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative 
without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the wash plant services, whichever is 
appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, 
the lessee may not change methods without MMS approval. A change in 
ownership of a wash plant shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original operator/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a wash 
plant shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated 
below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
capital investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance 
shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to 
plants first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.
    (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3) The washing allowance for coal shall be determined based on the 
lessee's reasonable and actual cost of washing the coal. The lessee may 
not take an allowance for the costs of washing lease production that is 
not royalty bearing.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) The 
lessee must notify MMS of an allowance based on incurred costs by using 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-4430.
    (ii) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length washing 
contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a 
reasonable time, as determined by MMS.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) The lessee must notify MMS 
of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-4430.
    (ii) For new washing facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial washing deduction shall include estimates of the allowable coal 
washing costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be based 
upon the most recently available operations data for the washing system 
or, if such data are not

[[Page 129]]

available, the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for 
similar washing systems.
    (iii) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a washing 
allowance on the Form MMS-4430, then the lessee shall be assessed an 
amount up to 10 percent of the allowance netted not to exceed $250 per 
lease selling arrangement per sales period.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a washing allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual coal washing allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-4430 for each month 
during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay additional 
royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.202 from the date 
when the lessee took the deduction to the date the lessee repays the 
difference to MMS. If the actual washing allowance is greater than the 
amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-4430 for each month during the 
allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit 
without interest.
    (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-4430 to reflect 
actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Other washing cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine washing costs when establishing value 
using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of washing costs.

Sec. 206.260  Allocation of washed coal.

    (a) When coal is subjected to washing, the washed coal must be 
allocated to the leases from which it was extracted.
    (b) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from 
coal obtained from only one lease, the quantity of washed coal allocable 
to the lease will be based on the net output of the washing plant.
    (c) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from 
coal obtained from more than one lease, unless determined otherwise by 
BLM, the quantity of net output of washed coal allocable to each lease 
will be based on the ratio of measured quantities of coal delivered to 
the washing plant and washed from each lease compared to the total 
measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed.


<R05>
Sec. 206.261  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) For ad valorem leases subject to Sec. 206.257 of this subpart, 
where the value for royalty purposes has been determined at a point 
remote from the lease or mine, MMS shall, as authorized by this section, 
allow a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes for the 
reasonable, actual costs incurred to:
    (1) Transport the coal from a Federal lease to a sales point which 
is remote from both the lease and mine; or
    (2) Transport the coal from a Federal lease to a wash plant when 
that plant is remote from both the lease and mine and, if applicable, 
from the wash plant to a remote sales point. In-mine transportation 
costs shall not be included in the transportation allowance.
    (b) Under no circumstances will the authorized washing allowance and 
the transportation allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes to 
zero.
    (c)(1) When coal transported from a mine to a wash plant is eligible 
for a transportation allowance in accordance with this section, the 
lessee is not required to allocate transportation costs between the 
quantity of clean coal output and the rejected waste material. The 
transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total production 
which is transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a 
cost per ton of cleaned coal transported.

[[Page 130]]

    (2) For coal that is not washed at a wash plant, the transportation 
allowance shall be authorized for the total production which is 
transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per 
ton of coal transported.
    (3) Transportation costs shall only be recognized as allowances when 
the transported coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
section, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest, determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest.
    (e) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate transportation 
costs to Federal leases.

FR 43288, Aug. 10, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 206.262  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For transportation costs incurred by 
a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation 
allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee 
for transporting the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, 
review, audit, and possible future adjustment. The lessee shall have the 
burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The lessee 
must claim a transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line 
entry on the Form MMS-4430.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration paid, then the MMS may require that the transportation 
allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (3) If the MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable 
value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee 
shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract--(1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations 
where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the 
transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable 
actual costs. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-
length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, 
audit, and possible future adjustment. The lessee must claim a 
transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate line entry on the 
Form MMS-4430. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its estimated or actual transportation allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable 
investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets 
(including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) 
which are

[[Page 131]]

an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including 
royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either 
method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to 
change to the other alternative without approval of the MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, 
whichever is appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an 
election is made, the lessee may not change methods without MMS 
approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not 
alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/
lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a 
change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only 
once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage 
value.
    (B) The MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate 
of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(B)(v) of this section. 
No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall 
apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service or 
acquired after March 1, 1989.
    (v) The rate of return must be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return must be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
    (3) A lessee may apply to MMS for exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section. MMS will grant the exception only if the lessee 
has a rate for the transportation approved by a Federal agency or by a 
State regulatory agency (for Federal leases). MMS shall deny the 
exception request if it determines that the rate is excessive as 
compared to arm's-length transportation charges by systems, owned by the 
lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in that 
area. If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, MMS shall 
deny the exception request if:
    (i) No Federal or State regulatory agency costs analysis exists and 
the Federal or State regulatory agency, as applicable, has declined to 
investigate under MMS timely objections upon filing; and
    (ii) The rate significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation as determined under this section.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) The 
lessee must notify MMS of an allowance based on incurred costs by using 
a separate line entry on the Form MMS-4430.
    (ii) The MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract--(i) The lessee must notify MMS 
of an allowance based on the incurred costs by using a separate line 
entry on Form MMS-4430.
    (ii) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial deduction shall include estimates of the

[[Page 132]]

allowable coal transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost 
estimates shall be based upon the most recently available operations 
data for the transportation system or, if such data are not available, 
the lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar 
transportation systems.
    (iii) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare the allowance deduction. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (iv) If the lessee is authorized to use its Federal- or State-
agency-approved rate as its transportation cost in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it shall follow the reporting 
requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Interest and assessments. (1) If a lessee nets a transportation 
allowance on Form MMS-4430, the lessee shall be assessed an amount of up 
to 10 percent of the allowance netted not to exceed $250 per lease 
selling arrangement per sales period.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual coal transportation allowance is 
less than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-4430 for each 
month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall pay 
additional royalties due plus interest computed under 30 CFR 218.202 
from the date when the lessee took the deduction to the date the lessee 
repays the difference to MMS. If the actual transportation allowance is 
greater than amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-4430 for each month 
during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a 
credit without interest.
    (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-4430 to reflect 
actual costs, together with any payments, in accordance with

    (f) Other transportation cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing 
value using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of transportation costs.

That where the authorized officer determines:
    (1) That a contract of sale or other business arrangement between 
the lessee and a purchaser of some or all of the commodities produced

parties because it is based in whole or in part upon considerations 
other than the value of the commodities, or
    (2) That no bona fide sales price is received for some or all of 
such commodities because the lessee is consuming them, the authorized 
officer shall determine their gross value, taking into account: (i) All 
prices received by the lessee in all bona fide transactions, (ii) Prices 
paid for commodities of like quality produced from the same general 
area, and (iii) Such other relevant factors as the authorized officer 
may deem appropriate; and Provided further, That in a situation where an 
estimated value is used, the authorized officer shall require the 
payment of such additional royalties, or allow such credits or refunds 
as may be necessary to adjust royalty payment to reflect the actual 
gross value.
    (b) The lessee is required to certify that the values reported for 
royalty purposes are bona fide sales not involving considerations other 
than the sale of the mineral, and he may be required by the authorized 
officer to supply supporting information.

    Source: 56 FR 57276, Nov. 8, 1991, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 206.350  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart is applicable to all geothermal resources produced 
from Federal geothermal leases issued pursuant to the Geothermal Steam 
Act of 1970, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.). The purpose of this 
subpart is to establish the value of geothermal production for royalty 
purposes.
    (b) All royalty payments made to MMS are subject to audit and 
adjustment.


<R05>
Sec. 206.351  Definitions.

    For purposes of this subpart:
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes 
of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with, another person. For 
purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the 
voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership:
    (1) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control;
    (2) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a rebuttable 
presumption of control; and
    (3) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of 
noncontrol which MMS may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal 
control, including the existence of interlocking directorates.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between 
relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length 
contracts. The MMS may require the lessee to certify the claimed nature 
of ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for any production 
month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for the 
production month as well as when the contract was executed.
    Audit means a procedure having the same meaning and effect as that 
described at 30 CFR part 217 for verifying royalty payment compliance 
activities of lessees or other authorized persons who pay royalties, 
rents, or bonuses on Federal geothermal leases.
    Byproduct means:

[[Page 134]]

    (1) Any mineral or minerals (exclusive of oil, hydrocarbon gas, and 
helium) which are found in solution or developed in association with 
geothermal fluids and which have a value of less than 75 per centum of 
the value of the geothermal energy or are not, because of quantity, 
quality, or technical difficulties in extraction and production, of 
sufficient value to warrant extraction and production by themselves, and
    (2) Commercially demineralized water.
    Byproduct recovery facility means the facility or facilities at 
which byproducts are placed in marketable condition.
    Byproduct transportation allowance means an approved allowance for 
the lessee's reasonable, actual costs, excluding gathering, incurred for 
moving byproducts, including commercially demineralized water, to a 
point of sale or point of delivery off the lease, unit area, or 
communitized area.
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Deduction means a subtraction used in the geothermal netback 
procedure for determining the value of geothermal resources utilized by 
the lessee to generate electricity. Transmission deduction means a 
deduction for the lessee's reasonable actual costs incurred to wheel or 
transmit the electricity from the lessee's powerplant to the purchaser's 
delivery point. Generating deduction means a deduction for the lessee's 
reasonable, actual costs of generating plant tailgate electricity.
    Delivered electricity means the amount of electricity in 
kilowatthours delivered to the purchaser.
    Direct utilization means any process other than electrical 
generation in which the thermal energy of the geothermal resource is 
utilized, including, but not limited to, space heating, greenhouse 
operations, and industrial or agricultural process heat.
    Field means the land surface vertically projected over a subsurface 
geothermal reservoir encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of 
all geothermal accumulations known to be within that reservoir. 
Geothermal fields are usually given names and their official boundaries 
are often designated by regulatory agencies in the respective States in 
which the fields are located.
    Gathering means the efficient movement of lease production from the 
wellhead to the point of utilization.
    Geothermal netback procedure means the method of determining the 
value of geothermal resources that are utilized in a lessee-owned 
powerplant for the generation and sale of electricity by deducting the 
lessee's reasonable, actual transmission and generating costs from the 
sales price or value of the electricity to derive the value of the 
geothermal resource at the powerplant inlet.
    Geothermal resources means:
    (1) All products of geothermal processes, including indigenous 
steam, hot water, and hot brines;
    (2) Steam and other gases, hot water, and hot brines resulting from 
water, gas, or other fluids artificially introduced into geothermal 
formations;
    (3) Heat or other associated energy found in geothermal formations; 
and
    (4) Any byproducts.
    Geothermal utilization facility means a powerplant or direct 
utilization facility that utilizes the heat or other energy of the 
geothermal resource.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty purposes) means the total monies and 
other consideration accruing to a geothermal lessee for any disposition 
of geothermal resources, including total payments for the sale of 
electricity generated by the lessee from lease-produced geothermal 
resources. Gross proceeds includes, but is not limited to, payments to 
the lessee for certain services such as effluent injection, field 
operation and maintenance, drilling or workover of wells, and/or field 
gathering to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at 
no cost to the Federal Government. Gross proceeds also includes, but is 
not limited to, reimbursements for production taxes and other taxes. Tax 
reimbursements are part of gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even 
though the Federal royalty interest may be exempt from

[[Page 135]]

taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the forms of 
consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee is 
contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to collect 
through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Lease means a geothermal lease issued under authority of the 
Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended (30 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), 
unless the context indicates otherwise.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a 
geothermal lease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to 
make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This includes any 
person who has an interest in a geothermal lease as well as an operator 
or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the 
royalty payment responsibility. This also includes any affiliate of the 
lessee that utilizes the geothermal resource to generate electricity, in 
a direct utilization process, or to recover byproducts, or any affiliate 
that transports lease production.
    Like-quality lease products means lease products that have similar 
chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
    Marketable condition means lease products that are sufficiently free 
from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be accepted 
by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field.
    Minimum royalty means the minimum amount of annual royalty as 
specified in the lease or in applicable leasing regulations that the 
lessee must pay after commencement of geothermal production in 
commercial quantities.
    No sales means the utilization or disposal of geothermal resources 
without the benefit of a sale.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a 
separate entity).
    Plant tailgate electricity means the amount of electricity in 
kilowatthours generated by the powerplant exclusive of plant parasitic 
electricity, but inclusive of any electricity generated by the 
powerplant and returned to the lease for lease operations. Plant 
tailgate electricity should be measured at, or calculated for, the high 
voltage side of the transformer in the plant switchyard.
    Point of utilization means the powerplant or direct utilization 
facility in which the geothermal resource (steam or hot water) is 
utilized.
    Reasonable alternative fuel means a conventional fuel (such as coal, 
oil, gas, or wood) that would normally be used as a source of heat in 
direct utilization operations.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the Department of the Interior or 
any person duly authorized to exercise the powers vested in that office.
    Selling arrangement means the individually contracted arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of geothermal resources are made, 
including sales or dispositions of byproducts and electricity sales 
where the lessee generates electricity from lease geothermal production.
    Spot market price means the price received under any sales 
transaction when planned or actual deliveries span a short period of 
time, usually not exceeding 1 year.
    Wheeling means the transmission of electricity from a powerplant to 
the point of delivery.


<R05>
Sec. 206.352  Valuation standards for electrical generation.

    (a) The value of geothermal resources produced from leases subject 
to this subpart and used to generate electricity shall be determined 
pursuant to this section.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of geothermal resources that are sold pursuant 
to an arm's-length contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either 
directly or indirectly, from the buyer to the seller for the geothermal 
resource. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, MMS 
may require that the

[[Page 136]]

geothermal resource sold pursuant to that contract be valued in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Value shall not be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including any additional 
consideration received.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between 
the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached 
its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit 
of the lessee and the lessor, MMS shall require the geothermal resource 
to be valued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, and notification 
provided to MMS in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section. If 
MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's value.
    (2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that the provisions in 
its arm's-length contract include all of the consideration to be paid by 
the buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the geothermal resource.
    (c)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section 
that are sold under a non-arm's-length contract shall be determined in 
accordance with the first applicable of the following paragraphs:
    (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract provided that those gross proceeds 
are not less than the gross proceeds derived from or paid under the 
lowest-priced available comparable arm's-length contract for sales of 
geothermal resources to the lessee-affiliate's same powerplant (the 
``minimum value''). If the gross proceeds under the lessee's non-arm's-
length contract are less than the ``minimum value'' under available 
comparable arm's-length contracts, or if there are no available 
comparable arm's-length contracts, value will be determined by the 
weighted average of the gross proceeds established under arm's-length 
contracts for the sale of significant quantities of geothermal resources 
to the same powerplant. Available contracts will mean contracts in the 
possession of the lessee, the lessee's affiliate, or MMS. In evaluating 
the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these 
regulations, the following factors shall be considered: Time of 
execution, duration, terms, quality of the geothermal resource, volume, 
dedication to the same powerplant, and other factors that may be 
appropriate to reflect the value of the resource;
    (ii) The value determined by the geothermal netback procedure. Under 
the geothermal netback procedure, the lessee's reasonable actual costs 
for the generation and transmission of electricity shall be deducted 
from the lessee's gross proceeds received for the sale of electricity to 
determine the value of the geothermal resource. Transmission deductions 
shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 206.353 of this part. Generating 
deductions shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 206.354 of this part; 
or
    (iii) A value determined by any other reasonable valuation method 
approved by MMS.
    (2) Value determinations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject 
to the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section 
that are not subject to a sales transaction (``no sales'' geothermal 
resources) but are instead utilized directly by the lessee in its own 
powerplant for the generation and sale of electricity shall be 
determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following 
paragraphs:
    (i) The weighted average of the gross proceeds established in arm's-
length contracts for the purchase of significant quantities of 
geothermal resources to operate the lessee's same powerplant. In 
evaluating the acceptability of arm's-length contracts, the following 
factors shall be considered: Time of execution, duration, terms, volume, 
quality of resource, and such other factors as may be appropriate to 
reflect the value of the resource;
    (ii) The value determined by the geothermal netback procedure. Under 
the geothermal netback procedure, the lessee's reasonable actual costs 
for the

[[Page 137]]

generation and transmission of electricity shall be deducted from the 
lessee's gross proceeds received for the sale of electricity to 
determine the value of the geothermal resource. Transmission deductions 
shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 206.353 of this part. Generating 
deductions shall be determined pursuant to Sec. 206.354 of this part; 
or
    (iii) A value determined by any other reasonable valuation method 
approved by MMS.
    (2) Value determinations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject 
to the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e)(1) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee shall 
retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value, 
particularly where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) or 
(d) of this section. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and 
MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that 
the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Upon request, lessees shall make available to authorized MMS 
representatives or to other authorized persons any and all contracts for 
the sale or other disposition of the lease production; contracts for the 
sale, generation, and/or transmission of electricity attributable to 
lease production; and any arm's-length sales and other data for like-
quality production sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee 
from the field as may be necessary to support a value determination.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to the MMS Associate Director for Minerals Revenue Management or 
his/her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be 
used and contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. 
The notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification 
due no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee 
first reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method 
authorized by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.302. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that method in determining value, for royalty purposes, until 
MMS issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data 
relevant to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the 
value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information 
MMS deems necessary. In making a value determination, MMS may use any of 
the valuation criteria consistent with this subpart. That determination 
shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues 
its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance 
with paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee where geothermal 
resources are directly sold.
    (i) The lessee is required to place geothermal resources in 
marketable condition and to deliver geothermal resources to the 
powerplant at no cost to the Federal lessor. Where the value established 
pursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, 
that value shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds have 
been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing 
certain services the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of 
the lessee to place the geothermal resource in marketable condition or 
deliver it to the powerplant.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive

[[Page 138]]

through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent contract 
revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or timely 
action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it must 
pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to the contract. If the lessee makes timely application for a 
price increase or benefit allowed under its contract but the purchaser 
refuses and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, 
to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional 
royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting from the 
price increase or additional benefits are received. This paragraph shall 
not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment 
obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in 
part or timely, for a quantity of geothermal resources.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Federal Government 
or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support value 
determinations is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this 
subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulations of the Department, 43 CFR part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 206.353  Determination of transmission deductions.

    (a) Where the value of geothermal energy is determined by the 
geothermal netback procedure pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(d)(1)(ii) of Sec. 206.352 of this subpart, a transmission deduction 
shall be subtracted from the lessee's gross proceeds received for the 
sale of electricity to determine the plant tailgate value of the 
electricity. The transmission deduction consists of either or both of 
two components:
    (1) Transmission line costs as determined pursuant to paragraph (b) 
of this section, and
    (2) Wheeling costs if the electricity is transmitted across a third-
party's transmission line under an arm's-length wheeling agreement. 
Transmission deductions are subject to the limitation prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b)(1) Transmission-line costs shall be based on the lessee's actual 
costs associated with the construction and operation of a transmission 
line for the purpose of transmitting electricity attributable and 
allocable to the lessee's powerplant utilizing Federal geothermal 
resources. The monthly transmission line cost component of the 
transmission deduction is determined by multiplying the annual 
transmission line cost rate (in dollars per kilowatthour) by the amount 
of electricity delivered for the reporting month. The transmission line 
cost rate shall be redetermined annually at the beginning of the same 
month of the year in which the transmission line was placed into 
service, the same month of the year in which the powerplant was placed 
into service, or, at the lessee's option, at a time concurrent with the 
beginning of the lessee's annual corporate accounting period; Provided, 
however, the period selected must coincide with the same period chosen 
for the generating deduction pursuant to Sec. 206.354(b)(1). After a 
deduction period is chosen, the lessee may not later elect to use a 
different deduction period without MMS approval.
    (2) Allowable transmission-line costs include operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the capital investment 
in the transmission line multiplied by a rate of return in accordance

[[Page 139]]

with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs 
are generally those costs for depreciable assets, including costs of 
delivery and installation of capital equipment, that are an integral 
part of the transmission line. A return on capital invested in the 
purchase of real estate for transmission facilities may be allowed 
provided that the lessee demonstrates the necessity for such purchase, 
the purchased land is not on a Federal geothermal lease, and MMS 
approves the deduction; the rate of return shall be the same rate 
determined in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and 
engineering, operations labor, materials, ad valorem property taxes, 
rent, supplies, and any other directly allocable and attributable 
operating expenses that the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the 
transmission line, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the transmission line is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including 
royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee 
may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital 
investment, or a return on capital investment. After a lessee has 
elected to use either method, the lessee may not later elect to change 
to the other alternative without MMS approval.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee must use a straight-line 
depreciation method based on the expected life of the geothermal 
project, usually the term of the electricity sales contract or other 
depreciation period acceptable to MMS. A change in ownership of a 
transmission line shall not alter the depreciation schedule established 
by the original lessee-owner for purposes of computing transmission line 
costs. With or without a change in ownership, a transmission line shall 
be depreciated only once. The rate of return used to compute the return 
on undepreciated capital investment shall be determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost 
shall be the amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the 
transmission line multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant 
to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided 
for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to transmission 
lines first placed into service on or after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return shall be 2 times Standard and Poor's 
industrial BBB bond rate. The rate of return shall be 2 times the 
monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for 
the first month of the annual deduction period and shall be effective 
during the following deduction period. The rate shall be redetermined 
annually at the beginning of the same month beginning the annual 
deduction period chosen pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) Transmission-line cost rates, determined annually, are computed 
by dividing the sum of the operating, maintenance, overhead, and capital 
costs by the annual amount of delivered electricity.
    (4) For new transmission lines, the lessee's costs for the first 
deduction period shall be based on estimated expenses (including 
overhead) for operating and maintaining the transmission line. For 
subsequent deduction periods, the transmission line costs shall be 
estimated based on the lessee's actual operating and maintenance 
expenses for the previous period adjusted for decreases or increases 
that the lessee knows will affect the deduction in the current period.
    (c) Under no circumstances shall the transmission deduction plus the 
generating deduction determined pursuant to Sec. 206.354 of this 
subpart reduce the royalty value of the geothermal resource to zero.
    (d)(1) If the actual transmission deduction determined at the end of 
the annual reporting period is less than the amount the lessee estimated 
and used

[[Page 140]]

in the netback procedure during the reporting period, the lessee shall 
be required to pay additional royalties retroactive to the first month 
of the reporting period, plus interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.302. If the actual transmission deduction is greater than the amount 
applied in the netback calculation, the lessee shall be entitled to a 
credit.
    (2) Lessees must submit corrected Forms MMS-2014 to reflect 
adjustments to royalty payments in accordance with MMS instructions.
    (e)(1) All transmission deductions are subject to review, audit, and 
adjustment. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its estimated or actual transmission deduction and adjust royalty 
values accordingly.
    (2) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee must 
maintain all data and records supporting its transmission deduction, 
including wheeling and other transmission-related agreements. These data 
and records must be made available to MMS and other authorized personnel 
upon request, and shall be maintained in a confidential manner in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations pursuant to Sec. 
206.352 of this subpart.
    (f) A one-time refund of royalties equal to the royalty amount of 
actual dismantlement costs attributable to the transmission line that 
are in excess of actual income attributable to the salvage of the 
transmission line will be allowed at the completion of the dismantlement 
and salvage operations.

Sec. 206.354  Determination of generating deductions.

    (a) Where the value of geothermal energy is determined by the 
geothermal netback procedure pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and 
(d)(1)(ii) of Sec. 206.352 of this subpart, that value shall be 
determined by deducting the lessee's reasonable actual costs incurred to 
generate electricity from the plant tailgate value of the electricity 
(usually the transmission-reduced value of the delivered electricity). 
Generating deductions are subject to the limitation prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b)(1) Generating costs shall be based on the lessee's actual annual 
costs associated with the construction and operation of a geothermal 
powerplant. The monthly generating deduction is determined by 
multiplying the annual generating cost rate (in dollars per 
kilowatthour) by the amount of plant tailgate electricity measured (or 
computed) for the reporting month. The generating cost rate is 
determined from the annual amount of plant tailgate electricity and must 
be redetermined annually at the beginning of the same month of the year 
in which the powerplant was placed into service or, at the lessee's 
option, at a time concurrent with the beginning of the lessee's annual 
corporate accounting period; Provided, however, the period selected must 
coincide with the same period chosen for the transmission deduction 
pursuant to Sec. 206.353(b)(1). After a deduction period is chosen, the 
lessee may not later elect to use a different deduction period without 
MMS approval.
    (2) Allowable generating costs include operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the capital investment 
in the powerplant multiplied by a rate of return in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are 
generally those costs for depreciable assets, including costs of 
delivery and installation of capital equipment, that are an integral 
part of the powerplant or are required by the design specifications of 
the power conversion cycle. A return on capital invested in the purchase 
of real estate for a powerplant site may be allowed provided that the 
lessee demonstrates the necessity for such purchase, the purchased land 
is not on a Federal geothermal lease, and MMS approves the deduction; 
the rate of return shall be the same rate determined in paragraph 
(b)(2)(v) of this section. The costs of gathering systems and other 
production-related facilities are not allowed.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and 
engineering, operations labor, materials, ad

[[Page 141]]

valorem property taxes, rent, supplies, auxiliary fuel and/or utilities 
used to operate the powerplant during down time, and any other directly 
allocable and attributable operating expense that the lessee can 
document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the 
powerplant, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and other 
directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the lessee 
can document.
    (iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation 
and maintenance of the powerplant is an allowable expense. State and 
Federal income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are not 
allowable expenses.
    (iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee 
may use either depreciation with a return on undepreciated capital 
investment, or a return on capital investment. After a lessee has 
elected to use either method, the lessee may not later elect to change 
to the other alternative without MMS approval.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee must use a straight-line 
depreciation method based on the life of the geothermal project, usually 
the term of the electricity sales contract or other depreciation period 
acceptable to MMS. A change in ownership of a powerplant shall not alter 
the depreciation schedule established by the original lessee-owner for 
computing the generating costs. With or without a change in ownership, a 
powerplant shall be depreciated only once. The rate of return used to 
compute the return on undepreciated capital investment shall be 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost 
shall be the amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the 
powerplant multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for 
depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to powerplants first 
placed into service on or after March 1, 1988.
    (v) The rate of return shall be 2 times Standard and Poor's 
industrial BBB bond rate. The rate of return shall be 2 times the 
monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for 
the first month of the annual deduction period and shall be effective 
during the following deduction period. The rate shall be redetermined 
annually at the beginning of the same month beginning the annual 
deduction period chosen pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
    (3) Generating cost rates, determined annually, shall be computed by 
dividing the sum of the operating, maintenance, overhead, and capital 
costs by the annual amount of plant tailgate electricity.
    (4) For new powerplants, the lessee's generating costs for the first 
deduction period shall be based on estimated expenses (including 
overhead) for operating and maintaining the powerplant. For subsequent 
deduction periods, the generating costs shall be estimated based on the 
lessee's actual operating and maintenance expenses for the previous 
period adjusted for decreases or increases that the lessee knows will 
affect the deduction in the current period.
    (c) Under no circumstances shall the generating deduction plus the 
transmission deduction determined pursuant to Sec. 206.353 of this 
subpart reduce the royalty value of the geothermal resource to zero.
    (d)(1) If the actual generating deduction determined at the end of 
the annual reporting period is less than the amount the lessee estimated 
and used in the netback procedure during the reporting period, the 
lessee shall be required to pay additional royalties retroactive to the 
first month of the reporting period, plus interest computed pursuant to 
30 CFR 218.302. If the actual generating deduction is greater than the 
amount applied in the netback calculation, the lessee shall be entitled 
to a credit.
    (2) Lessees must submit corrected Forms MMS-2014 to reflect 
adjustments to royalty payments in accordance with MMS instructions.
    (e)(1) All generating deductions are subject to review, audit, and 
adjustment. When necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to 
modify its

[[Page 142]]

estimated or actual generating deduction and adjust royalty values 
accordingly.
    (2) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee must 
maintain all data and records supporting its generating deduction. These 
data and records must be made available to MMS and other authorized 
personnel upon request, and shall be maintained in a confidential manner 
in accordance with applicable laws and regulations pursuant to Sec. 
206.352 of this subpart.
    (f) A one-time refund of royalties equal to the royalty amount of 
actual dismantlement costs attributable to the powerplant that are in 
excess of actual income attributable to the salvage of the powerplant 
will be allowed at the completion of the dismantlement and salvage 
operations.


<R05>
Sec. 206.355  Valuation standards for direct utilization.

    (a) The value of geothermal resources produced for leases subject to 
this subpart and used in direct utilization processes shall be 
determined pursuant to this section.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of geothermal resources that are sold pursuant 
to an arm's-length contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (ii) In conducting these reviews and audits, MMS will examine 
whether or not the contract reflects the total consideration actually 
transferred either directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller 
for the geothermal resource. If the contract does not reflect the total 
consideration, MMS may require that the geothermal resource sold 
pursuant to that contract be valued in accordance with paragraph (d) of 
this section. Value shall not be less than the gross proceeds accruing 
to the lessee, including any additional consideration received.
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the geothermal resource because of misconduct by or 
between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has 
breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual 
benefit of the lessee and the lessor, MMS shall require the geothermal 
resource to be valued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section and in 
accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this 
section. When MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS 
will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide 
written information justifying the lessee's value.
    (2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the geothermal resource.
    (c)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section 
that are sold under a non-arm's-length contract shall be determined in 
accordance with the first applicable of the following paragraphs:
    (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract provided that those gross proceeds 
are not less than the gross proceeds derived from or paid under the 
lowest-priced available comparable arm's-length contract for sales of 
geothermal resources to the lessee-affiliate's same direct utilization 
facility (the ``minimun value''). If the gross proceeds under the 
lessee's non-arm's-length contract are less than the ``minimum value'' 
under available comparable arm's-length contracts, or if there are no 
available comparable arm's-length contracts, value will be determined by 
the weighted average of the gross proceeds established under arm's-
length contracts for the sale of significant quantities of geothermal 
resources to the same direct utilization facility. Available contracts 
will mean contracts in the possession of the lessee, the lessee's 
affiliate, or MMS. In evaluating the comparability of arm's-length 
contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the following factors 
shall be considered: Time of execution, duration, terms, quality of the 
geothermal resource, volume, dedication to the same direct utilization 
facility,

[[Page 143]]

and other factors that may be appropriate to reflect the value of the 
resource;
    (ii) The equivalent value of the least expensive, reasonable 
alternative energy source (fuel). The equivalent value of the least 
expensive, reasonable alternative energy source shall be based on the 
amount of thermal energy that would otherwise be used by the direct 
utilization process in place of the geothermal resource. That amount of 
thermal energy (in Btu's) displaced by the geothermal resource shall be 
determined by the equation

thermal energy displaced =
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.017


where h<INF>in</INF> is the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the utilization 
facility inlet (based on measured inlet temperature), h<INF>out</INF> is 
the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the facility outlet (based on measured 
outlet temperature), density is in lbs/cu ft based on inlet temperature, 
the factor 0.133681 (cu ft/gal) converts gallons to cubic feet, and 
volume is the quantity of geothermal fluid in gallons produced at the 
wellhead or measured at an approved point. The efficiency of the 
alternative energy source shall be 0.7 for coal and 0.8 for oil, natural 
gas, and other fuels derived from oil and natural gas, or an efficiency 
factor proposed by the lessee and approved by MMS. The methods of 
measuring resource parameters (temperature, volume, etc.) and the 
frequency of computing and accumulating the amount of thermal energy 
displaced shall be determined and approved by BLM; or
    (iii) A value determined by any other reasonable valuation method 
approved by MMS.
    (2) Valuations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject to the 
notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d)(1) The value of geothermal resources subject to this section 
that are not subject to a sales transaction but are instead used by the 
lessee in its own direct utilization facility (``no sales'' geothermal 
resources) shall be determined in accordance with the first applicable 
of the following paragraphs:
    (i) The weighted average of the gross proceeds established in arm's-
length contracts for the purchase of significant quantities of 
geothermal resources to operate the lessee's same direct utilization 
facility. In evaluating the acceptability of arm's-length contracts, the 
following factors shall be considered: Time of execution, duration, 
terms, volume, quality of resource, and such other factors as may be 
appropriate to reflect the value of the resource;
    (ii) The equivalent value of the least expensive, reasonable 
alternative energy source (fuel). The equivalent value of the least 
expensive, reasonable alternative energy source shall be based on the 
amount of thermal energy that would otherwise be used by the direct 
utilization process in place of the geothermal resource. That amount of 
thermal energy (in Btu's) displaced by the geothermal resource shall be 
determined by the equation

thermal energy displaced =
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC15NO91.018


where h<INF>in</INF> is the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the utilization 
facility inlet (based on measured inlet temperature), h<INF>out</INF> is 
the enthalpy in Btu's/lb at the facility outlet (based on measured 
outlet temperature), density is in lbs/cu ft based on inlet temperature, 
the factor 0.133681 (cu ft/gal) converts gallons to cubic feet, and 
volume is the quantity of geothermal fluid in gallons produced at the 
wellhead or measured at an approved point. The efficiency of the 
alternative energy source shall be 0.7 for coal and 0.8 for oil, natural 
gas, and other fuels derived from oil and natural gas, or an efficiency 
factor proposed by the lessee and approved by MMS. The methods of 
measuring resource parameters (temperature, volume, etc.) and the 
frequency of computing and accumulating the amount of thermal energy 
displaced shall be determined and approved by BLM; or
    (iii) A value determined by any other reasonable valuation method 
approved by MMS.

[[Page 144]]

    (2) Valuations made pursuant to this paragraph are subject to the 
notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (e)(1) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee shall 
retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value, 
particularly where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) or 
(d) of this section. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and 
MMS will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that 
the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Upon request, lessees shall make available to authorized MMS 
representatives or to other authorized persons any and all contracts for 
the sale or other disposition of the lease production, and any arm's-
length sales and other data for like-quality production sold, purchased, 
or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the field as may be necessary 
to support a value determination.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c) or (d) of this section. The notification shall be by 
letter to the MMS Associate Director for Minerals Revenue Management or 
his/her designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be 
used and contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. 
The notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification 
due no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee 
first reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method 
authorized by paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.
    (f) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.302. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (g) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that method in determining value, for royalty purposes, until 
MMS issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data 
relevant to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the 
value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information 
MMS deems necessary. In making a value determination, MMS may use any of 
the valuation criteria consistent with this subpart. That determination 
shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues 
its determination, the lessee shall make adjustments in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of production, for royalty purposes, be 
less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee where geothermal 
energy is directly sold.
    (i) The lessee is required to place geothermal resources in 
marketable condition and to deliver geothermal resources to the direct 
utilization facility at no cost to the Federal lessor. Where the value 
established pursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross 
proceeds, that value shall be increased to the extent that the gross 
proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, 
is providing certain services the cost of which ordinarily is the 
responsibility of the lessee to place the geothermal resource in 
marketable condition or to deliver it to the direct utilization 
facility.
    (j) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to the contract. If the lessee makes timely application for a 
price increase or benefit allowed under its contract but the purchaser 
refuses and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, 
to force purchaser compliance, the lessee shall owe

[[Page 145]]

no additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration 
resulting from the price increase or additional benefits are received. 
This paragraph shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its 
royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, 
in whole or in part or timely, for a quantity of geothermal resources.
    (k) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding against the Federal Government or 
its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (l) Certain information submitted to MMS to support value 
determinations is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information 
Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be 
privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a 
confidential manner in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
All requests for information about determinations made under this 
subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of 
Information Act regulation of the Department, 43 CFR part 2.

Sec. 206.356  Valuation standards for byproducts.

    (a) The value of geothermal byproducts, including commercially 
demineralized water, shall be determined pursuant to this section, less 
applicable byproducts transportation allowances determined pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 206.357 and 206.358 of this subpart.
    (b)(1)(i) The value of byproducts that are sold pursuant to an 
arm's-length contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of 
this section. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its 
contract is arm's-length. The value that the lessee reports for royalty 
purposes is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (ii) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either 
directly or indirectly, from the buyer to the seller for the byproducts. 
If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, MMS may 
require that the byproducts sold pursuant to that contract be valued in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including any additional 
consideration received .
    (iii) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the 
reasonable value of the production because of misconduct by or between 
the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached 
its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit 
of the lessee and the lessor, MMS shall require that the byproduct 
production be valued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section and in 
accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (d) of this 
section. If MMS determines that the value may be unreasonable, MMS will 
notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written 
information justifying the lessee's reported byproduct value.
    (2) The MMS may require a lessee to certify that the provisions in 
its arm's-length contract include all of the consideration to be paid by 
the buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the byproduct.
    (c) The value of byproducts that are sold pursuant to a non-arm's-
length contract or that are utilized by the lessee (no sales), except 
demineralized water used for the benefit of the lease pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 202.351 of this subpart, shall be determined 
in accordance with the first applicable of the following paragraphs:
    (1) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non arm's-length contract (or other disposition by other than 
an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are not 
less than the gross proceeds derived from or paid under the lowest-
priced available comparable arm's-length contract for sales, purchases, 
or other dispositions of like-quality byproducts in the field or, if 
necessary to obtain a representative

[[Page 146]]

sample, from the same area (the ``minimum value''). If the gross 
proceeds under the lessee's non-arm's-length contract are less than the 
``minimum value'' under available comparable arms length contracts, or 
if there are no available comparable arm's-length contracts, value will 
be determined by the weighted average of the gross proceeds established 
under arm's-length contracts for the sale of like-quality products in 
the field or, if necessary to obtain a representative sample, from the 
same area. Available contracts will mean contracts in the possession of 
the lessee, the lessee's affiliate, or MMS. In evaluating the 
comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these 
regulations, the following factors shall be considered: Field or area, 
price, time of execution, duration, terms, quality of the byproduct, 
volume, market or markets served, and other factors that may be 
appropriate to reflect the value of the byproduct;
    (2) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published 
or publicly available spot-market prices, or information submitted by 
the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease 
operation or the saleability of certain byproducts; or
    (3) A netback method or any other reasonable method used to 
determine value.
    (d)(1) Pursuant to subpart H of 30 CFR part 212, the lessee shall 
retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value, 
particularly where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMS 
will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the 
reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) Upon request, lessees shall make available to authorized MMS 
representatives or to other authorized persons any and all contracts 
and/or invoices for the sale or other disposition of the byproducts, and 
any arm's-length sales and other data for like-quality production sold, 
purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from the field or other 
area as may be necessary to support a value determination.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section. The notification shall be by letter to 
the MMS Associate Director for Minerals Revenue Management or his/her 
designee. The letter shall identify the valuation method to be used and 
contain a brief description of the procedure to be followed. The 
notification required by this paragraph is a one-time notification due 
no later than the end of the month following the month the lessee first 
reports royalties on a Form MMS-2014 using a valuation method authorized 
by paragraph (c) of this section, and each time there is a change in a 
method under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty 
payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments 
that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The lessee shall 
also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.302. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method and 
may use that method in determining value, for royalty purposes, until 
MMS issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data 
relevant to its proposal. The MMS shall expeditiously determine the 
value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information 
MMS deems necessary. In making a value determination, MMS may use any of 
the valuation criteria consistent with this subpart. That determination 
shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After MMS issues 
its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance 
with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of the section, under no 
circumstances shall the value of byproducts for royalty purposes be less 
than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, less applicable 
byproduct transportation allowances determined pursuant to Sec. Sec. 
206.357 and 206.358 of this subpart.

[[Page 147]]

    (h) The lessee is required to place the byproducts in marketable 
condition at no cost to the Federal Government. Where the value 
established pursuant to this section is determined by a lessee's gross 
proceeds, that value shall be increased to the extent that the gross 
proceeds have been reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, 
is providing certain services the cost of which ordinarily is the 
responsibility of the lessee to place the byproducts in marketable 
condition.
    (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to the contract, and may be retroactively applied to value 
byproducts, for royalty purposes, for a period not to exceed 2 years, 
unless MMS approves a longer period. If the lessee makes timely 
application for a price increase allowed under its contract but the 
purchaser refuses and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are 
documented, to force purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no 
additional royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting 
from the price increase are received. This paragraph shall not be 
construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligation in 
situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or 
timely, for a quantity of byproducts.
    (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding against the Federal Government or 
its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.
    (k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including byproduct transportation allowances pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 206.357 and 206.358 of this subpart, is exempted from 
disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Any data 
specified by the act to be privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt 
shall be maintained in a confidential manner in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations. All requests for information about 
determinations made under this subpart are to be submitted in accordance 
with the Freedom of Information Act regulation of the Department, 43 CFR 
part 2.


<R05>
Sec. 206.357  Byproduct transportation allowances--general.

    (a) Where the value of byproducts has been determined at a point off 
the geothermal lease, unit, or participating area, MMS shall allow a 
deduction in determining value, for royalty purposes, for the lessee's 
reasonable, actual costs incurred to:
    (1) Transport the byproducts from a Federal lease, unit, or 
participating area to a sales point or point of delivery that is off the 
lease, unit, or participating area; or
    (2) Transport the byproducts from a Federal lease, unit, or 
participating area, or from a geothermal utilization facility to a 
byproduct recovery facility when that byproduct recovery facility is off 
the lease, unit, or participating area and, if applicable, from the 
recovery facility to a sales point or point of delivery off the lease, 
unit, or participating area. Costs for transporting geothermal fluids 
from the lease to the geothermal utilization facility, whether on or off 
the lease, shall not be included in the transportation allowance.
    (b) Under no circumstances shall the byproduct transportation 
allowance authorized by paragraph (a) of this section reduce the value 
of the byproducts under any selling arrangement to zero.
    (c)(1) When byproducts are transported from a lease, unit, 
participating area, or geothermal utilization facility to a byproduct 
recovery facility, the lessee is not required to allocate transportation 
costs between the quantity of marketable byproducts and the rejected 
waste material. The byproduct transportation allowance shall be 
authorized for the total production that is transported. Byproduct 
transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per unit of 
marketable byproducts transported.

[[Page 148]]

    (2) For byproducts that are extracted on the lease, unit, or 
participating area, or at the geothermal utilization facility, the 
byproduct transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total 
production that is transported to a point of sale off the lease, unit, 
or participating area. Byproduct transportation allowances shall be 
expressed as a cost per unit of byproduct transported.
    (3) Transportation costs shall be authorized as allowances only when 
the transported byproduct is sold, delivered, or otherwise utilized by 
the lessee and royalties are reported and paid.
    (d) Byproduct transportation allowances are subject to monitoring, 
review, and audit. If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that 
a lessee has improperly determined a byproduct transportation allowance 
authorized by this section, then the lessee shall pay any additional 
royalties plus interest determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.302, or 
shall be entitled to a credit without interest.
    (e) If byproducts produced from Federal and non-Federal leases are 
commingled for transportation, lessees shall not disproportionately 
allocate transportation costs to Federal lease production.
    (f) Upon request, the lessee shall make available to authorized MMS 
representatives or to other authorized persons all transportation 
contracts and all other information as may be necessary to support a 
byproduct transportation allowance.
    (g) Byproduct transportation allowances are to be reported as 
separate lines on Form MMS-2014.


<R05>
Sec. 206.358  Determination of byproduct transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For transportation costs incurred by 
a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation 
allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee 
for transporting the byproducts under that contract, subject to 
monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustments. The MMS's 
prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred 
under an arm's-length transportation contract.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration paid, MMS may require that the byproduct transportation 
allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (3) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length byproduct transportation contract does not reflect the 
reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or 
between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has 
breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual 
benefit of the lessee and the lessor, MMS shall require that the 
byproduct transportation allowance be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not established on a dollars-per-unit basis, the 
lessee shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those 
situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, 
the byproduct transportation allowance shall be based upon the lessee's 
reasonable actual costs. All byproduct transportation allowances 
deducted under a non-arm's-length or no-contract situation are subject 
to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior MMS 
approval of byproduct transportation allowances is not required for non-
arm's-length or no-contract situations.
    (2) The byproduct transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or 
no-contract situations shall be based upon

[[Page 149]]

the lessee's actual costs for transportation during the reporting 
period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and 
either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal 
to the capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the 
rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this 
section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable 
assets, including costs of delivery and installation of capital 
equipment, that are an integral part of the transportation system. A 
return on capital invested in the purchase of real estate to locate the 
byproduct transportation facilities may be allowed provided that the 
lessee demonstrates the necessity for such purchase, the purchased land 
is not on a Federal geothermal lease, and MMS approves the deduction; 
the rate of return shall be the same rate determined in paragraph 
(b)(2)(v) of this section.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include operations supervision and 
engineering, operations labor, fuel, utilities, materials, ad valorem 
property taxes, rent, supplies, and any other allocable and attributable 
operating expenses that the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include maintenance of the 
transportation system, maintenance of equipment, maintenance labor, and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including 
royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) To compute costs associated with capital investment, a lessee 
may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. 
After a lessee has elected to use either method for a transportation 
system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other 
alternative without MMS approval.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee must use a straight-line 
depreciation method based on, as appropriate, either the life of 
equipment or the life of the geothermal project that the transportation 
system services. After an election is made, the lessee may not change 
methods. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not 
alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/
lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a 
change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only 
once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage 
value. The rate of return used to compute the return on undepreciated 
capital investment shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) 
of this section.
    (B) To compute a return on capital investment, the allowed cost 
shall be the amount equal to the allowable capital investment in the 
transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be 
provided for depreciation.
    (v) The rate of return shall be Standard and Poor's industrial BBB 
bond rate. The rate of return shall be the monthly average rate as 
published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month of the 
annual reporting period for which the allowance is applicable and shall 
be effective during the reporting period. The rate shall be redetermined 
at the beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting 
period.

                          Subpart J_Indian Coal

    Source: 61 FR 5481, Feb. 12, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 206.450  Purpose and scope.

    (a) This subpart prescribes the procedures to establish the value, 
for royalty purposes, of all coal from Indian Tribal and allotted leases 
(except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma).
    (b) If the specific provisions of any statute, treaty, or settlement 
agreement between the Indian lessor and a lessee resulting from 
administrative or judicial litigation, or any coal lease

[[Page 150]]

subject to the requirements of this subpart, are inconsistent with any 
regulation in this subpart, then the statute, treaty, lease provision, 
or settlement shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
    (c) All royalty payments are subject to later audit and adjustment.
    (d) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the 
trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the 
administration of Indian coal leases are discharged in accordance with 
the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, and 
lease terms.


<R05>
Sec. 206.451  Definitions.

    Ad valorem lease means a lease where the royalty due to the lessor 
is based upon a percentage of the amount or value of the coal.
    Allowance means an approved, or an MMS-initially accepted deduction 
in determining value for royalty purposes. Coal washing allowance means 
an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for 
coal washing, or an approved or MMS-initially accepted deduction for the 
costs of washing coal, determined pursuant to this subpart. 
Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual 
costs incurred by the lessee for moving coal to a point of sale or point 
of delivery remote from both the lease and mine or wash plant, or an 
approved MMS-initially accepted deduction for costs of such 
transportation, determined pursuant to this subpart.
    Area means a geographic region in which coal has similar quality and 
economic characteristics. Area boundaries are not officially designated 
and the areas are not necessarily named.
    Arm's-length contract means a contract or agreement that has been 
arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons 
with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes 
of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is 
controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For 
purposes of this subpart, based on the instruments of ownership of the 
voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership: 
ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control; ownership of 10 
through 50 percent creates a presumption of control; and ownership of 
less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which MMS may 
rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the 
existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding any other 
provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood 
or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. MMS may require the 
lessee to certify ownership control. To be considered arm's-length for 
any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this 
definition for that production month, as well as when the contract was 
executed.
    Audit means a review, conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment 
compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay 
royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.
    BIA means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the 
Interior.
    BLM means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Coal means coal of all ranks from lignite through anthracite.
    Coal washing means any treatment to remove impurities from coal. 
Coal washing may include, but is not limited to, operations such as 
flotation, air, water, or heavy media separation; drying; and related 
handling (or combination thereof).
    Contract means any oral or written agreement, including amendments 
or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law 
that with due consideration creates an obligation.
    Gross proceeds (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies 
and other consideration accruing to a coal lessee for the production and 
disposition of the coal produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not 
limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as 
crushing, sizing, screening, storing, mixing, loading, treatment with 
substances including chemicals or oils, and other preparation of the 
coal to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no 
cost to

[[Page 151]]

the Indian lessor. Gross proceeds, as applied to coal, also includes but 
is not limited to reimbursements for royalties, taxes or fees, and other 
reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds 
accruing to a lessee even though the Indian royalty interest may be 
exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the 
forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee 
is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to 
collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
    Indian allottee means any Indian for whom land or an interest in 
land is held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to 
Federal restriction against alienation.
    Indian Tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, 
community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any 
land or interest in land is held in trust by the United States or which 
is subject to Federal restriction against alienation.
    Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, 
or other agreement issued or approved by the United States for an Indian 
coal resource under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration 
for, development or extraction of, or removal of coal--or the land 
covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context.
    Lessee means any person to whom the Indian Tribe or an Indian 
allottee issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an 
obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This 
includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an 
operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed 
the royalty payment responsibility.
    Like-quality coal means coal that has similar chemical and physical 
characteristics.
    Marketable condition means coal that is sufficiently free from 
impurities and otherwise in a condition that it will be accepted by a 
purchaser under a sales contract typical for that area.
    Mine means an underground or surface excavation or series of 
excavations and the surface or underground support facilities that 
contribute directly or indirectly to mining, production, preparation, 
and handling of lease products.
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Net-back method means a method for calculating market value of coal 
at the lease or mine. Under this method, costs of transportation, 
washing, handling, etc., are deducted from the ultimate proceeds 
received for the coal at the first point at which reasonable values for 
the coal may be determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract or by comparison to other sales of coal, to ascertain value at 
the mine.
    Net output means the quantity of washed coal that a washing plant 
produces.
    Person means by individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture.
    Selling arrangement means the individual contractual arrangements 
under which sales or dispositions of coal are made to a purchaser.
    Spot market price means the price received under any sales 
transaction when planned or actual deliveries span a short period of 
time, usually not exceeding one year.

<R05>
Sec. 206.452  Coal subject to royalties--general provisions.

    (a) All coal (except coal unavoidably lost as determined by BLM 
pursuant to 43 CFR group 3400) from an Indian lease subject to this part 
is subject to royalty. This includes coal used, sold, or otherwise 
disposed of by the lessee on or off the lease.
    (b) If a lessee receives compensation for unavoidably lost coal 
through insurance coverage or other arrangements, royalties at the rate 
specified in the lease are to be paid on the amount of compensation 
received for the coal. No royalty is due on insurance compensation 
received by the lessee for other losses.
    (c) If waste piles or slurry ponds are reworked to recover coal, the 
lessee shall pay royalty at the rate specified in the lease at the time 
the recovered coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. The 
royalty rate shall be that rate applicable to the production

[[Page 152]]

method used to initially mine coal in the waste pile or slurry pond; 
i.e., underground mining method or surface mining method. Coal in waste 
pits or slurry ponds initially mined from Indian leases shall be 
allocated to such leases regardless of whether it is stored on Indian 
lands. The lessee shall maintain accurate records to determine to which 
individual Indian lease coal in the waste pit or slurry pond should be 
allocated. However, nothing in this section requires payment of a 
royalty on coal for which a royalty has already been paid.


<R05>
Sec. 206.453  Quality and quantity measurement standards for reporting 
and paying royalties.

    For all leases subject to this subpart, the quantity of coal on 
which royalty is due shall be measured in short tons (of 2,000 pounds 
each) by methods prescribed by the BLM. Coal quantity information shall 
be reported on appropriate forms required under 30 CFR part 216 and on 
the Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report, Form MMS-4430, as 
required under 30 CFR part 210.

[61 FR 5481, Feb. 12, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 45769, Aug. 30, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 206.454  Point of royalty determination.

    (a) For all leases subject to this subpart, royalty shall be 
computed on the basis of the quantity and quality of Indian coal in 
marketable condition measured at the point of royalty measurement as 
determined jointly by BLM and MMS.
    (b) Coal produced and added to stockpiles or inventory does not 
require payment of royalty until such coal is later used, sold, or 
otherwise finally disposed of. MMS may ask BLM or BIA to increase the 
lease bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that 
stockpiles or inventory become excessive so as to increase the risk of 
degradation of the resource.
    (c) The lessee shall pay royalty at a rate specified in the lease at 
the time the coal is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of, 
unless otherwise provided for at Sec. 206.455(d) of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 206.455  Valuation standards for cents-per-ton leases.

    (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Indian Tribal and 
allotted Indian lands (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, 
Osage County, Oklahoma) which provide for the determination of royalty 
on a cents-per-ton (or other quantity) basis.
    (b) The royalty for coal from leases subject to this section shall 
be based on the dollar rate per ton prescribed in the lease. That dollar 
rate shall be applicable to the actual quantity of coal used, sold, or 
otherwise finally disposed of, including coal which is avoidably lost as 
determined by BLM pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400.
    (c) For leases subject to this section, there shall be no allowances 
for transportation, removal of impurities, coal washing, or any other 
processing or preparation of the coal.
    (d) When a coal lease is readjusted pursuant to 43 CFR part 3400 and 
the royalty valuation method changes from a cents-per-ton basis to an ad 
valorem basis, coal which is produced prior to the effective date of 
readjustment and sold or used within 30 days of the effective date of 
readjustment shall be valued pursuant to this section. All coal that is 
not used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of within 30 days after 
the effective date of readjustment shall be valued pursuant to the 
provisions of Sec. 206.456 of this subpart, and royalties shall be paid 
at the royalty rate specified in the readjusted lease.


<R05>
Sec. 206.456  Valuation standards for ad valorem leases.

    (a) This section is applicable to coal leases on Indian Tribal and 
allotted Indian lands (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, 
Osage County, Oklahoma) which provide for the determination of royalty 
as a percentage of the amount of value of coal (ad valorem). The value 
for royalty purposes of coal from such leases shall be the value of coal 
determined pursuant to this section, less applicable coal washing 
allowances and transportation allowances determined pursuant to 
Sec. Sec. 206.457 through 206.461 of this subpart, or any allowance 
authorized by Sec. 206.464 of this subpart. The royalty due shall be 
equal

[[Page 153]]

to the value for royalty purposes multiplied by the royalty rate in the 
lease.
    (b)(1) The value of coal that is sold pursuant to an arm's-length 
contract shall be the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, except as 
provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(5) of this section. The 
lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is 
arm's-length. The value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, 
is subject to monitoring, review, and audit.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either 
directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the coal 
produced. If the contract does not reflect the total consideration, then 
MMS may require that the coal sold pursuant to that contract be valued 
in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be based 
on less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the coal 
production, including the additional consideration.
    (3) If MMS determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee 
pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable value 
of the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting 
parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the 
lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and 
the lessor, then MMS shall require that the coal production be valued 
pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(iv), or (c)(2)(v) 
of this section, and in accordance with the notification requirements of 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section. When MMS determines that the value may 
be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give the lessee an 
opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's 
reported coal value.
    (4) MMS may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length 
contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the 
buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the coal production.
    (5) The value of production for royalty purposes shall not include 
payments received by the lessee pursuant to a contract which the lessee 
demonstrates, to MMS' satisfaction, were not part of the total 
consideration paid for the purchase of coal production.
    (c)(1) The value of coal from leases subject to this section and 
which is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be 
determined in accordance with this section.
    (2) If the value of the coal cannot be determined pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, then the value shall be determined 
through application of other valuation criteria. The criteria shall be 
considered in the following order, and the value shall be based upon the 
first applicable criterion:
    (i) The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale 
under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition of produced 
coal by other than an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross 
proceeds are within the range of the gross proceeds derived from, or 
paid under, comparable arm's-length contracts between buyers and sellers 
neither of whom is affiliated with the lessee for sales, purchases, or 
other dispositions of like-quality coal produced in the area. In 
evaluating the comparability of arm's-length contracts for the purposes 
of these regulations, the following factors shall be considered: price, 
time of execution, duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of 
coal, quantity, and such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect 
the value of the coal;
    (ii) Prices reported for that coal to a public utility commission;
    (iii) Prices reported for that coal to the Energy Information 
Administration of the Department of Energy;
    (iv) Other relevant matters including, but not limited to, published 
or publicly available spot market prices, or information submitted by 
the lessee concerning circumstances unique to a particular lease 
operation or the salability of certain types of coal;
    (v) If a reasonable value cannot be determined using paragraphs 
(c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii), or (c)(2)(iv) of this section, then 
a net-back method or any other reasonable method shall be used to 
determine value.
    (3) When the value of coal is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section, that value determination shall be consistent 
with the provisions

[[Page 154]]

contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (d)(1) Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of 
this section, that value does not require MMS' prior approval. However, 
the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the determination of 
royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and audit, and MMS 
will direct a lessee to use a different value if it determines that the 
reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of these 
regulations.
    (2) An Indian lessee will make available upon request to the 
authorized MMS or Indian representatives, or to the Inspector General of 
the Department of the Interior or other persons authorized to receive 
such information, arm's-length sales and sales quantity data for like-
quality coal sold, purchased, or otherwise obtained by the lessee from 
the area.
    (3) A lessee shall notify MMS if it has determined value pursuant to 
paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(iv), or (c)(2)(v) of this 
section. The notification shall be by letter to the Associate Director 
for Minerals Revenue Management or his/her designee. The letter shall 
identify the valuation method to be used and contain a brief description 
of the procedure to be followed. The notification required by this 
section is a one-time notification due no later than the month the 
lessee first reports royalties on the Form MMS-4430 using a valuation 
method authorized by paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(iv), or 
(c)(2)(v) of this section, and each time there is a change in a method 
under paragraphs (c)(2)(iv) or (c)(2)(v) of this section.
    (e) If MMS determines that a lessee has not properly determined 
value, the lessee shall be liable for the difference, if any, between 
royalty payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty 
payments that are due based upon the value established by MMS. The 
lessee shall also be liable for interest computed pursuant to 30 CFR 
218.202. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, MMS will provide 
instructions for the taking of that credit.
    (f) The lessee may request a value determination from MMS. In that 
event, the lessee shall propose to MMS a value determination method, and 
may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until MMS 
issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data relevant 
to its proposal. MMS shall expeditiously determine the value based upon 
the lessee's proposal and any additional information MMS deems 
necessary. That determination shall remain effective for the period 
stated therein. After MMS issues its determination, the lessee shall 
make the adjustments in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, under no 
circumstances shall the value for royalty purposes be less than the 
gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for the disposition of produced 
coal less applicable provisions of paragraph (b)(5) of this section and 
less applicable allowances determined pursuant to Sec. Sec. 206.457 
through 206.461 and Sec. 206.464 of this subpart.
    (h) The lessee is required to place coal in marketable condition at 
no cost to the Indian lessor. Where the value established pursuant to 
this section is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value 
shall be increased to the extent that the gross proceeds has been 
reduced because the purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain 
services, the cost of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the 
lessee to place the coal in marketable condition.
    (i) Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can 
receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. Absent 
contract revision or amendment, if the lessee fails to take proper or 
timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is entitled, it 
must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable price or benefit. 
Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing and signed by all 
parties to an arm's-length contract, and may be retroactively applied to 
value for royalty purposes for a period not to exceed two years, unless 
MMS approves a longer period. If the lessee makes timely application for 
a price increase allowed under its contract but the purchaser refuses, 
and the lessee takes reasonable measures, which are documented, to force 
purchaser compliance, the lessee will owe no additional

[[Page 155]]

royalties unless or until monies or consideration resulting from the 
price increase are received. This paragraph shall not be construed to 
permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment obligation in situations 
where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or timely, for a 
quantity of coal.
    (j) Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the 
contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process 
that results in a redetermination by MMS of value under this section 
shall be considered final or binding as against the Indian Tribes or 
allottees until the audit period is formally closed.
    (k) Certain information submitted to MMS to support valuation 
proposals, including transportation, coal washing, or other allowances 
pursuant to Sec. Sec. 206.457 through 206.461 and Sec.  206.464 of this 
subpart, is exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 
5 U.S.C. 522. Any data specified by the Act to be privileged, 
confidential, or otherwise exempt shall be maintained in a confidential 
manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations. All requests 
for information about determinations made under this part are to be 
submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act regulation 
of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR part 2. Nothing in this 
section is intended to limit or diminish in any manner whatsoever the 
right of an Indian lessor to obtain any and all information as such 
lessor may be lawfully entitled from MMS or such lessor's lessee 
directly under the terms of the lease or applicable law.

    (a) For ad valorem leases subject to Sec. 206.456 of this subpart, 
MMS shall, as authorized by this section, allow a deduction in 
determining value for royalty purposes for the reasonable, actual costs 
incurred to wash coal, unless the value determined pursuant to Sec. 
206.456 of this subpart was based upon like-quality unwashed coal. Under 
no circumstances will the authorized washing allowance and the 
transportation allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes to zero.
    (b) If MMS determines that a lessee has improperly determined a 
washing allowance authorized by this section, then the lessee shall be 
liable for any additional royalties, plus interest determined in 
accordance with 30 CFR 218.202, or shall be entitled to a credit, 
without interest.
    (c) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate washing costs to 
Indian leases.
    (d) No cost normally associated with mining operations and which are 
necessary for placing coal in marketable condition shall be allowed as a 
cost of washing.
    (e) Coal washing costs shall only be recognized as allowances when 
the washed coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.

<R05>
Sec. 206.458  Determination of washing allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For washing costs incurred by a 
lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the washing allowance shall 
be the reasonable actual costs incurred by the lessee for washing the 
coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and 
possible future adjustment. MMS' prior approval is not required before a 
lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length contract. 
However, before any deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed page one of Form MMS-4292, Coal Washing Allowance Report, in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A washing allowance 
may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 months 
prior to the first day of the month that Form MMS-4292 is filed with 
MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a showing of good cause by 
the lessee.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the washer for the 
washing. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration 
paid, then MMS may require

[[Page 156]]

that the washing allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (3) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length washing contract does not reflect the reasonable value of 
the washing because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, 
or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to 
market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the 
lessor, then MMS shall require that the washing allowance be determined 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When MMS determines 
that the value of the washing may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the 
lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information 
justifying the lessee's washing costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for washing under an arm's-length 
contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee shall 
convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent. 
Washing allowances shall be expressed as a cost per ton of coal washed.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations 
where the lessee performs washing for itself, the washing allowance will 
be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs. All washing 
allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation 
are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and possible future 
adjustment. Prior MMS approval of washing allowances is not required for 
non-arm's-length or no contract situations. However, before any 
estimated or actual deduction may be taken, the lessee must submit a 
completed Form MMS-4292 in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. A washing allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period 
of not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form 
MMS-4292 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a 
showing of good cause by the lessee. MMS will monitor the allowance 
deduction to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When 
necessary or appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its actual 
washing allowance.
    (2) The washing allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for washing 
during the reported period, including operating and maintenance 
expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable 
investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets 
(including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) 
which are an integral part of the wash plant.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the wash 
plant; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly 
allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can 
document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the wash plant is an allowable expense. State and Federal 
income taxes and severance taxes, including royalties, are not allowable 
expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either 
method for a wash plant, the lessee may not later elect to change to the 
other alternative without approval of MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the wash plant services, whichever is 
appropriate, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, 
the lessee may not change methods without MMS approval. A change in 
ownership of a wash plant shall not

[[Page 157]]

alter the depreciation schedule established by the original operator/
lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a 
change in ownership, a wash plant shall be depreciated only once. 
Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
capital investment in the wash plant multiplied by the rate of return 
determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance 
shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to 
plants first placed in service or acquired after March 1, 1989.
    (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly 
average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the 
first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is 
applicable and shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate 
shall be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent washing 
allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section).
    (3) The washing allowance for coal shall be determined based on the 
lessee's reasonable and actual cost of washing the coal. The lessee may 
not take an allowance for the costs of washing lease production that is 
not royalty bearing.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the 
exception of those washing allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(v) 
and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page one of the 
initial Form MMS-4292 prior to, or at the same time, as the washing 
allowance determined pursuant to an arm's-length contract is reported on 
Form MMS-4430, Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report. A Form MMS-
4292 received by the end of the month that the Form MMS-4430 is due 
shall be considered to be received timely.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4292 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct 
a washing allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar 
year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is modified 
or amended, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding 
reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form MMS-4292 within 
3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after the applicable 
contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is 
earlier, unless MMS approves a longer period (during which period the 
lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting 
period).
    (iv) MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length washing 
contracts and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a 
reasonable time, as determined by MMS.
    (v) Washing allowances which are based on arm's-length contracts and 
which are in effect at the time these regulations become effective will 
be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. For the purposes 
of this section, only those allowances that have been approved by MMS in 
writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time these regulations 
become effective.
    (vi) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those 
washing allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and (c)(2)(vii) of 
this section, the lessee shall submit an initial Form MMS-4292 prior to, 
or at the same time as, the washing allowance determined pursuant to a 
non-arm's-length contract or no contract situation is reported on Form 
MMS-4430, Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report. A Form MMS-4292 
received by the end of the month that the Form MMS-4430 is due shall be 
considered to be timely received. The initial reporting may be based on 
estimated costs.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4292 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct 
a washing allowance and shall continue until the end of the calendar 
year, or until the washing under the non-arm's-length contract or the no 
contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.

[[Page 158]]

    (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial 
reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4292 
containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If coal 
washing is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4292 its 
estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated coal washing 
allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the previous period 
plus or minus any adjustments which are based on the lessee's knowledge 
of decreases or increases which will affect the allowance. Form MMS-4292 
must be received by MMS within 3 months after the end of the previous 
reporting period, unless MMS approves a longer period (during which 
period the lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous 
reporting period).
    (iv) For new wash plants, the lessee's initial Form MMS-4292 shall 
include estimates of the allowable coal washing costs for the applicable 
period. Cost estimates shall be based upon the most recently available 
operations data for the plant, or if such data are not available, the 
lessee shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar coal 
wash plants.
    (v) Washing allowances based on non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used by 
the lessee to prepare its Forms MMS-4292. The data shall be provided 
within a reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (vii) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements which are different from the requirements of this section.
    (3) MMS may establish coal washing allowance reporting dates for 
individual leases different from those specified in this subpart in 
order to provide more effective administration. Lessees will be notified 
of any change in their reporting period.
    (4) Washing allowances must be reported as a separate line on the 
Form MMS-4430, unless MMS approves a different reporting procedure.
    (d) Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and failure 
to report. (1) If a lessee deducts a washing allowance on its Form MMS-
4430 without complying with the requirements of this section, the lessee 
shall be liable for interest on the amount of such deduction until the 
requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee also shall 
repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this section.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a washing allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202.
    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual coal washing allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-4430 for each month 
during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required 
to pay additional royalties due plus interest computed pursuant to 30 
CFR 218.202, retroactive to the first month the lessee is authorized to 
deduct a washing allowance. If the actual washing allowance is greater 
than the amount the lessee has estimated and taken during the reporting 
period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit, without interest.
    (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-4430 to reflect 
actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Other washing cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine washing costs when establishing value 
using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of washing costs.

Sec. 206.459  Allocation of washed coal.

    (a) When coal is subjected to washing, the washed coal must be 
allocated to the leases from which it was extracted.

[[Page 159]]

    (b) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from 
coal obtained from only one lease, the quantity of washed coal allocable 
to the lease will be based on the net output of the washing plant.
    (c) When the net output of coal from a washing plant is derived from 
coal obtained from more than one lease, unless determined otherwise by 
BLM, the quantity of net output of washed coal allocable to each lease 
will be based on the ratio of measured quantities of coal delivered to 
the washing plant and washed from each lease compared to the total 
measured quantities of coal delivered to the washing plant and washed.


<R05>
Sec. 206.460  Transportation allowances--general.

    (a) For ad valorem leases subject to Sec. 206.456 of this subpart, 
where the value for royalty purposes has been determined at a point 
remote from the lease or mine, MMS shall, as authorized by this section, 
allow a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes for the 
reasonable, actual costs incurred to:
    (1) Transport the coal from an Indian lease to a sales point which 
is remote from both the lease and mine; or
    (2) Transport the coal from an Indian lease to a wash plant when 
that plant is remote from both the lease and mine and, if applicable, 
from the wash plant to a remote sales point. In-mine transportation 
costs shall not be included in the transportation allowance.
    (b) Under no circumstances will the authorized washing allowance and 
the transportation allowance reduce the value for royalty purposes to 
zero.
    (c)(1) When coal transported from a mine to a wash plant is eligible 
for a transportation allowance in accordance with this section, the 
lessee is not required to allocate transportation costs between the 
quantity of clean coal output and the rejected waste material. The 
transportation allowance shall be authorized for the total production 
which is transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a 
cost per ton of cleaned coal transported.
    (2) For coal that is not washed at a wash plant, the transportation 
allowance shall be authorized for the total production which is 
transported. Transportation allowances shall be expressed as a cost per 
ton of coal transported.
    (3) Transportation costs shall only be recognized as allowances when 
the transported coal is sold and royalties are reported and paid.
    (d) If, after a review and/or audit, MMS determines that a lessee 
has improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this 
section, then the lessee shall pay any additional royalties, plus 
interest, determined in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202, or shall be 
entitled to a credit, without interest.
    (e) Lessees shall not disproportionately allocate transportation 
costs to Indian leases.

<R05>
Sec. 206.461  Determination of transportation allowances.

    (a) Arm's-length contracts. (1) For transportation costs incurred by 
a lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the transportation 
allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee 
for transporting the coal under that contract, subject to monitoring, 
review, audit, and possible future adjustment. MMS' prior approval is 
not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-
length contract. However, before any deduction may be taken, the lessee 
must submit a completed page one of Form MMS-4293, Coal Transportation 
Allowance Report, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A 
transportation allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of 
not more than 3 months prior to the first day of the month that Form 
MMS-4293 is filed with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a 
showing of good cause by the lessee.
    (2) In conducting reviews and audits, MMS will examine whether the 
contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred 
either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the 
transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total 
consideration paid, then MMS

[[Page 160]]

may require that the transportation allowance be determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) If MMS determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an 
arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable 
value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the 
contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its 
duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of 
the lessee and the lessor, then MMS shall require that the 
transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) 
of this section. When MMS determines that the value of the 
transportation may be unreasonable, MMS will notify the lessee and give 
the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the 
lessee's transportation costs.
    (4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-
length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, the lessee 
shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value 
equivalent for the purposes of this section.
    (b) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (1) If a lessee has a non-
arm's-length contract or has no contract, including those situations 
where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the 
transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable 
actual costs. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-
length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, 
audit, and possible future adjustment. Prior MMS approval of 
transportation allowances is not required for non-arm's-length or no 
contract situations. However, before any estimated or actual deduction 
may be taken, the lessee must submit a completed Form MMS-4293 in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A transportation 
allowance may be claimed retroactively for a period of not more than 3 
months prior to the first day of the month that Form MMS-4293 is filed 
with MMS, unless MMS approves a longer period upon a showing of good 
cause by the lessee. MMS will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure 
that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or 
appropriate, MMS may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual 
transportation allowance deduction.
    (2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no contract 
situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation during the reporting period, including operating and 
maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on 
undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the depreciable 
investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable 
capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets 
(including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) 
which are an integral part of the transportation system.
    (i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and 
engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem 
property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and 
attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.
    (ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the 
transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and 
other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the 
lessee can document.
    (iii) Overhead attributable and allocable to the operation and 
maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State 
and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including 
royalties, are not allowable expenses.
    (iv) A lessee may use either paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) or paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. After a lessee has elected to use either 
method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to 
change to the other alternative without approval of MMS.
    (A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a 
straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on 
the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, 
whichever is appropriate,

[[Page 161]]

or a unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee 
may not change methods without MMS approval. A change in ownership of a 
transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule 
established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the 
allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a 
transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall 
not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.
    (B) MMS shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable 
capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate 
of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(B)(v) of this section. 
No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall 
apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service or 
acquired after March 1, 1989.
    (v) The rate of return shall be the industrial rate associated with 
Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return shall be the monthly 
average as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first 
month of the reporting period of which the allowance is applicable and 
shall be effective during the reporting period. The rate shall be 
redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent transportation 
allowance reporting period (which is determined pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section).
    (3) A lessee may apply to MMS for exception from the requirement 
that it compute actual costs in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and 
(b)(2) of this section. MMS will grant the exception only if the lessee 
has a rate for the transportation approved by a Federal agency for 
Indian leases. MMS shall deny the exception request if it determines 
that the rate is excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation 
charges by systems, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar 
transportation services in that area. If there are no arm's-length 
transportation charges, MMS shall deny the exception request if:
    (i) No Federal regulatory agency cost analysis exists and the 
Federal regulatory agency has declined to investigate pursuant to MMS 
timely objections upon filing; and
    (ii) The rate significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for 
transportation as determined under this section.
    (c) Reporting requirements--(1) Arm's-length contracts. (i) With the 
exception of those transportation allowances specified in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(v) and (c)(1)(vi) of this section, the lessee shall submit page 
one of the initial Form MMS-4293 prior to, or at the same time as, the 
transportation allowance determined pursuant to an arm's-length contract 
is reported on Form MMS-4430, Solid Minerals Production and Royalty 
Report.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4293 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee is first authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until the applicable contract or rate terminates or is 
modified or amended, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) After the initial reporting period and for succeeding 
reporting periods, lessees must submit page one of Form MMS-4293 within 
3 months after the end of the calendar year, or after the applicable 
contract or rate terminates or is modified or amended, whichever is 
earlier, unless MMS approves a longer period (during which period the 
lessee shall continue to use the allowance from the previous reporting 
period). Lessees may request special reporting procedures in unique 
allowance reporting situations, such as those related to spot sales.
    (iv) MMS may require that a lessee submit arm's-length 
transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, 
and related documents. Documents shall be submitted within a reasonable 
time, as determined by MMS.
    (v) Transportation allowances that are based on arm's-length 
contracts and which are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For the purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.

[[Page 162]]

    (vi) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
    (2) Non-arm's-length or no contract. (i) With the exception of those 
transportation allowances specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(v) and 
(c)(2)(vii) of this section, the lessee shall submit an initial Form 
MMS-4293 prior to, or at the same time as, the transportation allowance 
determined pursuant to a non-arm's-length contract or no contract 
situation is reported on Form MMS-4430, Solid Minerals Production and 
Royalty Report. The initial report may be based on estimated costs.
    (ii) The initial Form MMS-4293 shall be effective for a reporting 
period beginning the month that the lessee first is authorized to deduct 
a transportation allowance and shall continue until the end of the 
calendar year, or until the transportation under the non-arm's-length 
contract or the no contract situation terminates, whichever is earlier.
    (iii) For calendar-year reporting periods succeeding the initial 
reporting period, the lessee shall submit a completed Form MMS-4293 
containing the actual costs for the previous reporting period. If the 
transportation is continuing, the lessee shall include on Form MMS-4293 
its estimated costs for the next calendar year. The estimated 
transportation allowance shall be based on the actual costs for the 
previous reporting period plus or minus any adjustments that are based 
on the lessee's knowledge of decreases or increases that will affect the 
allowance. Form MMS-4293 must be received by MMS within 3 months after 
the end of the previous reporting period, unless MMS approves a longer 
period (during which period the lessee shall continue to use the 
allowance from the previous reporting period).
    (iv) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, the lessee's 
initial Form MMS-4293 shall include estimates of the allowable 
transportation costs for the applicable period. Cost estimates shall be 
based upon the most recently available operations data for the 
transportation system, or, if such data are not available, the lessee 
shall use estimates based upon industry data for similar transportation 
systems.
    (v) Non-arm's-length contract or no contract-based transportation 
allowances that are in effect at the time these regulations become 
effective will be allowed to continue until such allowances terminate. 
For purposes of this section, only those allowances that have been 
approved by MMS in writing shall qualify as being in effect at the time 
these regulations become effective.
    (vi) Upon request by MMS, the lessee shall submit all data used to 
prepare its Form MMS-4293. The data shall be provided within a 
reasonable period of time, as determined by MMS.
    (vii) MMS may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting 
requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
    (viii) If the lessee is authorized to use its Federal-agency-
approved rate as its transportation cost in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section, it shall follow the reporting requirements of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) MMS may establish reporting dates for individual lessees 
different than those specified in this paragraph in order to provide 
more effective administration. Lessees will be notified as to any change 
in their reporting period.
    (4) Transportation allowances must be reported as a separate line 
item on Form MMS-4430, unless MMS approves a different reporting 
procedure.
    (d) Interest assessments for incorrect or late reports and failure 
to report. (1) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its 
Form MMS-4430 without complying with the requirements of this section, 
the lessee shall be liable for interest on the amount of such deduction 
until the requirements of this section are complied with. The lessee 
also shall repay the amount of any allowance which is disallowed by this 
section.
    (2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which 
results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the 
amount of that underpayment.
    (3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined 
in accordance with 30 CFR 218.202.

[[Page 163]]

    (e) Adjustments. (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less 
than the amount the lessee has taken on Form MMS-4430 for each month 
during the allowance form reporting period, the lessee shall be required 
to pay additional royalties due plus interest, computed pursuant to 30 
CFR 218.202, retroactive to the first month the lessee is authorized to 
deduct a transportation allowance. If the actual transportation 
allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has estimated and taken 
during the reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit, 
without interest.
    (2) The lessee must submit a corrected Form MMS-4430 to reflect 
actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions 
provided by MMS.
    (f) Other transportation cost determinations. The provisions of this 
section shall apply to determine transportation costs when establishing 
value using a net-back valuation procedure or any other procedure that 
requires deduction of transportation costs.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 208.1  General.

    The regulations in this part govern the sale of royalty oil by the 
United States to eligible refiners. The regulations apply to royalty oil 
from leases on Federal lands onshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf 
(OCS).


<R05>
Sec. 208.2  Definitions.

    Allotment means the quantity of royalty oil that DOI determines is 
available to each eligible refiner that has applied for a portion of the 
total volume of royalty oil offered in a given royalty oil sale.
    Application means the formal written request to DOI on Form MMS-4070 
by an eligible refiner interested in purchasing a quantity of royalty 
oil from the approximate volume announced by DOI in a given ``Notice of 
Availability of Royalty Oil.''
    Area or Region means the geographic territory having Federal oil and 
gas leases over which MMS has jurisdiction, unless the context in which 
those words are used indicates that a different meaning is intended.
    Contracting officer means the Director, his or her delegate, or the 
person designated under a royalty oil purchase contract.
    Contracting officer's decision means an MMS order or decision that a 
contracting officer issues under this part to a purchaser of oil under a 
royalty oil purchase contract.
    Delivery point means the point where the lessor, in accordance with 
lease terms, directs the lessee to deliver royalty oil to a purchaser. 
Title to the royalty oil, or to the quantity thereof in a commingled 
stream, passes from the Federal Government to the purchaser at this 
designated point, which is specified in the royalty oil contract. For 
onshore leases, the delivery point

[[Page 166]]

will be on or adjacent to the lease, except as provided in Sec. 
208.8(a) of this part. In instances where an onshore delivery point is 
designated for offshore royalty oil, such point generally will be the 
first onshore point where the price of the oil, including transportation 
costs, can be determined and where the purchaser can either exchange or 
take delivery of the oil. The Government does not guarantee physical 
access to the oil at such point.
    Director means the Director of MMS, who is responsible for its 
overall direction, or his or her delegate(s).
    DOI means the Department of the Interior, including the Secretary or 
his or her delegate(s).
    Eligible refiner means a refiner of crude oil that meets the 
following criteria for eligibility to purchase royalty oil:
    (1) For the purchase of royalty oil from onshore leases, it means a 
refiner that qualifies as a small and independent refiner as those terms 
are defined in sections 3(3) and 3(4) of the Emergency Petroleum 
Allocation Act, 15 U.S.C. 751 et seq., except that the time period for 
determination contained in section 3(3)(A) would be the calendar quarter 
immediately preceding the date of the applicable ``Notice of 
Availability of Royalty Oil.'' A refiner that, together with all persons 
controlled by, in control of, under common control with, or otherwise 
affiliated with the refiner, inputs a volume of domestic crude oil from 
its own production exceeding 30 percent of its total refinery input of 
crude oil is ineligible to participate in royalty oil sales under this 
part. Crude oil received in exchange for such refiner's own production 
is considered to be that refiner's own production for purposes of this 
section.
    (2) For the purchase of royalty oil from leases on the OCS, it means 
a refiner that qualifies as a small business enterprise under the rules 
of the Small Business Administration (13 CFR part 121).
    Entitlement means the volume of royalty oil from the Federal 
Government's share of production from a Federal lease which a purchaser 
is entitled to receive under a royalty oil contract.
    Exchange agreement means a written agreement between the purchaser 
and another person for the exchange of royalty oil purchased under this 
part for other oil on a volume or equivalent value basis.
    Fair market value means the value of oil--(1) Computed at a unit 
price equivalent to the average unit price at which oil was sold 
pursuant to a lease during the period for which any royalty or net 
profit share is accrued or reserved to the United States pursuant to 
such lease, or
    (2) If there were no such sales, or if the Secretary finds that 
there were an insufficient number of such sales to equitably determine 
such value, computed at the average unit price at which oil was sold 
pursuant to other leases in the same region of the OCS during such 
period, or
    (3) If there were no sales of oil from such region during such 
period, or if the Secretary finds that there are an insufficient number 
of such sales to equitably determine such value, at an appropriate price 
determined by the Secretary.
    Federal lease means a contractual agreement with the Federal 
Government which authorizes the exploration, development, and production 
of oil and gas on Federal lands onshore or on the OCS.
    Interim sale means a sale conducted as a result of substantial 
additional royalty oil becoming available in a specific area prior to 
the scheduled expiration date of royalty oil contracts in effect for 
that area.
    Lessee means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, or 
any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or other 
payments required by the lease.
    MMS means the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the 
Interior.
    Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil means a notice published by 
DOI in the Federal Register (and in other printed media when 
appropriate, such as a newspaper or magazine of general or specialized 
circulation) to advise interested parties of the availability of royalty 
oil for purchase by eligible refiners and the approximate volume of 
royalty oil available to the applicants.

[[Page 167]]

    OCS means the Outer Continental Shelf, as defined in 43 U.S.C. 
1331(a).
    OCSLA means the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et 
seq., as amended by 43 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.).
    Oil means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase 
in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric 
pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and is 
marketed or used as such. Condensate recovered in lease separators or 
field facilities is considered to be oil.
    Operator means any person, including a lessee, who has control of or 
who manages operations on an oil and gas lease site on Federal onshore 
lands or on the OCS.
    Payor means any person responsible for reporting royalties from a 
Federal lease or leases on Form MMS-2014.
    Person means any individual, firm, corporation, association, 
partnership, consortium, or joint venture.
    Preference eligible refiner means an eligible refiner with at least 
one operating refinery which is located within the area designated as 
the preference eligible area in the ``Notice of Availability of Royalty 
Oil.'' A refiner may be deemed to be a preference eligible refiner if it 
owns a refinery located in the preference eligible area which is not 
operational if the refiner meets the requirements of Sec. 208.7(g) of 
this part.
    Purchaser means anyone who acquires royalty oil sold by DOI under 
the Federal Government's Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program and who has a 
contractual obligation under an agreement to purchase royalty oil.
    Reallocation means an offering of royalty oil previously allocated 
in a specific sale but subsequently turned back to MMS. A reallocation 
would only be made if substantial amounts of royalty oil are turned 
back.
    Refined petroleum product means gasoline, kerosene, distillates 
(including Number 2 fuel oil), refined lubricating oils, or diesel fuel.
    Royalty oil means that amount of oil that DOI takes in kind in 
partial or full satisfaction of a lessee's royalty or net profit share 
obligations as determined by whatever lease interest the lessee holds 
under an applicable mineral leasing law.
    Secretary means the Secretary of the Department of the Interior or 
his/her delegate(s).
    Section 6 lease means an oil and gas lease originally issued by any 
State and currently maintained in effect pursuant to section 6 of the 
OCSLA.
    Section 8 lease means an oil and gas lease originally issued by the 
United States pursuant to section 8 of the OCSLA.

Sec. 208.3  Information collection.

    The information collection requirements contained in this part have 
been approved by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The form, filing date, 
and approved OMB clearance number are identified in 30 CFR 210.10.

<R05>
Sec. 208.4  Royalty oil sales to eligible refiners.

    (a) Determination to take royalty oil in kind. The Secretary may 
evaluate crude oil market conditions from time to time. The evaluation 
will include, among other things, the availability of crude oil and the 
crude oil requirements of the Federal Government, primarily those 
requirements concerning matters of national interest and defense. The 
Secretary will review these items and will determine whether eligible 
refiners have access to adequate supplies of crude oil and whether such 
oil is available to eligible refiners at equitable prices. Such 
determinations may be made on a regional basis. The determination by the 
Secretary shall be published in the Federal Register concurrent with or 
included in the ``Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil'' required by 30 
CFR 208.5.
    (b) Sale to eligible refiners. (1) Upon a determination by the 
Secretary under paragraph (a) of this section that eligible refiners do 
not have access to adequate supplies of crude oil at equitable prices, 
the Secretary, at his or her discretion, may elect to take in kind some 
or all of the royalty oil accruing to the United States from oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands onshore and on the OCS. The Secretary may 
authorize

[[Page 168]]

MMS to offer royalty oil for sale to eligible refiners only for use in 
their refineries and not for resale (other than under an exchange 
agreement).
    (2) All sales of royalty oil from onshore leases will be priced at 
the royalty value that would have been determined for that oil pursuant 
to 30 CFR part 206 had the royalties been paid in value rather than 
taken in kind. All sales of royalty oil from OCS leases will be priced 
at the fair market value of the oil including associated transportation 
costs to the designated delivery point, if applicable.
    (3) An eligible refiner must have a representative at a sale in 
order to participate. The Secretary may, at his or her discretion, 
establish purchase limitations and withhold any royalty oil from any 
offering.
    (c) Upon a determination by the Secretary under paragraph (a) of 
this section that eligible refiners do have access to adequate supplies 
of crude oil at equitable prices, MMS will not take royalties in kind 
from oil and gas leases for exclusive sale to such refiners. Such 
determinations may be made on a regional basis.
    (d) Interim sales. The MMS generally will not conduct interim sales. 
However, interim sales may be held at the discretion of the Secretary if 
substantial addition royalty oil becomes available. The potentially 
eligible refiners, individually or collectively, must submit 
documentation demonstrating that adequate supplies of crude oil at 
equitable prices are not available for purchase. Although sufficient 
documentation must be submitted, it is not mandatory for each 
potentially eligible refiner to participate in a submission of such 
documentation to be determined eligible. The documentation must be 
submitted to MMS for a determination as to whether an interim sale is 
needed.

[52 FR 41913, Oct. 30, 1987, as amended at 66 FR 28657, May 24, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 208.5  Notice of royalty oil sale.

    If the Secretary decides to take royalty oil in kind for sale to 
eligible refiners, MMS will issue a ``Notice of Availability of Royalty 
Oil'' specifying the manner in which the sale is to be effected, the 
approximate quantity of royalty oil to be offered, information required 
in applications, the closing date for the receipt of applications for 
royalty oil, and other general administrative details concerning the 
application, allocation, and contract award process for the royalty oil. 
The Notice will describe generally the terms under which the royalty oil 
contracts will be awarded and will specify which applicants will be 
deemed preference eligible refiners in the sale proceedings. The Notice 
will also contain guidelines for reallocation procedures in the event 
substantial quantities of royalty oil sold in that specific sale are 
subsequently turned back to MMS. Only those purchasers that hold ongoing 
contracts from that specific sale will be allowed to participate in any 
reallocation, which would be voluntary, and then only if they continue 
to meet eligibility requirements as set forth in 30 CFR 208.2 and 208.7. 
If a reallocation is held prior to the effective date of the contracts 
as specified in the ``Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil'', all 
eligible refiners that selected a lease or leases in that specific sale 
would be allowed to participate, pursuant to the procedures in the 
Notice.


<R05>
Sec. 208.6  General application procedures.

    (a) To apply for the purchase of royalty oil, an applicant must file 
a Form MMS-4070 with MMS in accordance with instructions provided in the 
``Notice of Availability of Royalty Oil'' and in accordance with any 
instructions issued by MMS for completion of Form MMS-4070. The 
applicant will be required to submit a letter of intent from a qualified 
financial institution stating that it would be granted surety coverage 
for the royalty oil for which it is applying, or other such proof of 
surety coverage, as deemed acceptable by MMS. The letter of intent must 
be submitted with a completed Form MMS-4070.
    (b) In addition to any other application requirements specified in 
the Notice, the following information is required on Form MMS-4070 at 
the time of application:
    (1) Name and address of the applicant, the location of the 
applicant's refinery or refineries, and disclosure of

[[Page 169]]

the applicant's affiliation with any other persons.
    (2) The capacity of the applicant's refineries in barrels of crude 
oil throughput per calendar day and a tabulation for the past 12 months 
of oil processed for each refinery, identified as to source (from own 
production or from other sources).
    (3) Identification of any Government royalty oil contracts under 
which the applicant is currently receiving royalty oil.
    (4) Identification of the locations (area/region and State) where 
the applicant proposes to purchase royalty oil, the volume of oil 
requested, and the specific refineries in which the oil will be refined.
    (5) A certification from the applicant that it is an eligible 
refiner for the purchase of Government royalty oil, as defined in Sec. 
208.2 of this part.

[52 FR 41913, Oct. 30, 1987, as amended at 58 FR 64901, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 208.7  Determination of eligibility.

    (a) The MMS will examine each application and may request additional 
information if the information in the application is inadequate. An 
application received after the close of the application period will be 
rejected. If additional information is requested by MMS, it must be 
received by the time specified or the application will be rejected.
    (b) After the close of the application period and the receipt of any 
additional requested information, MMS will determine which applicants 
may participate in the royalty oil sale and the quantity of royalty oil 
which each applicant is authorized to purchase.
    (c) When applications are filed by two or more eligible refiners for 
the same royalty oil, the oil will be allocated among such applicants on 
an equitable basis as determined by MMS. Preference eligible refiners 
will be given priority in the allocation procedures in sales and 
subsequent reallocations of royalty oil.
    (d) No eligible refiner shall be awarded contracts for volumes of 
royalty oil that, when added to volumes of other Federal royalty oil 
being received, are in excess of 60 percent of the combined refinery 
capacity of that refiner.
    (e) The MMS may exclude any section 6 lease from a royalty oil sale.
    (f) If two or more eligible refiners are related through common 
ownership or control or otherwise affiliated, only one of them shall be 
entitled to an allotment of royalty oil from a specific sale.
    (g) Any applicant whose refinery is not in operation during the 60-
day period prior to the date of the royalty oil sale shall not be 
entitled to participate in the sale unless such applicant self-certifies 
and demonstrates to the satisfaction of MMS that it will begin 
operations by the first month in which oil becomes available under a 
royalty oil contract. If operations do not begin by that month, MMS will 
terminate the contract.
    (h) Applicants or purchasers that have delinquent balances with MMS 
as of the date of a royalty oil sale or subsequent reallocation will not 
be allowed to participate in that sale or reallocation. If a person 
which is controlled by, in control of, under common control with, or 
otherwise affiliated with an applicant or purchaser has such delinquent 
balances, the applicant or purchaser will not be allowed to participate 
in a royalty oil sale or reallocation. To the extent a purchaser or 
affiliated person has appealed a billing and posted a surety instrument 
in accordance with the contract terms and applicable MMS regulations or 
other law, the balance shall not be considered delinquent.
    (i) A purchaser must meet the eligibility criteria on the date of 
contract issuance. However, a change in a purchaser's eligibility status 
during the term of the contract will not affect the purchaser's right to 
continue that contract until its term expires, including any extensions 
thereof.

Sec. 208.8  Transportation and delivery.

    (a) The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from onshore leases to the 
purchaser at a point on or adjacent to the lease pursuant to the terms 
of the lease. If the purchaser does not have access to its onshore 
royalty oil entitlement at facilities on or adjacent to the lease, the 
operator of the lease

must designate an alternate delivery point at no additional cost to the 
purchaser or the Government. The purchaser must have physical access to 
the oil at the alternate delivery point and such point must be approved 
by MMS.
    (b) The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from section 8 offshore 
leases issued after September 1969 at a delivery point to be designated 
by MMS. The lessee shall deliver royalty oil from section 8 offshore 
leases issued before October 1969 or from section 6 leases at a delivery 
point to be designated by the lessee. If the delivery point is on or 
immediately adjacent to the lease, the royalty oil will be delivered 
without cost to the Federal Government as an undivided portion of 
production in marketable condition at pipeline connections or other 
facilities provided by the lessee, unless other arrangements are 
approved by MMS. If the delivery point is not on or immediately adjacent 
to the lease, MMS will reimburse the lessee for the reasonable cost of 
transportation to such point in an amount not to exceed the 
transportation allowance determined pursuant to 30 CFR part 206. The MMS 
will include such transportation costs in the price charged for the oil 
taken in kind to reflect the value of the oil at the delivery point. 
Arrangements for delivery of the royalty oil from, or exchange of the 
oil at, the delivery point, and related transportation costs, are the 
responsibility of the purchaser of the royalty oil. In addition, quality 
differentials between the royalty oil to which a purchaser is entitled 
and the oil which is made available at the delivery point are matters to 
be resolved between the purchaser and the operator.
    (c) When the purchaser has physical access to the royalty oil at the 
delivery point, the lessee shall deliver such oil in marketable 
condition at pipeline connections or other facilities designated by MMS. 
If the lessee is unable to provide the royalty portion of actual 
production from the lease, the lessee must provide crude oil to the 
purchaser which is equivalent in volume or value to the royalty oil to 
which the purchaser is entitled. The lessee will deliver the royalty oil 
to the purchaser during normal operating hours and in reasonable 
quantities and intervals. The lessee will make available and the 
purchaser will accept delivery of the royalty oil entitlement no later 
than the last day of the calendar month immediately following the 
calendar month in which the oil was produced. Failure to accept 
deliveries shall constitute grounds for the termination of the contract.
    (d) Upon termination of deliveries under a royalty oil contract, the 
transportation allowance and delivery point designation authorized by 
this section no longer will remain in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 208.9  Agreements.

    (a) A purchaser must submit to MMS two copies of any written third-
party agreements, or two copies of a full written explanation of any 
oral third-party agreements, relating to the method and costs of 
delivery of royalty oil, or crude oil exchanged for the royalty oil, 
from the point of delivery under the contract to the purchaser's 
refinery. In addition, the purchaser must submit copies of agreements 
pertaining to quality differentials which may occur between leases and 
delivery points.
    (b) A purchaser may not sell royalty oil which it purchases pursuant 
to this part except for purposes of an exchange for other crude oil on a 
volume or equivalent value basis.
    (c) Royalty oil purchased under this part, or crude oil received in 
exchange for such royalty oil, must be processed into refined petroleum 
products in the purchaser's refinery.


<R05>
Sec. 208.10  Notices.

    (a) The MMS shall notify each operator, by certified mail, of the 
Secretary's decision to take royalty oil in kind. This notice shall be 
mailed at least 45 days in advance of the effective date of delivery and 
will specify delivery points for offshore oil for OCS leases issued 
after September 1969.
    (b) Deliveries of royalty oil may be partially terminated only with 
the written approval of the Director, MMS.

[[Page 171]]

    (c) Before terminating the delivery of royalty oil taken in kind, 
MMS, if possible, will notify each operator by certified mail of the 
change in requirements at least 30 days in advance of the effective 
date.
    (d) After MMS notification that royalty oil will be taken in kind, 
the operator shall be responsible for notifying each working interest on 
the Federal lease. As soon as practicable after the date of each royalty 
oil sale, MMS will publish in the Federal Register a notice of the 
leases from which royalty oil will be taken, the purchasers of the 
royalty oil, and the leases from which royalty oil deliveries will be 
discontinued on terminated contracts.
    (e) A purchaser cannot transfer, assign, or sell its rights or 
interest in a royalty oil contract without written approval of the 
Director, MMS. If the purchaser changes ownership or its assets are sold 
or liquidated for any reason, it cannot transfer, assign, or sell its 
rights or interest in the royalty oil contract without written approval 
of the Director, MMS. Without express written consent from MMS for a 
change in ownership, the royalty oil contract shall be terminated. The 
successor company must meet the definition of an eligible refiner in 
Sec. 208.2 of this part for MMS to consider assignment of the royalty 
oil contract.


<R05>
Sec. 208.11  Surety requirements.

    (a) The eligible purchaser, prior to execution of the contract, 
shall furnish an ``MMS-specified surety instrument,'' in an amount equal 
to the estimated value of royalty oil that could be taken by the 
purchaser in a 99-day period, plus related administrative charges. The 
MMS may require the purchaser to increase the amount of the surety 
instrument when necessary to protect the Government's interest or may 
allow the purchaser to decrease the amount of the surety instrument 
where necessary to further the purposes of the Royalty-in-Kind Program.
    (b) If a letter of credit is furnished as the surety instrument, it 
must be effective for a 9-month period beginning the first day the 
royalty oil contract is effective, with a clause providing for automatic 
renewal monthly for a new 9-month period. The purchaser or its surety 
company may elect not to renew the letter of credit at any monthly 
anniversary date, but must notify MMS of its intent not to renew at 
least 30 days prior to the anniversary date. The MMS may grant the 
purchaser 45 days to obtain a new surety instrument. If no replacement 
surety instrument is provided, MMS will terminate the contract effective 
at least 6 months prior to the expiration date of the letter of credit. 
Notwithstanding the above provisions, the letter of credit also may 
contain a clause providing for automatic termination 6 months after the 
royalty oil contract terminates. If a certificate of deposit is 
furnished as the surety instrument, it must be effective for the life of 
the contract plus 6 months after the royalty oil contract terminates.
    (c) For the purposes of this section, an ``MMS-specified surety 
instrument'' means either: an MMS-specified surety bond, an MMS-
specified irrevocable letter of credit, or a financial institution book-
entry certificate of deposit.
    (d) The ``MMS-specified surety instrument'' shall be in a form 
specified by MMS instructions or approved by MMS. A bond must be issued 
by a qualified surety company that has been approved by the Department 
of the Treasury. An irrevocable letter of credit or a certificate of 
deposit must be from a financial institution acceptable to MMS. The MMS 
will use a bank rating service to determine whether a financial 
institution has an acceptable rating to provide a surety instrument 
deemed adequate to indemnify the Government from loss or damage.
    (e) All surety instruments must be in a form acceptable to MMS and 
must include such other specific requirements as MMS may require 
adequately to protect the Government's interests.

<R05>
Sec. 208.12  Payment requirements.

    (a) All payments to MMS by a purchaser of royalty oil will be due on 
the date and at the location specified in the contract, or, if there is 
no contractual provision, as specified by MMS. The purchaser shall 
tender all payments to MMS in accordance with 30 CFR 218.51. Payments 
made by a payor

[[Page 172]]

pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 
208.13 also shall be tendered in accordance with 30 CFR 218.51.
    (b)(1) Payments from a purchaser of royalty oil not received by MMS 
when due, or that portion of the payment less than the full amount due, 
will be subject to a late payment charge equivalent to an interest 
assessment on the amount past due for the number of days that the 
payment is late at the underpayment rate applicable under section 6621 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (2) The MMS may assess interest to a payor for any underpayments 
which are the result of the payor's late or underreporting, or for 
adjustments reported by the payor, or made as a result of audit, 
reconciliation, or other procedures. The interest for late payment and 
underpayment will be assessed pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54.
    (c) If payment for royalty oil is not received by the due date 
specified in the contract, a notice of nonreceipt will be sent to the 
purchaser by certified mail. If payment is not received by MMS within 15 
days from the date of such notice, MMS may cancel the contract and 
collect under the MMS-specified surety instrument. See Sec. 208.11.
    (d) If the purchaser disagrees with the amount of payment due, it 
must pay the amount due as computed by MMS, unless the purchaser appeals 
the amount and posts an MMS-specified surety instrument pursuant to the 
provisions of 30 CFR part 243. The MMS may, at its discretion, waive the 
appeal surety requirements if it determines that the contract surety 
instrument is sufficient protection for an amount under appeal.

[52 FR 41913, Oct. 30, 1987, as amended at 64901, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 208.13  Reporting requirements.

    If MMS underbills a purchaser under a royalty oil contract because 
of a payor's underreporting or failure to report on Form MMS-2014 
pursuant to 30 CFR 210.52, the payor will be liable for payment of such 
underbilled amounts plus interest if they are unrecoverable from the 
purchaser or the surety instrument related to the contract.

[58 FR 64902, Dec. 10, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 208.14  Civil and criminal penalties.

    Failure to abide by the regulations in this part may result in civil 
and criminal penalties being levied on that person as specified in 
sections 109 and 110 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act 
of 1982, 30 U.S.C. 1719-20, and regulations at 30 CFR part 241. Civil 
penalties applicable under the OCSLA and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 
may also be imposed.


<R05>
Sec. 208.15  Audits.

    Audits of the accounts and books of lessees, operators, payors, and/
or purchasers of royalty oil taken in kind may be made annually or at 
such other times as may be directed by MMS. Such audits will be for the 
purpose of determining compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, 
and royalty oil contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 208.16  How to appeal a contracting officer's decision that you 
receive.

    If you receive a contracting officer's decision, you may:
    (a) Appeal that decision to the Board of Contract Appeals in the 
Office of Hearings and Appeals, Office of the Secretary, in accordance 
with the procedures provided in 43 CFR part 4, subpart C; or

forms identified in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (1) MMS-2014--Used monthly to report lease-related transactions 
essential for royalty management to determine the correct royalty amount 
due, reconcile or audit data, and distribute payments to appropriate 
accounts. Public reporting burden for paper submission is estimated to 
average 7 minutes to complete each line item on the form, including the 
time necessary to assemble data, calculate value and royalty, and enter 
data on the form. Companies reporting electronically may average 2 
minutes to complete each line item on the form. Comments submitted 
relative to this information collection should reference the information 
collection titled Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance, OMB Control 
Number 1010-0022.

submission is estimated to average 15 minutes per form, including the 
time necessary to assemble data, ensure that production and disposition 
numbers are accurate, and enter data on the form. Companies reporting 
electronically may average 7.5 minutes per month to complete the form. 
Comments submitted relative to this information collection should 
reference the information collection titled PAAS Oil and Gas Reports, 
OMB Control Number 1010-0040.
    (3) MMS-4025--This form is used to establish a data base of payor 
accounts for oil and gas leases on Federal or Indian lands, reporting 
changes in payor accounts, and notifying MMS of the products on which 
royalties will be paid. Public reporting burden is estimated to average 
30 minutes per form, including time spent reading instructions, 
completing, and mailing the form. Comments submitted relative to this 
information collection should reference Paperwork Reduction Project 
1010-0033.
    (4) MMS-4051--Used to establish a reference data base identifying 
the facilities where oil and gas production is stored or processed and 
the metering points where production is measured for sale or transfer. 
Public reporting burden is estimated to average 30 minutes per form for 
facility operators to review and update the data base. Comments 
submitted relative to this information collection should reference 
Paperwork Reduction Project 1010-0040.
    (5) MMS-4053--Designed as an audit tool to be used to confirm sales 
data. Public reporting burden is estimated to average 30 minutes per 
form, including time spent reading instructions, completing, and mailing 
the form. Comments submitted relative to this information collection 
should reference Paperwork Reduction Project 1010-0040.
    (6) MMS-4054--This three-part form identifies all oil and gas lease 
production from Federal and Indian lands. MMS uses information from this 
form to track oil and gas from the point of production to the point of 
first sale or other disposition. Respondents will generally not use all 
three parts of the form. Public reporting burden for paper submission is 
estimated to average 30 minutes per month, including the time necessary 
to assemble data, ensure that production and disposition numbers are 
accurate, and enter data on the form. Companies reporting electronically 
may average 15 minutes per month to complete the form. Comments 
submitted relative to this information collection should reference the 
information collection titled PAAS Oil and Gas Reports, OMB Control 
Number 1010-0040.
    (7) MMS-4055--This report identifies the separate components of 
natural gas production. It is submitted quarterly or semiannually by 
lease operators

[[Page 176]]

when gas production is processed before royalty value has been 
determined. Public reporting burden is estimated to average 15 minutes 
per form including time required gathering data, completing, and mailing 
the form. Comments submitted relative to this information collection 
should reference Paperwork Reduction Project 1010-0040.
    (8) MMS-4056--Submitted monthly by gas plant operators to identify 
components and disposition of natural gas from Federal and Indian 
leases. Public reporting burden is estimated to average 30 minutes per 
form, including time required gathering data, completing, and mailing 
the form. Comments submitted relative to this information collection 
should reference Paperwork Reduction Project 1010-0040.
    (9) MMS-4058--Submitted monthly by operators of the facilities and 
measurement points where production from a Federal or Indian lease is 
commingled with production from other sources before it is measured for 
royalty determination. The data reported is used to determine whether 
sales reported by lessees are reasonable. Public reporting burden is 
estimated to average 15 minutes per form, including time required 
gathering data, completing, and mailing the form. Comments submitted 
relative to this information collection should reference Paperwork 
Reduction Project 1010-0040.
    (10) MMS-4070--After publication in the Federal Register of a Notice 
of Availability of Royalty Oil, refiners interested in the purchase of 
royalty oil should submit their applications using this form. The 
information collected is used by MMS to determine if the applicant meets 
eligibility requirements to contract to purchase the oil. Public 
reporting burden is estimated to average 1 hour per form, including time 
required gathering data, completing, and mailing the form. Comments 
submitted relative to this information collection should reference 
Paperwork Reduction Project 1010-0042.
    (11) MMS-4109--Used to claim an allowance for the reasonable, actual 
costs of removing hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon elements or compounds

as Form MMS-2014 or bill document or to provide adequate information.

    (a) An assessment of an amount not to exceed $250 may be charged 
when the amount of a payment submitted by a payor is not equivalent in 
amount to the total of individual line items on the associated Form MMS 
2014 or bill document, unless the difference in amount has been 
authorized by MMS.
    (b) An assessment of an amount not to exceed $250 may be charged for

by AFS to the associated Form MMS-2014 or bill document because of 
inadequate or erroneous information submitted by the payor. For purposes 
of this section, inadequate or erroneous information is defined as:
    (1) Absent or incorrect payor assigned document number, required to

Sec. 218.42  Cross-lease netting in calculation of late-payment interest.

    (a) Interest due from a payor on any underpayment for any Federal 
mineral lease or leases (onshore or offshore) and on any Indian tribal 
mineral lease or leases for any production month shall not be reduced by 
offsetting against that underpayment any overpayment made by the payor 
on any other lease or leases, except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this section. Interest due from a payor or any underpayment on any 
Indian allotted lease shall not be reduced by offsetting against any 
overpayment on any other Indian allotted lease under any circumstances.
    (b) Royalties attributed to production from a lease or leases which 
should have been attributed to production from a different lease or 
leases may be offset to determine whether and to what extent an 
underpayment exists on which interest is due if the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The error results from attributing and reporting an equal volume 
of production, produced from a lease or leases during a particular 
production month, to a different lease or leases from which it was not 
produced for the same or another production month;
    (2) The payor is the same for the lease or leases to which 
production was attributed and the lease or leases to which it should 
have been attributed;
    (3) The payor submits production reports, pipeline allocation 
reports, or other similar documentary evidence pertaining to the 
specific production involved which verifies the correct production 
information;
    (4) The lessor is the same for the leases involved (in the case of 
Indian tribal leases, the same tribe is the lessor); and
    (5) The ultimate recipients of any royalty or other lease revenues 
under any applicable permanent indefinite appropriations are the same 
for, and receive the same percentage of revenue from, the leases.
    (c) If MMS assesses late-payment interest and the payor asserts that 
some or all of the interest assessed is not owed pursuant to the 
exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the burden is on 
the payor to demonstrate that the exception applies in the specific 
circumstances of the case.
    (d) The exception set forth in paragraph (b) of this section shall 
not operate to relieve any payor of liability imposed by statute or 
regulation for erroneous reporting.

the extent that it prevented the lessee or royalty payor from making an 
accurate royalty payment or submitting an accurate Form MMS-2014.
    (3) A lessee's or royalty payor's certification under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section that it is unable to generate and submit either 
an accurate royalty report or an accurate royalty payment will extend

Service, Minerals Revenue Management, P.O. Box 25165, MS 350B1, Denver, 
CO 80225-0165, or
    (ii) By e-mail to Robert.Prael@mms.gov.
    (e)(1) A lessee or royalty payor who submits a certification 
required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section may rely on the extended 
due dates prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section unless and 
until MMS notifies the lessee or royalty payor or operator that MMS does 
not accept the certification.
    (2) If MMS notifies the lessee or royalty payor that MMS does not 
accept the lessee's or royalty payor's certification under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the due date for royalty payments and Reports of 
Sales and Royalty Remittance will be the date specified in the notice.

Sec. 218.53  Recoupment of overpayments on Indian mineral leases.

    (a) Whenever an overpayment is made under an Indian oil and gas 
lease, a payor may recoup the overpayment through a recoupment on Form 
MMS-2014 against the current month's royalties or other revenues owed on 
the same lease. However, for any month a payor may not recoup more than 
50 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under 
an individual allotted lease or more than 100 percent of the royalties 
or other revenues owed in that month under a tribal lease.
    (b) With written permission authorized by tribal statute or 
resolution, a payor may recoup an overpayment against royalties or other 
revenues owed in that month under other leases for which that tribe is 
the lessor. A copy of the tribe's written permission must be furnished 
to MMS pursuant to instructions for reporting recoupments in the MMS 
revenue reporter handbook. See part 210 of this chapter. Recouping 
overpayments on one allotted lease from royalties paid to another 
allotted lease is specifically prohibited.
    (c) Overpayments subject to recoupment under this section include 
all payments made in excess of the required payment for royalty, rental, 
bonus, or other amounts owed as specified by statute, regulation, order,

    (d) The MMS Director or his/her designee may order any payor to not 
recoup any amount for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary 
for MMS to review the nature and amount of any claimed overpayment.

Continental Shelf, such information may be provided to the Minerals 
Management Service (MMS) in accordance with this paragraph. The MMS is 
authorized, under the Federal

[[Page 202]]

Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA), 30 U.S.C. 1723, to 
pay a reward for information with respect to Federal oil and gas leases. 
Funds must be appropriated before payment of any reward. Criteria and 
procedures covering claims for and payment of rewards are provided in 
paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
    (2) If a person has any information he or she believes would be 
valuable to MMS, that person (``informant'') should submit the 
information in writing, in the form of a letter, mailed or delivered in 
person to the Director, Minerals Management Service, Department of the 
Interior, 18th and C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, or to the 
Director's designated representative. Although written communications 
are preferred, oral information will be accepted.
    (3) The informant should provide all data he or she has with respect 
to royalty or other payments owed. The information provided should 
include: identification of the alleged debtor; the source of the 
informant's knowledge of royalties or other payments owed; the date, if 
known, of the indebtedness; and any other information that could be used 
to establish indebtedness. All information received by MMS from persons 
providing information will be considered ``highly confidential'' and 
will not be disclosed to any individual except on a ``need to know'' 
basis in the performance of official duties.
    (b) Claim for reward. (1) Any informant who provides information 
that could lead to the recovery of royalty or other payments may file a 
claim for reward unless the person is an officer or employee of the 
United States, an officer or employee of a State or Indian tribe acting 
pursuant to a cooperative agreement or delegation under the FOGRMA, or 
any person acting pursuant to a contract authorized by the FOGRMA.
    (2) A claim for reward is not acceptable if filed on behalf of a 
claimant by his or her agent under power of attorney. However, an agent 
may provide MMS with information for an unidentified informant, to be 
evaluated and used by MMS as it deems appropriate. The informant's 
identity ultimately must be disclosed if the informant intends to file a 
claim for reward so that MMS can report the reward as taxable income to 
the Internal Revenue Service. An executor, administrator, or other legal 
representative of a deceased informant may file a claim on behalf of 
such deceased informant if, prior to his or her death, the informant was 
eligible to file a claim under this section. The representative must 
attach to the claim evidence of authority to file it.
    (3) To file a claim for reward the informant must:
    (i) Notify the Director, MMS, or the person to whom the information 
was reported, that he/she is claiming a reward.
    (ii) Request an ``Application for Reward for Original Information'' 
(Form MMS-4280). This form provides for information to enable MMS to 
determine and pay rewards, to control reward applications, and to report 
a claimant's reward as taxable income to the Internal Revenue Service.
    (iii) File a claim for reward by completing Form MMS-4280, sign it 
with his or her true name, and mail or deliver it in person to the 
Director or to the Director's designated representative. If the 
informant provided the information in person, the claim should include 
the name and title of the person to whom the information was reported 
and the date that it was reported.
    (4) If the informant used an identity other than his or true name 
when the information was originally reported, the person should attach 
proof to the claim that he or she is the person who gave the 
information. The MMS does not disclose the identity of its informants to 
unauthorized persons.
    (c) Basis for rejection of claims. No reward will be paid to a 
claimant:
    (1) Where the information originally furnished was deemed unworthy 
of initiating an investigation, but at some later date the records of 
the lessee are examined without reference to the information furnished. 
The claim will be rejected on the basis that the information did not 
cause the investigation nor did it, in itself, result in any recovery.

[[Page 203]]

    (2) For information that would have been discovered during the 
normal course of an audit or investigation.
    (3) Unless the informant's true identity is disclosed.
    (4) Until after all of the royalties, penalties, or other payments 
discovered to be owed as a result of information provided are collected 
and no longer subject to dispute.
    (5) Unless funds are appropriated for the payment of rewards.
    (d) Basis for allowance of claims. (1) The value of the information 
furnished in relation to the facts developed by the investigation will 
be taken into account in determining whether a reward shall be paid and, 
if so, the amount thereof. Information must be voluntarily given and 
upon the informant's own initiative to warrant the allowance of a 
reward. Information secured by representatives of MMS from witnesses and 
others in the course of their investigative activities does not 
constitute a basis for reward.
    (2) In determining whether a reward will be allowed and, if so, the 
amount thereof, consideration will be given to any corresponding 
adjustment(s) which will result in potential savings to the lessee for 
other leases owned by the lessee or an affiliate of the lessee. An 
example of such an adjustment is a reduction in royalty payment on a 
different lease as the result of a revised allocation under a 
unitization or communitization agreement or from an offshore pipeline 
system. Rewards otherwise allowable will be reduced or rejected by 
reason of such offsetting adjustments.
    (3) If several claims filed by one informant are considered in one 
recommendation, the reward, if any, may be allowed on one claim and the 
others may be closed by reference.
    (4) Where an informant has provided information and filed a claim 
for reward with respect to royalty reports of one lessee for several 
leases, no reward will be granted with respect to an individual lease 
which has been examined until examination of all leases involved has 
been completed. Because the possibility exists that adjustments made to 
the reports for the open leases may result in offsetting adjustments, no 
reward will be allowed until the overall results of the information are 
evaluated.
    (e) Amount and payment of reward. (1) The Director, MMS will 
determine whether a reward will be paid and, if so, the amount thereof. 
In making this decision, the information provided will be evaluated in 
relation to the facts developed by the resulting investigation. Claims 
for reward will be paid in proportion to the value of information 
furnished voluntarily and on the informant's own initiative with respect 
to recovered royalties or other payments. The amount of reward will be 
determined as follows:
    (i) For specific and responsible information that caused the 
investigation and resulted in recovery, the reward will be 10 percent of 
the first $75,000 recovered, 5 percent of the next $25,000, and 1 
percent of any additional recovery. The total reward cannot exceed 
$100,000.
    (ii) For information that caused the examination and was of value in 
determining royalty or other payments due, although not specific, and 
for information that was a direct factor in recovering royalty or other 
payments, the reward will be 5 percent of the first $75,000 recovered, 
2\1/2\ percent of the next $25,000, and \1/2\ percent of any additional 
recovery. The total reward cannot exceed $100,000.
    (iii) For information that caused the investigation but was of no 
value in determining royalty or other payments due, the reward will be 1 
percent of the first $75,000 recovered and \1/2\ percent of any 
additional recovery. The total reward cannot exceed $100,000.
    (2) Rewards will be paid only if moneys are appropriated for that 
purpose. Subject to appropriations, payments will be made as soon as 
possible after collection of the amounts owed by the lessee, and after 
those amounts no longer are subject to dispute by the payor. The reward 
payment to an informant will be net of Federal and State income tax in 
accordance with withholding guidelines of the Internal Revenue Service 
and the applicable State(s).
    (3) A decision by the Director, MMS, either denying a reward or 
establishing

[[Page 204]]

the amount of any reward is a final departmental action and may not be 
appealed to the Interior Board of Land Appeals in accordance with the 
provisions of 30 CFR part 290.

assessment shall be first against monies owed to such State as a result 
of royalty audits prior to January 12, 1983, the enactment date of the

    (c) For leases issued subject to the net profit sharing provisions, 
annual rental payments shall be due and payable in advance, on the first 
day of each lease year which commences prior to the date the first 
profit share payment becomes due. The owner of any lease created by the 
segregation of a portion of a lease subject to net profit sharing 
provisions, shall pay an annual rental for such segregated portion at 
the rate per acre or hectare specified in the lease. This rental shall 
be payable each year following the year in which the segregation becomes 
effective and shall continue to be due and payable, in advance, on the 
first day of each year which commences prior to the date the first 
profit share payment becomes due.

    (1) Grants a suspension of operations or production, or both, at the 
request of the lessee; or
    (2) Directs a suspension of operations or production, or both, under 
30 CFR 250.173(a).
    (b) MMS will not require a lessee to pay rental or minimum royalty 
for or during the suspension if the Regional Supervisor directs a 
suspension of operations or production, or both, except as provided in 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (c) If the lease anniversary date falls within a period of 
suspension for which no rental or minimum royalty payments are required 
under paragraph (a) of this section, the prorated rentals or minimum 
royalties are due and payable as of the date the suspension period 
terminates. These amounts shall be computed and notice thereof given the 
lessee. The lessee shall pay the amount due within 30 days after receipt 
of such notice. The anniversary date of a lease shall not change by 
reason of any period of lease suspension or rental or royalty relief 
resulting therefrom.

<R05>
Sec. 218.155  Method of payment.

    (a) Payment of royalties and rentals. With the exception of first-
year rental, the payor shall tender all payments in accordance with 
Sec. 218.51. First-year rental shall be paid in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Payment of the one-fifth bonus bid amount. (1) Each lease bid 
must include a payment for the one-fifth bonus bid deposit amount unless 
the bidder is otherwise directed by the Secretary. Further instructions 
on how to make payment with the bid will be included in the notice of 
each lease offering. EFT may be used as a method of payment for the one-
fifth bonus bid amount.
    (2) Beginning with lease offerings held after February 1, 1984, the 
one-fifth bonus amount received from a high bidder shall be deposited 
into an escrow account created pursuant to an agreement between the 
Departments of the Interior and Treasury, pending acceptance or 
rejection of the bid. The one-fifth bonus funds will be invested in 
public debt securities. Investment of this amount by the U.S. Government 
does not indicate acceptance of the bid. The one-fifth bonus checks 
submitted with bids other than the highest valid bid shall be returned 
to respective bidders after bids are opened, recorded, and ranked. 
Return of such checks will not affect the status, validity, or ranking 
of bids. The one-fifth bonus bid amount received from any high bidder 
and held by the Government pending acceptance or rejection, will be 
returned with actual interest earned, if the bid is subsequently 
rejected. The interest accrued during the period held in the account 
pending acceptance or rejection of the bid will accrue to the Government 
when the bid is accepted.
    (c) Payment of the four-fifths bonus bid amount and the first year's 
rental. Payment shall be made to MMS by EFT unless otherwise directed by 
the Secretary. The payment by EFT via the FRCS must be received by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York no later than noon, eastern standard 
time, on the 11th business day after receipt of the lease forms by the 
successful bidder. A ``business day'' is considered to be a day on which 
the OCS regional office issuing the lease is open for business. The 
lease will not be executed by the appropriate MMS official until payment 
is received. Failure to remit by EFT or as directed by the Secretary 
within the time specified above will result in forfeiture of the one-
fifth bonus bid amount and the lease will not be

[[Page 208]]

executed by the appropriate MMS official. Payors will not be held 
responsible for late payment due to actions beyond their control, such 
as mechanical or systems failure of FRCS or FDS. Payors will be held 
responsible for incorrect actions of their bank which result in late 
payments. A 2-day grace period will be allowed to make up a deficient 
payment, but a late payment charge will be assessed for this late 
payment and a penalty will also be assessed if appropriate. Late payment 
charges will be assessed in accordance with Subpart B of this part.
    (d) General. (1) Payors using the appropriate means of payment (EFT, 
check, etc.) may pay for multiple lease obligations with a single 
remittance but must ensure that the payment complies with subpart B of 
this part and the remittance advice adequately identifies the single 
payment. The format to be used for such identification will be provided 
by the MMS Accounting Center.
    (2) Where to pay.
    (3) The MMS mailing addresses for payments to MMS are specified in 
Sec. 218.51.
    (4) Payments received at the MMS addresses after 4 p.m. mountain 
time are considered received the following business day.
    (e) Miscellaneous payments. Payments shall be made to the manager of 
the appropriate Outer Continental Shelf field office by cash, check or 
bank draft payable to ``Department of the Interior--MMS'' for 
miscellaneous payments such as:
    (1) Pipeline rights-of-way application filing fees and rentals, 
pipeline accessory site rentals and application fees, and other related 
costs.
    (2) Filing and approval fees for transfers of interest in leases.

Sec. 218.202  Late payment or underpayment charges.

    (a) The failure to make timely or proper payment of any monies due 
pursuant to leases and contracts subject to these rules will result in 
the collection by MMS of the full amount past due plus a late payment 
charge. Exceptions to this late payment charge may be granted when 
estimated payments on minerals production have already been made timely 
and otherwise in accordance with instructions provided by MMS to the 
operator/lessee. However, late payment charges assessed with respect to 
any Indian lease, permit, or contract shall be collected and paid to the 
Indian or tribe to which the amount overdue is owed.

[[Page 209]]

    (b) Late payment charges will be assessed on any late payment or 
underpayment from the date that the payment was due until the date that 
the payment was received at the MMS addresses specified in Sec. 218.51. 
Payments received at the specified MMS addresses after 4 p.m. mountain 
time are considered received the following business day.
    (c) Late payment charges are calculated on the basis of a percentage 
assessment rate. In the absence of a specific lease, permit, license or 
contract provision prescribing a different rate, this percentage 
assessment rate is prescribed by the Department of the Treasury as the 
``Treasury Current Value of Funds Rate.''
    (d) This rate is available in the Treasury Fiscal Requirements 
Manual Bulletins that are published prior to the first day of each 
calendar quarter for application to overdue payments or underpayments in 
the new calendar quarter. The rate is also published in the Notices 
section of the Federal Register and indexed under ``Fiscal Service/
Notices/Funds Rate; Treasury Current Value.''
    (e) Late payment charges apply to all underpayments and payments 
received after the date due. These charges include production, minimum, 
or advance royalties; assessments for liquidated damages; or any other 
payments, fees, or assessments that an operator/lessee is required to 
pay by a specified date. The failure to pay past due payments, including 
late payment charges, will result in the initiation of other enforcement 
proceedings.
    (f) An overpayment on a lease or leases may be offset against an 
underpayment on a different lease or leases to determine a net 
underpayment on which interest is due pursuant to conditions specified 
in Sec. 218.42.

Sec. 218.203  Recoupment of overpayments on Indian mineral leases.

    (a) Whenever an overpayment is made under an Indian solid mineral 
lease, a payor may recoup the overpayment through a recoupment on Form 
MMS-4430 against the current month's royalties or other revenues owed on 
the same lease. However, for any month a payor may not recoup more than 
50 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under 
an individual allotted lease or more than 100 percent of the royalties 
or other revenues owed in that month under a tribal lease.
    (b) With written permission authorized by tribal statute or 
resolution, a payor may recoup an overpayment against royalties or other 
revenues owed in that month under other leases for which that tribe is 
the lessor. A copy of the tribe's written permission must be furnished 
to MMS for reporting recoupments. Call 1-888-201-6416 for instructions. 
Recouping overpayments on one allotted lease from royalties paid to 
another allotted lease is specifically prohibited.
    (c) Overpayments subject to recoupment under this section include 
all payments made in excess of the required payment for royalty, rental, 
bonus, or other amounts owed as specified by statute, regulation, order, 
or terms of an Indian mineral lease.
    (d) The MMS Director or his/her designee may order any payor to not 
recoup any amount for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary 
for MMS to review the nature and amount of any claimed overpayment.

received after the date due. These charges include production, minimum, 
and compensatory royalties; assessments for liquidated damages; 
administrative fees and payments by purchasers of royalty taken-in-kind; 
or any other payments, fees, or assessments that a lessee/operator/
payor/royalty taken-in-kind purchaser is required to pay by a specified 
date. The failure to pay past due payments, including late payment 
charges, will result in the initiation of other enforcement proceedings.

Sec. 220.002  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part 220:
    Allowance for capital recovery means the amount calculated according 
to procedures specified in Sec. 220.020. This amount allows a premium 
for risk initially undertaken by the lessee and a return on investment 
made during the capital recovery period. It is provided in lieu of 
interest on equipment and materiel charged to the NPSL capital account.
    Capital recovery period means the period of time that begins on the 
date of issuance of the NPSL and ends on the last day of the month 
during which the sooner of the following occurs:
    (1) The lessee completes the last well on the first platform 
specified in the development and production plan originally approved by 
the MMS, with any approved amendments thereto, and installation of 
wellhead equipment. In the event the last well is dry, then the capital 
recovery period shall be deemed to have ended with the determination 
that the last well is non-productive;
    (2) The balance in the NPSL capital account changes from a debit 
balance to a credit balance; or
    (3) The lessee, at his election, chooses to terminate the capital 
recovery period. A decision to terminate the capital recovery period 
prior to the events specified in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this

all allowable costs and adding all allowable credits (including 
production revenue) in accordance with the procedures established by 
this part 220.
    Net profit share payment means the portion of the net profit share 
base payable to the United States.
    Net profit share rate means the percentage share of the net profit 
share base payable to the United States. The percentage share may be

considered sufficient approval for these other costs provided they are 
separately identified in said plan of development and production. Such 
separate identification shall note the nature of

[[Page 219]]

these other costs and may include an estimate of their magnitude. Any 
cost approvals under this paragraph for which the specific amounts have 
not been itemized are presumed to be approved provided they fall within 
the limits for a prudent operator. Approval of costs under this 
paragraph shall be approval solely for the purposes of determining 
allowable costs and shall not preclude a subsequent adjustment at audit 
of the amount of such costs.
    (p) Other credits. Credit shall be given to the NPSL capital 
account, depending on when it is incurred, for NPSL property leased or

75 percent of current Condition A price.
    (B) Materiel transferred from the NPSL project area shall be priced:
    (1) At 75 percent of current Condition A price, if the materiel was 
originally charged to NPSL operations as Condition A materiel, or
    (2) At 65 percent of current Condition A price, if the materiel was 
originally charged to NPSL operations as Condition B materiel at 75 
percent of current Condition A price.
    (iii) Conditions C and D (other used) materiel--(A) Condition C. 
Materiel that is not in sound and serviceable condition and not suitable 
for its original function until after reconditioning shall be priced at 
50 percent of current Condition A price.

[[Page 221]]

    (B) Condition D. Materiel no longer suitable for its original 
purposes but suitable for some other purpose shall be priced on a basis 
commensurate with its use and comparable with that of materiel normally 
used for such other purpose. If the materiel has no alternative use it 
should be priced at prevailing prices as scrap.
    (iv) Obsolete materiel. Materiel that is serviceable and usable for 
its original function and has a value less than Condition A, B, or C 
materiel may be valued at a price agreed to by the Director. Such price 
should be the equivalent of the value of the service rendered by such 
materiel.
    (b) Pricing conditions. (1) Loading and unloading costs shall be 
charged at a rate of 15 cents per hundred weight, or such other rate as 
may be set by the Director, on all tubular goods movements, in lieu of 
loading/unloading costs sustained, when the actual hauling costs of such 
tubular goods is equalized under provisions of Sec. 220.011(d).
    (2) Materiel involving erection costs shall be charged at the 
applicable percentage of the current knocked-down price of new materiel.
    (c) When materiel subject to paragraphs (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of 
this section is transferred, the cost of reconditioning shall be borne 
by the receiving party.


<R05>
Sec. 220.020  Calculation of the allowance for capital recovery.

    (a) For purposes of this section, the cost base for the allowance 
for capital recovery in a particular month shall consist of the sum of:
    (1) All allowable direct and allocable joint costs chargeable to the 
NPSL capital account during the month less any costs specified in Sec. 
220.012(c); plus
    (2) The value of contract services chargeable to the NPSL capital 
account during the month pursuant to Sec. 220.011(e); plus
    (3) The capital recovery period overhead allowance, calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 220.012(a), that is chargeable to the NPSL capital 
account for the month; less
    (4) Production revenues and other credits received during the month.
    (b) If the cost base for a month is greater than zero (that is, if 
the sum of the charges specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of 
this section exceeds the value of production revenues and other 
credits), the allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated by 
multiplying the cost base by the capital recovery factor, and shall be 
debited to the NPSL capital account as specified in Sec. 220.021(b).
    (c) If the cost base for a month is less than zero, the allowance 
for capital recovery for the NPSL capital account shall be calculated by 
multiplying the resulting negative cost base by the capital recovery 
factor. The negative product of this calculation shall be debited to the 
NPSL capital account as specified in Sec. 220.021(b).
    (d) No allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated on the 
charges or credits related to any time period after the end of the 
capital recovery period.


<R05>
Sec. 220.021  Determination of net profit share base.

    (a) During each month of the lease term, the NPSL capital account 
shall be:
    (1) Debited with allowable direct and allocable joint costs;
    (2) Credited with an amount reflecting the production revenues for 
the month, calculated in accordance with Sec. 260.110(b) of this 
chapter.
    (3) Credited with amounts properly credited back to the NPSL capital 
account as specified in Sec. 220.011(p). Credits associated with 
charges to the NPSL capital account during the capital recovery period, 
however, shall first be increased by the value of the credit multiplied 
by the recovery factor, before crediting that sum to the NPSL capital 
account.
    (b) At the end of each month of the lease term during the capital 
recovery period:
    (1) The transactions specified in paragraph (a) of this section 
shall be made to the NPSL capital account.
    (2) The capital recovery period overhead allowance shall be 
calculated in accordance with Sec. 220.012(a) and debited to the NPSL 
capital account.
    (3) The allowance for capital recovery shall be calculated in 
accordance with Sec. 220.020 and the allowance debited

[[Page 222]]

(or the negative allowance debited, as appropriate) to the NPSL capital 
account. (A debit entry of a negative allowance for capital recovery 
shall have the same effect as a credit entry of the absolute value of 
the allowance for capital recovery.)
    (4) The balance in the NPSL capital account shall be calculated. If, 
as a result of the accounting transactions described in paragraphs (b) 
(1) through (3) of this section, there is a credit balance in the NPSL 
capital account, the capital recovery period will be considered 
terminated as of this month. The credit balance will be forwarded to the 
next month, which will be the first month for which a profit share 
payment is due.
    (c) At the end of each month of the lease term following the end of 
the capital recovery period:
    (1) The transaction specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall 
be made to the NPSL capital account.
    (2) An overhead allowance shall be calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 220.012(b) and debited to the NPSL capital account.
    (3) The balance in the NPSL capital account shall be calculated.
    (d) If, as a result of the accounting transactions described in 
paragraph (c) of this section, there is a credit balance in the NPSL 
capital account, this credit balance is the net profit share base for 
that month. The opening debit and credit balances in the NPSL capital 
account for any month following a month in which there is a credit 
balance in the NPSL capital account (except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(4)) of this section shall be zero.
    (e) If, as a result of the accounting transactions described in 
paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, there is a debit balance in the 
NPSL capital account, this debit balance shall be the opening debit 
balance in the NPSL capital account for the following month.
    (f) Any credit balance in the NPSL capital account shall become the 
net profit share base as described in this section. Any debit balance in 
the NPSL capital account shall be maintained only insofar as necessary 
for the determination of profit share payments. Such debit balance shall 
not represent a claim against the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 220.022  Calculation of net profit share payment.

    The net profit share payment shall be calculated by multiplying the 
net profit share base calculated in accordance with Sec. 220.021 by the 
net profit share rate. The net profit share payment shall be paid to the 
United States in accordance with Sec. 220.031.


<R05>
Sec. 220.030  Maintenance of records.

    (a) Each lessee subject to this part 220 shall establish and 
maintain such records as are necessary to determine for each NPSL:

the method used to calculate the amount of each charge made under Sec. 
220.011(g);
    (5) The cumulative balance of costs and credits to the NPSL capital 
account; and
    (6) The inventory of materiel.
    (b) The ledger cards showing the charges and credits to the NPSL 
capital account shall be maintained until thirty-six months after the 
cessation of NPSL operations by the lessee. All other documents, 
journals and records shall be maintained for thirty-six months from the 
due date or date of mailing of the statement of account on an NPSL, 
whichever comes later, except that nothing in these regulations shall 
limit the time of investigation or the need to produce records when 
prima facie evidence of fraud or willful

[[Page 223]]

misconduct is obtained with respect to the government's interest in the 
NPSL.


<R05>
Sec. 220.031  Reporting and payment requirements.

    (a) Each lessee subject to this part shall file an annual report 
during the period from issuance of the NPSL until the first month in 
which production revenues are credited to the NPSL capital account. Such 
report shall list the costs incurred, including allowances applied, 
credits received, and the balance of the NPSL capital account. Not later 
than 60 days after the end of the first month in which production 
revenues are credited to the NPSL capital account, a final report 
relating to the period shall be filed.
    (b) Beginning with the first month in which production revenues are 
credited to the NPSL capital account, each lessee subject to this part 
220 shall file a report for each NPSL, not later than 60 days following 
the end of each month, containing the following information for the 
month for which the report is filed:
    (1) The volume and disposition of all oil and gas production saved, 
removed or sold;
    (2) The production revenue;
    (3) The amount and description of all costs and credits to the NPSL 
capital account;
    (4) The balance of the NPSL capital account; and
    (5) The net profit share base and net profit share payment due the 
United States and the monthly profit share of the lessee.
    (c) Each lessee subject to this part 220 shall submit, together with 
the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, any net profit 
share payment due the United States for the period covered by the 
report.
    (d) Each lessee subject to this part 220 shall file a report not 
later than 90 days after each inventory is taken, reporting the 
controllable materiel on hand, acquired, transferred or used.
    (e) Each lessee subject to this part 220 shall file a final report, 
not later than 60 days following the cessation of production, together 
with the appropriate net profit share payment, indicating the remaining 
balance and costs and credits to the NPSL capital account for the 
period.
    (f) Reports required by this section shall be filed with the 
Director, either separately or as part of the reports that are currently 
filed.
    (g) Interest shall be calculated at the prevailing rate or rates as 
published in the Bulletin to the Department of the Treasury Fiscal 
Requirement Manual, in effect for the period or periods over which the 
net profit share payment is owed, compounded monthly, on the amount of a 
net profit share payment, from the due date (60 days following the end 
of each month for which the payment was due) of a net profit share 
payment until such payment is received by the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 220.032  Inventories.

    (a) The lessee is responsible for NPSL materiel and shall make 
proper and timely cost and credit notations for all materiel movements 
affecting NPSL property. The lessee shall provide only such materiel as 
may be required for immediate use or is consistent with practical, 
efficient, and economical operations. The accumulation of surplus stocks 
shall be avoided by proper materiel control, inventory and purchasing. 
The lessee shall make timely disposition of idle and surplus materiel 
through sale.
    (b) At reasonable intervals, but at least once every three years, 
inventories of controllable materiel shall be taken by the lessee. 
Written notice of intention to take inventory shall be given by the 
lessee at least 30 days before any inventory is to be taken so that the 
Director may be represented at the taking of inventory. Failure of the 
Director to be represented at an inventory shall bind the Director to 
accept the inventory taken by the lessee, except in the case of willful 
misrepresentation or fraud.
    (c) Inventory shall be valued with any generally accepted accounting 
method used by the lessee to value the same materiel for financial or 
income tax reporting purposes, provided that the method is consistently 
applied throughout the life of the materiel.
    (d) Reconciliation shall be made of a physical inventory with the 
NPSL capital account by the lessee, and a list of

[[Page 224]]

overages and shortages shall be available to the Director for audit as 
provided in Sec. 220.033. Inventory adjustments of controllable 
materiel shall be made by the lessee to the NPSL capital account for 
overages and shortages. Controllable materiel removed from physical 
inventory that has not been credited to NPSL operations under Sec. 
220.015(a)(2) shall be credited to NPSL operations at its original 
value, except that when the cost of the materiel originally qualified 
for the allowance for capital recovery in Sec. 220.020, the credit 
shall be calculated pursuant to Sec. 220.021(a)(3).


<R05>
Sec. 220.033  Audits.

    (a) The accounts of an NPSL lessee or of a contractor of the lessee 
which are related to NPSL operations shall be subject to audit by DOI or 
its appointed agent. Where possible, the auditor for DOI shall 
coordinate audit efforts with other nonoperators, if any. DOI shall have 
the right to initiate an audit any time within thirty-six months of the 
due date of the monthly statement that is to be audited or the date that 
the statement was mailed, whichever is later, provided, however, that 
audits may not be conducted any more frequently than once every year 
except upon a showing of fraud or willful misrepresentation.
    (b)(1) When nonoperators of an NPSL lease call an audit in 
accordance with the terms of their operating agreement, the Director 
shall be notified of the audit call in the same manner as the operator 
is notified. DOI may elect to send an auditor with the audit team 
specified by the nonoperators in lieu of calling for a separate audit by 
DOI.
    (2) If DOI determines to call for an audit, DOI shall notify the 
lessee of its audit call and set a time and place for the audit. Such a 
notice shall be sent at least thirty days before the suggested time for 
the audit to allow the nonoperators to join in DOI's audit in lieu of 
calling for their own audit. The place for the audit will normally be 
the place where the lessee maintains its records pertaining to the NPSL 
lease. The lessee shall send copies of the notice to the nonoperators on 
the lease. The lessee shall use reasonable effort to notify all 
nonoperators, but failure to include one or more nonoperators in the 
notification shall not void the notice.
    (3) When DOI calls for an audit, DOI may suggest the date and time 
when the audit may commence. The estimated duration of the audit may be 
mentioned to the lessee as well as to the other nonoperators who may 
elect to supply and auditor for their own audit purposes. The lessee's 
office where the audit will be held may be named or, if not known, 
inquired about. If a visit to a field plant or field office is 
contemplated by the government auditor, such a field trip may be 
mentioned. If DOI expresses a desire to review a period on which the 
thirty-six month time limitation has expired, it is the lessee's 
prerogative to allow the review or to request that DOI adhere to the 
time limitation specified in these regulations.
    (c)(1) Exceptions to the accounting by the lessee, whether in favor 
of the government or the lessee, shall be noted in a report to the 
lessee. The lessee shall have 60 days from the mailing of a notice of 
exceptions to agree to the adjustments proposed by the DOI auditor or to 
object to the proposed adjustments. If the lessee accepts the proposed 
adjustments, the adjustment shall be booked in the month in which the 
lessee agrees to the adjustment, except where such adjustment would have 
resulted in a change in any net profit share payment due the United 
States. In such a case, there shall be a redetermination of the NPSL 
capital account pursuant to Sec. 220.034.
    (2) If the lessee disagrees with the adjustment, the lessee shall 
have the right to appeal the adjustment to the Director.
    (d) Upon receipt of an agreement by the government auditor that 
there are no required audit adjustments, upon final determination with 
respect to any audit adjustment proposed by the government auditor, or 
upon the lapse of thirty-six months from the due date or date of mailing 
of the statement of account on an NPSL lease, whichever comes later, the 
books shall be closed for audit adjustment purposes, except upon a 
showing of fraud or willful misrepresentation.

[[Page 225]]

    (e) Records required to be kept under Sec. 220.030(a) shall be made 
available for inspection by any authorized agent of DOI at any time 
during normal business hours upon the request of the Director or other 
authorized official.


<R05>
Sec. 220.034  Redetermination and appeals.

    (a) If, as a result of an inspection of records or an audit under 
Sec. 220.033, the Director determines that there is an error in the 
NPSL capital account or an error in calculating the net profit share 
payment, whether in favor of the government or the lessee, the Director 
shall redetermine the net profit share base and recalculate the net 
profit share payment due the United States and notify the lessee of the 
recalculation.
    (b) The lessee shall pay any additional amount of net profit share 
payment owed plus interest, compounded monthly, from the date that the 
payment was due until the date it is actually paid. Interest shall be 
calculated at the prevailing rate or rates as published in the Bulletin 
to the Department of the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, in effect 
for the period or periods over which the payment is owed.
    (c) If the recalculated profit share payment is less than the amount 
paid the United States, the lessee shall apply such overpayment to the 
next profit share payment.
    (d) Within 30 days after receiving notice of the recalculation as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the lessee may appeal the 
decision of the Director in accordance with the appeals provision of 30 
CFR part 290.

                   Delegation of MMS Royalty Functions


<R05>
Sec. 227.1  What is the purpose of this part?

    This part provides procedures to delegate Federal royalty management 
functions to States under section 205 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty 
Management Act of 1982 (the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1735, as amended by the 
Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996, 
Pub. L. 104-185, August 13, 1996, as corrected by Pub. L. 104-200. This 
part also provides procedures to delegate only audit and investigation 
functions to States under Pub. L. 102-154 for solid mineral leases, 
geothermal leases and leases subject to section 8(g) of the Outer 
Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337(g). This part does not apply 
to any inspection or enforcement responsibilities of the Bureau of Land 
Management for onshore leases or the MMS Offshore Minerals Management 
program for leases on the Outer Continental Shelf.


<R05>
Sec. 227.10  What is the authority for information collection?

    (a) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
have been approved by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 
U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned OMB Control Number 1010-0088. We will 
use the information collected to review and approve delegation proposals 
from States wishing to perform royalty management functions.
    (b) Public reporting burden is estimated as follows. MMS estimates 
400 annual burden hours per function for each State performing the 
delegated functions. The Federal Government will reimburse some of these 
costs as provided by statute. However, States could incur additional 
start-up costs, such as purchasing equipment necessary to perform a 
delegated function, that may not be reimbursable. MMS estimates that, if 
applicable, each payor or reporter would spend 50 burden hours annually 
coordinating their interactions and communications among the several 
States and with MMS. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any 
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions 
for reducing burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, 
Minerals Management Service, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240; 
and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of 
Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Interior 
Department, OMB Control Number 1010-0088, 725 17th Street, NW., 
Washington, DC 20503.


<R05>
Sec. 227.101  What royalty management functions may MMS delegate to a 
State?

    (a) If there are oil and gas leases subject to the Act on Federal 
lands within your State, MMS may delegate the following royalty 
management functions for all such Federal oil and gas leases to you 
under this part:
    (1) Receiving and processing production or royalty reports;
    (2) Correcting erroneous report data; and
    (3) Performing automated verification.
    (b) If there are oil and gas leases subject to the Act on Federal 
lands within your State, MMS may delegate the following royalty 
management functions for some or all of the Federal oil and gas leases 
to you under this part:
    (1) Conducting audits and investigations; and
    (2) Issuing demands, subpoenas, and orders to perform restructured 
accounting, including related notices to lessees or their designees, and 
entering into tolling agreements under section 115(d)(1) of the Act, 30 
U.S.C. 1725(d)(1).
    (c) If there are oil and gas leases offshore of your State subject 
to section 8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337 
(g), or solid mineral leases or geothermal leases on Federal lands 
within your State, MMS

[[Page 227]]

may delegate authority to conduct audits and investigations for some or 
all such Federal leases.

[64 FR 36784, July 8, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 227.102  What royalty management functions will MMS not delegate?

    This section lists the principal royalty management functions that 
MMS will not delegate to a State. MMS will not delegate to a State the 
following functions:
    (a) MMS must collect all moneys received from sales, bonuses, 
rentals, royalties, civil penalties, assessments and interest. MMS also 
must collect any moneys a lessee or its designee pays because of audits 
or other actions of a delegated State;
    (b) MMS must compare all cash and other payments it receives with 
payments shown on royalty reports or other documents, such as bills, to 
reconcile payor accounts. MMS also must disburse all appropriate moneys 
to States and other revenue recipients, including refunds and interest 
owed to lessees and their designees;
    (c) The Department of the Interior will receive, process, and decide 
all administrative appeals from demands or other orders issued to 
lessees, their designees, or any other person, including demands or 
orders a delegated State issues;
    (d) Only MMS may take enforcement actions other than issuing 
demands, subpoenas and orders to perform restructured accounting. MMS or 
the appropriate Federal agency will issue notices of non-compliance and 
civil penalties, collect debts, write off delinquent debts, pursue 
litigation, enforce subpoenas, and manage any alternative dispute 
resolution. MMS will conduct, coordinate and approve any settlement or 
other compromise of an obligation that a lessee or its designee owes;
    (e) MMS will decide all valuation policies, including issuing 
valuation regulations, determinations, and guidelines, and interpreting 
valuation regulations; and
    (f) MMS may reserve additional authorities and responsibilities not 
included in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.

                          Delegation Proposals


<R05>
Sec. 227.103  What must a State's delegation proposal contain?

    If you want MMS to delegate royalty management functions to you, 
then you must submit a delegation proposal to the MMS Associate Director 
for Minerals Revenue Management. MMS will provide you with technical

associations to distribute to their members.
    (b) You may ask MMS to renew the delegation for an additional 3 
years no less than 6 months before your 3-year delegation agreement 
expires. You must submit your renewal request to the MMS Associate 
Director for Minerals Revenue Management as follows:
    (1) If you do not want to change the terms of your delegation 
agreement for the renewal period, you need only ask to extend your 
existing agreement for the 3-year renewal period. MMS will not schedule

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 228.1  Purpose.

    It is the purpose of cooperative agreements to effectively utilize 
the capabilities of the States and Indian tribes in developing and 
maintaining an efficient and effective Federal royalty management system 
as indicated at 30 U.S.C. 1701.


<R05>
Sec. 228.2  Policy.

    It shall be the policy of DOI to enter into cooperative agreements 
with States and Indian tribes to carry out audits and related 
investigations and enforcement actions whenever a State or tribe 
initiates a request to enter into an agreement and a finding is made 
that a State or tribe has the ability to carry out cooperative 
activities in a timely and efficient manner.


<R05>
Sec. 228.3  Limitation on applicability.

    As of the effective date of this rule, September 11, 1997, this part 
does not apply to Federal lands.

[62 FR 43091, Aug. 12, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 228.4  Authority.

    The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to enter into 
cooperative agreements with States and Indian tribes (30 U.S.C. 1732) to 
share oil or gas royalty management information, and to carry out 
auditing and related investigation or enforcement activities in 
cooperation with the Secretary.


<R05>
Sec. 228.5  Delegation of authority.

    (a) Authority to enter into cooperative agreements to carry out 
audit and related investigation and enforcement activities with State 
and tribal governments has been delegated to the Director of the 
Minerals Management Service (MMS).
    (b) Authority to enter into cooperative agreements with State and 
tribal governments to carry out inspection and related investigation and 
enforcement activities has been delegated to the Director of the Bureau 
of Land Management (BLM) and is not covered by this part.
    (c) The entry into a cooperative agreement with either MMS or BLM 
will not affect the ability of a State or Indian tribe to choose to 
enter into such an agreement with the other agency. A State may enter 
into a delegation agreement (30 U.S.C. 1735) with MMS to perform certain 
functions without affecting its ability to enter into a cooperative 
agreement with either MMS or BLM, or both, to cooperate in the 
performance of those functions which are not delegated in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 228.6  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part, terms shall have the same meaning as 
in 30

[[Page 238]]

U.S.C. 1702. In addition, the following definition shall apply:
    Audit means an examination of the financial accounting and lease 
related records of the lessee and other interest holders, who by lease 
or contract pay royalties or are obligated to pay royalties, rents, 
bonuses or other payments on Federal or Indian leases. An examination is 
to be conducted in accordance with generally accepted audit standards as 
adopted by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
Activities to be examined which are considered to be an audit function 
include reconciliation of lease accounts under the Royalty Accounting 
System; records of lease activities related to Federal leases located 
within the boundaries of the State entering into a cooperative 
agreement; records of lease activities related to leases located on 
Indian lands, and the review and resolution of exceptions processed by 
the official accounting systems for royalty reporters and payors 
maintained by the MMS.

Sec. 228.10  Information collection.

    (a) The information collection requirements contained in this part 
have been approved by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned OMB 
Clearance Number 1010-0087. The information collected will be used to 
prepare a cooperative agreement with a State or Indian tribe wishing to 
perform royalty audits. The information should be submitted voluntarily 
in order to enter into a cooperative agreement authorized by 30 U.S.C. 
1732.
    (b) Public reporting burden is estimated to average 136 hours for 
the preparation of the original request for consideration and 
application to enter into a cooperative agreement. Subsequent requests 
for renewal of the agreement may require about 40 hours for the 
preparation of an annual budget and work plan, and an estimated 8 hours 
per quarter for preparation of a reimbursement voucher and an audit 
progress report. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any 
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions 
for reducing burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer,

by the State or Indian tribe in carrying out the provisions of the 
agreement. The State or Indian tribe will be given 60 days to respond to 
the notice of deficiencies and to provide a plan for correction of those 
deficiencies. No final action on termination shall be taken until any 
submission of the State or Indian tribe provided within the above 
prescribed 60 days has been reviewed by MMS for content or merit.
    (e) Termination of a cooperative agreement shall not bar a later 
request by a State or Indian tribe to enter into a subsequent

[56 FR 10512, Mar. 13, 1991]


<R05>
Sec. 228.104  Availability of information.

    (a) Under the provisions of this part, information necessary to 
carry out the activities authorized under the terms of a cooperative 
agreement will be provided by DOI to the States and Indian tribes 
entering into such agreements. The information will consist of data 
provided from all relevant sources on a lease level basis for leases 
located within the boundaries of the State or Indian tribe which has 
entered into the agreement. This information will include any records or 
data held by the lessee or other person that have not been submitted to 
MMS, but that affect Federal lease interests and could be required to be 
submitted under the lease terms or Federal regulations.
    (b) None of the provisions of this subpart should be construed as 
limiting information already being provided to Indian tribes and 
allottees regarding their lease interests.
    (c) Information will be provided by MMS on a monthly basis and will 
include data on royalties, rents, and bonuses collected on the lease, 
volumes produced, sales made, value of products disposed of as a sale

must--
    (1) Demonstrate what audit, investigation, or litigation under 
provisions of 30 U.S.C. 1734 is planned for or underway for which this 
data is essential;

agreement, reimburse the State or Indian tribe up to 100 percent of the 
costs of eligible activities. Eligible activities will be agreed upon 
annually upon the submission and approval of a workplan and funding 
requirement.
    (2) A cooperative agreement may be entered into with a State or 
Indian tribe, upon request, without a requirement for reimbursement of 
costs by the Department.
    (b) All cooperative agreements under this part are subject to annual 
funding and the availability of appropriations specifically designated 
for the purpose of this part.
    (c) The State or Indian tribe shall submit a voucher for

<R05>
Sec. 228.107  Eligible cost of activities.

    (a) If a cooperative agreement provides for Federal funding, only 
costs directly associated with eligible activities undertaken by the 
State or Indian tribe under the terms of a cooperative agreement will be 
eligible for reimbursement. Costs of services or activities which cannot 
be directly related to the support of activities specified in the 
agreement will not be eligible for Federal funding or for inclusion in 
the State's share or in the Indian tribe's share of funding that may be 
established in the agreement.
    (b) Eligible costs are the cost of salaries and benefits associated 
with technical, support, and clerical personnel engaged in eligible 
activities; direct cost of travel, rentals, and other normal 
administrative activities in direct support of the project or projects; 
basic and specialized training for State and tribal participants; and 
cost of any contractual services which can be shown to be in direct 
support of the activities covered by the agreement. Each cooperative 
agreement shall contain detailed schedules identifying those activities 
and costs which qualify for funding and the procedures, timing, and 
mechanics for implementing Federal funding.

    As provided at 30 U.S.C. 1736, 50 percent of any civil penalty 
collected as a result of activities under a cooperative agreement will 
be shared with the State or Indian tribe performing the cooperative 
agreement; however, the amount of the civil penalty shared will be 
deducted from any Federal funding owed under that cooperative agreement. 
MMS shall maintain records of civil penalties collected and distributed 
to the States and tribes involved in cooperative agreements. Each 
quarterly payment of the Federal share of a cooperative agreement will 
be reduced by the amount of the civil penalties paid to the State or 
tribe during the prior quarter.

<R05>
Sec. 229.120  Obtaining regulatory and policy guidance.

    All activities performed by a State under a delegation must be in 
full accord with all Federal laws, rules and regulations, and 
Secretarial and agency determinations and orders relating to the 
calculation, reporting, and payment of oil and gas royalties. In those 
cases when guidance or interpretations are necessary, the State will 
direct written requests for such guidance or interpretation to the 
appropriate MMS officials. All policy and procedural guidance or 
interpretation provided by the MMS shall be in writing and shall be 
binding on the State.


<R05>
Sec. 229.121  Recordkeeping requirements.

    (a) The State shall maintain in a safe and secure manner all 
records, workpapers, reports, and correspondence gained or developed as 
a consequence of audit or investigative activities conducted under the 
delegation. All such records shall be made available for review and 
inspection upon request by representatives of the Secretary and the 
Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG).
    (b) The State must maintain in a confidential manner all data 
obtained from DOI sources or from payor or company sources under the 
delegation which have been deemed ``confidential or proprietary'' by DOI 
or a company or payor. In this regard, the State regulatory authority 
shall be bound by provisions of 30 U.S.C. 1733. MMS shall provide to the 
State guidelines for determining confidential and proprietary material.
    (c) All records subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) must be 
maintained for a 6-year period measured from the end of the calendar 
year in which the records were created. All dispositions or records must 
be with the written approval of the MMS. Upon termination of a 
delegation, the State shall, within 90 days from the date of 
termination, assemble all records specified in subsection (a), complete 
all working paper files in accordance with Sec. 229.124, and transfer 
such records to the MMS.
    (d) The State shall maintain complete cost records for the 
delegation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Such records shall be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the total 
actual costs associated with the project and to permit a determination 
by MMS whether delegation funds were used for their intended purpose. 
All such records shall be made available for review and inspection upon 
request by representatives of the Secretary and the Department's Office 
of Inspector General (OGIG).


<R05>
Sec. 229.122  Coordination of audit activities.

    (a) Each State with a delegation of authority shall submit annually 
to the MMS an audit workplan specifically identifying leases, resources, 
companies, and payors scheduled for audit. This workplan must be 
submitted 120 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year. A State 
may request changes to its workplan (including the companies and leases 
to be audited) at the end of each quarter of each fiscal year. All 
requested changes are subject to approval by the MMS and must be 
submitted in writing.
    (b) When a State plans to audit leases of a lessee or royalty payor 
for which there is an MMS or OIG resident audit team, all audit 
activities must be coordinated through the MMS or OIG resident 
supervisor. Such activities include, but are not limited to, issuance of 
engagement letters, arranging for entrance conferences, submission of 
data requests, scheduling of audit activities including site visits, 
submission of issue letters, and closeout conferences.
    (c) The State shall consult with the MMS and/or OIG regarding 
resolution of any coordination problems encountered during the conduct 
of delegation activities.

[[Page 246]]


<R05>
Sec. 229.123  Standards for audit activities.

    (a) All audit activities performed under a delegation of authority 
must be in accordance with the ``Standards for Audit of Governmental 
Organizations, Programs, Activities, and Functions'' as issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States.
    (b) The following audit standards also shall apply to all audit work 
performed under a delegation of authority.
    (1) General standards--(i) Qualifications. The auditors assigned to 
perform the audit must collectively possess adequate professional 
proficiency for the tasks required, including a knowledge of accounting, 
auditing, agency regulations, and industry operations.
    (ii) Independence. In all matters relating to the audit work, the 
audit organization and the individual auditors must be free from 
personal or external impairments to independence and shall maintain an 
independent attitude and appearance.
    (iii) Due professional care. Due professional care is to be used in 
conducting the audit and in preparing related reports.
    (iv) Quality control. The State governments must institute quality 
control review procedures to ensure that all audits are performed in 
conformity with the standards established herein.
    (2) Examination and evaluation standards--Standards and requirements 
for examination and evaluation. Auditors should be alert to situations 
or transactions that could be indicative of fraud, abuse, or illegal 
acts with respect to the program. If such evidence exists, auditors 
should forward this evidence to MMS. The MMS will contact the 
appropriate Federal law enforcement agencies. The scope of examinations 
are to be governed by the principle of a justifiable relationship 
between cost and benefit as determined by the auditor or audit 
supervisor. Audit procedures should reflect the most efficient method of 
obtaining the requisite degree of satisfaction. The auditor should 
determine, to the extent possible, the effect on royalty reporting of 
the non-arms'-length nature of related party transactions, such as 
transfers of oil to refinery units affiliated with the producer. A 
review should be made of compliance with the appropriate laws and 
regulations applicable to program operations. MMS shall issue guidelines 
as to the definition and nature of arms'-length and non-arms'-length 
transactions for use in carrying out delegated audit activities.
    (3) Standards of reporting. (i) Written audit reports are to be 
submitted to the appropriate MMS officials at the end of each field 
examination.
    (ii) A statement in the auditors' report that the examination was 
made in accordance with the generally accepted program audit standards 
(including the applicable General Accounting Office (GAO) standards) for 
royalty compliance audits should be in the appropriate language to 
indicate that the audit was made in accordance with this statement of 
standards.
    (iii) The auditor's report should contain a statement of positive 
assurance on those items tested and negative assurance on those items 
not tested. It should also include all instances of noncompliance and 
instances or indications of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts found during 
or in connection with the audit.
    (iv) The auditor's report should contain any other material 
deficiency identified during the audit not covered in paragraph 
(b)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (v) When factors external to the program and to the auditor restrict 
the audit or interfere with the auditor's ability to form objective 
opinions and conclusions (such as denial of access to information by a 
company), the auditor is to notify the MMS. If the limitation is not 
removed, a description of the matter must be included in the auditor's 
report. MMS will take all legally enforceable steps necessary to seek 
information necessary to complete the audit.
    (vi) If certain information is prohibited from general disclosure, 
the auditor's report should state the nature of the information omitted 
and the requirement that makes the omission necessary.
    (vii) Written audit reports are to be prepared in the format 
prescribed by the MMS.

[[Page 247]]

    (viii) In instances where the extent of the audit findings or the 
amounts involved do not warrant it, a formal audit report need not be 
issued. In lieu of an audit report, a memorandum of audit findings will 
be prepared and placed on the case file.

<R05>
Sec. 229.124  Documentation standards.

    Every audit performed by a State under a delegation of authority 
must meet certain documentation standards. In particular, detailed 
workpapers must be developed and maintained.
    (a) Workpapers are defined to include all records obtained or 
created in performing an audit.
    (b) Each audit performed varies in scope and detail. As a result, 
the audit team must determine the best presentation of the workpapers 
for a particular audit. The following general standards of workpaper 
preparation are consistent with the goal of achieving proper 
documentation while maintaining sufficient flexibility.
    (1) All relevant information obtained orally must be promptly 
recorded in writing and incorporated in the workpapers.
    (2) Workpapers must be complete and accurate in order to provide 
support for findings and conclusions.
    (3) Workpapers should be clear and understandable without the need 
for supplementary oral explanations. The information they contain must 
be clear, complete, and concise, so that anyone using the workpapers 
will be able to readily determine their purpose, the nature and scope of 
the work done, and the conclusions drawn.
    (4) Workpapers must be legible and as neat as practicable. They must 
meet standards which allow their use as evidence in judicial and 
administrative proceedings.
    (5) The information contained in workpapers should be restricted to 
matters which are materially important and relevant to the objectives 
established for the assignment.
    (6) Workpapers must be in sufficient detail to permit a subsequent 
independent execution of each audit procedure, assuming the target 
company retains its accounting documentation.


<R05>
Sec. 229.125  Preparation and issuance of enforcement documents.

    (a) Determinations of additional royalties due resulting from audit 
activities conducted under a delegation of authority must be formally 
communicated by the State, to the companies or other payors by an issue 
letter prior to any enforcement action. The issue letter will serve to 
ensure that all audit findings are accurate and complete by obtaining 
advance comments from officials of the companies or payors audited. 
Issue letters must be prepared in a format specified by the MMS, and 
transmitted to the company or payor. The company or payor shall be given 
30 days from receipt of the letter to respond to the State on the 
findings contained in the letter.
    (b) After evaluating the company or payor's response to the issue 
letter, the State shall draft a demand letter which will be submitted 
with supporting workpaper files to the MMS for appropriate enforcement 
action. Any sustantive revisions to the demand letter will be discussed 
with the State prior to issuance of the letter. Copies of all 
enforcement action documents shall be provided to the State by MMS upon 
their issuance to the company or payor.


<R05>
Sec. 229.126  Appeals.

    (a) Appeals made pursuant to the rules and procedures at 30 CFR 
parts 243 and 290 related to demand letters issued by officers of the 
MMS for additional royalties identified under a delegation of authority 
shall be filed with the MMS for processing. The State regulatory 
authority shall, upon the request of the MMS, provide competent and 
knowledgeable staff for testimony, as well as any required documentation 
and analyses, in support of the lessor's position during the appeal 
process.
    (b) An affected State, upon the request of the MMS, shall provide 
expert witnesses from their audit staff for testimony as well as 
required documentation and analyses to support the Department's position 
during the litigation of court cases arising from denied appeals. The 
cost of providing expert witnesses including travel and per diem is 
reimbursable under the provisions of

[[Page 248]]

a delegation of authority, at the Federal Government's existing per diem 
rates.


<R05>
Sec. 229.127  Reports from States.

    The State, acting under the authority of the Secretarial delegation, 
shall submit quarterly reports which will summarize activities carried 
out by the State during the preceding quarter of the year under the 
provisions of the delegation. The report shall include:
    (a) A statistical summary of the activities carried out, e.g., 
number of audits performed, accounts reconciled, and other actions 
taken;
    (b) A summary of costs incurred during the previous quarter for 
which the State is seeking reimbursement; and
    (c) A schedule of changes which the State proposes to make from its 
approved plan.

under Sec. 241.73;
    (3) You received an IBLA decision under Sec. 241.73 if the IBLA 
continued the stay of accrual of penalties pending its decision and you

jurisdiction is entered, if you sought judicial review of the IBLA's

1719(k).
    (b) If the Department uses judicial process, or if you seek judicial 
review under Sec. 241.74 and the court upholds assessment of a penalty, 
the court shall have jurisdiction to award the amount assessed plus 
interest assessed from the date of the expiration of the 90-day period 
referred to in Sec. 241.74. The amount of any penalty, as finally

    (a) Federal leases.Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, if you 
appeal an order regarding the payment and reporting of royalties and 
other payments due from Federal mineral leases onshore or on the Outer 
Continental Shelf (OCS), and:
    (1) If the amount under appeal is less than $10,000 or does not 
require payment of a specified amount, MMS will suspend your obligation 
to comply with the order. MMS will use the lease surety posted with the 
Bureau of Land Management for onshore leases, and MMS for OCS leases, as 
collateral for the obligation; or
    (2) If the amount under appeal is $10,000 or more, MMS will suspend 
your obligation to comply with that order if you:
    (i) Submit an MMS-specified surety instrument under subpart B of 
this part within a time period MMS prescribes; or
    (ii) Demonstrate financial solvency under subpart C.
    (b) Indian leases.Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, if you 
appeal an order regarding the payment and reporting of royalties and 
other payments due from Indian mineral leases subject to this part, and:
    (1) If the amount under appeal is less than $1,000 or does not 
require payment, MMS will suspend your obligation to comply with the 
order. MMS will use the lease surety posted with the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs as collateral for the obligation; or
    (2) If the amount under appeal is $1,000 or more, MMS will suspend 
your obligation to comply with that order if you submit an MMS-specified 
surety instrument under subpart B of this part within a time period MMS 
prescribes.
    (c) Nothing in this part prohibits you from paying any demanded 
amount or complying with any other requirement pending appeal. However, 
voluntarily paying any demanded amount or otherwise complying with any 
other requirement when suspension of an order is otherwise available 
under these rules does not create judicially reviewable final agency 
action under 5 U.S.C. 704.
    (d) Regardless of the amount under appeal, MMS may inform you that 
it will not suspend your obligation to comply with the order under 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section because suspension would harm the 
interests of the United States or the Indian lessor.


<R05>
Sec. 243.9  Will MMS continue to suspend my obligation to comply with 
an order if I seek judicial review in a Federal court?

    (a) If you seek judicial review of an IBLA decision or other final 
action of the Department of the Interior regarding an order, MMS will 
suspend your obligation to comply with that order

[[Page 256]]

pending judicial review if you continue to meet the requirements of this 
part.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, 
MMS may decide that it will not suspend your obligation to comply with 
an order. MMS will notify you in writing of that decision and the 
reasons for it.


<R05>
Sec. 243.10  When will MMS collect against a bond or other surety 
instrument or a person demonstrating financial solvency?

    (a) This section applies to you if, for an appeal of an order under 
this part, you:
    (1) Maintain a bond or an MMS-specified surety instrument on your 
own behalf or for another person; or
    (2) Have demonstrated financial solvency on your own behalf or for 
another person.
    (b) MMS may initiate collection against the bond or other surety 
instrument or the person demonstrating financial solvency:
    (1) If the MMS Director or the Deputy Commissioner of Indian Affairs 
decides your appeal adversely to you and you do not pay the amount due 
or appeal that decision to the IBLA under 43 CFR part 4, subpart E;
    (2) If the IBLA, the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, 
an Assistant Secretary, or the Secretary decides your appeal adversely 
to you, and you do not pay the amount due or pursue judicial review 
within 90 days of the decision;
    (3) If a court of competent jurisdiction issues a final non-
appealable decision adverse to you, and you do not pay the amount due 
within 30 days of the decision;
    (4) If you do not increase the amount of your bond or other surety 
instrument as required under Sec. 243.101(b), or otherwise fail to 
maintain an adequate surety instrument in effect, and you do not pay the 
amount due under the order within 30 days of notice from MMS under Sec. 
243.101(b);
    (5) If the obligation to comply with an order or decision is not 
suspended under Sec. 243.8 or Sec.  243.9 and you do not pay the amount 
required under the order or decision; or
    (6) If the MMS bond-approving officer determines that you are no 
longer financially solvent under Sec. 243.202(c), and you do not pay 
the order amount or post a bond or other MMS-specified surety instrument 
under subpart B within 30 days of that determination.


<R05>
Sec. 243.11  May I appeal the MMS bond-approving officer's determination 
of my surety amount or financial solvency?

    Any decision on your surety amount under subpart B or your financial 
solvency under subpart C is final and is not subject to appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 243.12  May I substitute a demonstration of financial solvency for 
a bond posted before the effective date of this rule?

    If you appealed an order before June 14, 1999 and you submitted an 
MMS-specified surety instrument to suspend compliance with that order, 
you may replace the surety with a demonstration of financial solvency 
under this part at an administratively convenient time, such as when the 
surety instrument is due for renewal.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Bonding Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 243.100  What standards must my MMS-specified surety instrument 
meet?

    (a) An MMS-specified surety instrument must be in a form specified 
in MMS instructions. MMS will give you written information and standard 
forms for MMS-specified surety instrument requirements.
    (b) MMS will use a bank-rating service to determine whether a 
financial institution has an acceptable rating to provide a surety 
instrument adequate to indemnify the lessor from loss or damage.
    (1) Administrative appeal bonds must be issued by a qualified surety 
company which the Department of the Treasury has approved.
    (2) Irrevocable letters of credit or certificates of deposit must be 
from a financial institution acceptable to MMS with a minimum 1-year 
period of coverage subject to automatic renewal up to 5 years.

[[Page 257]]


<R05>
Sec. 243.101  How will MMS determine the amount of my bond or other 
surety instrument?

    (a) The MMS bond-approving officer may approve your surety if he or 
she determines that the amount is adequate to guarantee payment. The 
amount of your surety may vary depending on the form of the surety and 
how long the surety is effective.
    (1) The amount of the MMS-specified surety instrument must include 
the principal amount owed under the order plus any accrued interest we 
determine is owed plus projected interest for a 1-year period.
    (2) Treasury book-entry bond or note amounts must be equal to at 
least 120 percent of the required surety amount.
    (b) If your appeal is not decided within 1 year from the filing 
date, you must increase the surety amount to cover additional estimated 
interest for another 1-year period. You must continue to do this 
annually on the date your appeal was filed. We will determine the 
additional estimated interest and notify you of the amount so you can 
amend your surety instrument.
    (c) You may submit a single surety instrument that covers multiple 
appeals. You may change the instrument to add new amounts under appeal 
or remove amounts that have been adjudicated in your favor or that you 
have paid if you:
    (1) Amend the single surety instrument annually on the date you 
filed your first appeal; and
    (2) Submit a separate surety instrument for new amounts under appeal 
until you amend the instrument to cover the new appeals.


<R04>
                Subpart C_Financial Solvency Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 243.200  How do I demonstrate financial solvency?

    (a) To demonstrate financial solvency under this part, you must 
submit an audited consolidated balance sheet, and, if requested by the 
MMS bond-approving officer, up to 3 years of tax returns to the MMS, 
Debt Collection Section using:
    (1) The U.S. Postal Service or private delivery at P.O. Box 5760, MS 
3031, Denver, CO 80217-5760; or
    (2) Courier or overnight delivery at MS 3031, Denver Federal Center, 
Bldg. 85, Room A-212, Denver, CO 80225-0165.
    (b) You must submit an audited consolidated balance sheet annually, 
and, if requested, additional annual tax returns on the date MMS first 
determined that you demonstrated financial solvency as long as you have 
active appeals, or whenever MMS requests.
    (c) If you demonstrate financial solvency in the current calendar 
year, you are not required to redemonstrate financial solvency for new 
appeals of orders during that calendar year unless you file for 
protection under any provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of 
the United States Code), or MMS notifies you that you must redemonstrate 
financial solvency.


<R05>
Sec. 243.201  How will MMS determine if I am financially solvent?

    (a) The MMS bond-approving officer will determine your financial 
solvency by examining your total net worth, including, as appropriate, 
the net worth of your affiliated entities.
    (b) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety 
under subpart B for all orders you have appealed is greater than $300 
million, you are presumptively deemed financially solvent, and we will 
not require you to post a bond or other surety instrument.
    (c) If your net worth, minus the amount we would require as surety 
under subpart B for all orders you have appealed is less than $300 
million, you must submit the following to the MMS Debt Collection 
Section by one of the methods in Sec. 243.200(a):
    (1) A written request asking us to consult a business-information, 
or credit-reporting service or program to determine your financial 
solvency; and
    (2) A nonrefundable $50 processing fee:
    (i) You must pay the processing fee to us following the requirements 
for making payments found in 30 CFR 218.51. You are not required to use 
Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for these payments;
    (ii) You must submit the fee with your request under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, and then annually on the

[[Page 258]]

date we first determined that you demonstrated financial solvency, as 
long as you are not able to demonstrate financial solvency under 
paragraph (a) of this section and you have active appeals.
    (d) If you request that we consult a business-information or credit-
reporting service or program under paragraph (c) of this section:
    (1) We will use criteria similar to that which a potential creditor 
would use to lend an amount equal to the bond or other surety instrument 
we would require under subpart B;
    (2) For us to consider you financially solvent, the business-
information or credit-reporting service or program must demonstrate your 
degree of risk as low to moderate:
    (i) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-
information or credit-reporting service or program information 
demonstrates your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-
approving officer will not require you to post a bond or other surety 
instrument under subpart B;
    (ii) If our bond-approving officer determines that the business-
information or credit-reporting service or program information does not 
demonstrate your financial solvency to our satisfaction, our bond-
approving officer will require you to post a bond or other surety 
instrument under subpart B or pay the obligation.


<R05>
Sec. 243.202  When will MMS monitor my financial solvency?

    (a) If you are presumptively financially solvent under Sec. 
243.201(b), MMS will determine your net worth as described under 
Sec. Sec. 243.201(b) and (c) to evaluate your financial solvency at 
least annually on the date we first determined that you demonstrated 
financial solvency as long as you have active appeals and each time you 
appeal a new order.
    (b) If you ask us to consult a business-information or credit-
reporting service or program under Sec. 243.201(c), we will consult a 
service or program annually as long as you have active appeals and each 
time you appeal a new order.
    (c) If our bond-approving officer determines that you are no longer 
financially solvent, you must post a bond or other MMS-specified surety 
instrument under subpart B.

    The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) authorized the Minerals 
Management Service (MMS) to regulate oil, gas, and sulphur exploration, 
development, and production operations on the outer Continental Shelf 
(OCS). Under the Secretary's authority, the Director requires that all 
operations:
    (a) Be conducted according to the OCS Lands Act (OCSLA), the 
regulations in this part, MMS orders, the lease or right-of-way, and 
other applicable laws, regulations, and amendments; and
    (b) Conform to sound conservation practice to preserve, protect, and 
develop mineral resources of the OCS to:
    (1) Make resources available to meet the Nation's energy needs;
    (2) Balance orderly energy resource development with protection of 
the human, marine, and coastal environments;
    (3) Ensure the public receives a fair and equitable return on the 
resources of the OCS;
    (4) Preserve and maintain free enterprise competition; and
    (5) Minimize or eliminate conflicts between the exploration, 
development, and production of oil and natural gas and the recovery of 
other resources.

Sec. 250.113  What procedures must I follow when welding?

    (a) Before you weld, you must move any equipment containing 
hydrocarbons or other flammable substances at least 35 feet horizontally 
from the welding area. You must move similar equipment on lower decks at 
least 35 feet from the point of impact where slag, sparks, or other 
burning materials could fall. If moving this equipment is impractical, 
you must protect that equipment with flame-proofed covers, shield it 
with metal or fire-resistant guards or curtains, or render the flammable 
substances inert.
    (b) While you weld, you must monitor all water-discharge-point 
sources from hydrocarbon-handling vessels. If a discharge of flammable 
fluids occurs, you must stop welding.
    (c) If you cannot weld in one of the designated safe-welding areas 
that you listed in your safe welding plan, you must meet the following 
requirements:
    (1) You may not begin welding until:
    (i) The welding supervisor or designated person in charge advises in 
writing that it is safe to weld.

[[Page 275]]

    (ii) You and the designated person in charge inspect the work area 
and areas below it for potential fire and explosion hazards.
    (2) During welding, the person in charge must designate one or more 
persons as a fire watch. The fire watch must:
    (i) Have no other duties while actual welding is in progress;
    (ii) Have usable firefighting equipment;
    (iii) Remain on duty for 30 minutes after welding activities end; 
and
    (iv) Maintain a continuous surveillance with a portable gas detector 
during the welding and burning operation if welding occurs in an area 
not equipped with a gas detector.
    (3) You may not weld piping, containers, tanks, or other vessels 
that have contained a flammable substance unless you have rendered the 
contents inert and the designated person in charge has determined it is 
safe to weld. This does not apply to approved hot taps.
    (4) You may not weld within 10 feet of a wellbay unless you have 
shut in all producing wells in that wellbay.
    (5) You may not weld within 10 feet of a production area, unless you 
have shut in that production area.
    (6) You may not weld while you drill, complete, workover, or conduct 
wireline operations unless:
    (i) The fluids in the well (being drilled, completed, worked over, 
or having wireline operations conducted) are noncombustible; and
    (ii) You have precluded the entry of formation hydrocarbons into the 
wellbore by either mechanical means or a positive overbalance toward the 
formation.

  Naming and Identifying Facilities and Wells (Does Not Include MODUs)


<R05>
Sec. 250.150  How do I name facilities and wells in the Gulf of Mexico 
Region?

    (a) Assign each facility a letter designation except for those types 
of facilities identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For 
example, A, B, CA, or CB.
    (1) After a facility is installed, rename each predrilled well that 
was assigned only a number and was suspended temporarily at the mudline 
or at the surface. Use a letter and number designation. The letter used 
must be the same as that of the production facility, and the number used 
must correspond to the order in which the well was completed, not 
necessarily the number assigned when it was drilled. For example, the 
first well completed for production on Facility A would be renamed Well 
A-1, the second would be Well A-2, and so on; and
    (2) When you have more than one facility on a block, each facility 
installed, and not bridge-connected to another facility, must be named 
using a different letter in sequential order. For example, EC 222A, EC 
222B, EC 222C.
    (3) When you have more than one facility on multiple blocks in a 
local area being co-developed, each facility installed and not connected 
with a walkway to another facility should be named using a different 
letter in sequential order with the block number corresponding to the 
block on which the platform is located. For example, EC 221A, EC 222B 
and EC 223C.
    (b) In naming multiple well caissons, you must assign a letter 
designation.
    (c) In naming single well caissons, you must use certain criteria as 
follows:
    (1) For single well caissons not attached to a facility with a 
walkway, use the well designation. For example, Well No. 1;
    (2) For single well caissons attached to a facility with a walkway, 
use the same designation as the facility. For example, rename Well No.10 
as A-10; and
    (3) For single well caissons with production equipment, use a letter 
designation for the facility name and a letter plus number designation 
for the well. For example, the Well No. 1 caisson would be designated as 
Facility A, and the well would be Well A-1.


<R05>
Sec. 250.151  How do I name facilities in the Pacific Region?

    The operator assigns a name to the facility.


<R05>
Sec. 250.152  How do I name facilities in the Alaska Region?

    Facilities will be named and identified according to the Regional 
Director's directions.


<R05>

    (a) If your lease is in its primary term:
    (1) You must submit a report to the District Supervisor according to 
paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section whenever production begins 
initially, whenever production ceases during the last 180 days of the 
primary term, and whenever production resumes during the last 180 days 
of the primary term.
    (2) Your lease expires at the end of its primary term unless you are 
conducting operations on your lease (see 30 CFR part 256). For purposes 
of this section, the term operations means, drilling, well-reworking, or 
production in paying quantities. The objective of the drilling or well-
reworking must be to establish production in paying quantities on the 
lease.
    (b) If you stop conducting operations during the last 180 days of 
your primary lease term, your lease will expire unless you either resume 
operations or receive an SOO or an SOP from the Regional Supervisor 
under Sec. Sec. 250.172, 250.173, 250.174, or 250.175 before the end of 
the 180th day after you stop operations.
    (c) If you extend your lease term under paragraph (b) of this 
section, you must pay rental or minimum royalty, as appropriate, for 
each year or part of the year during which your lease continues in force 
beyond the end of the primary lease term.

of the 180th day after you stop operations.
    (e) You may ask the Regional Supervisor to allow you more than 180 
days to resume operations on a lease continued beyond its primary term 
when operating conditions warrant. The request must be in writing and 
explain the operating conditions that warrant a longer period. In 
allowing additional time, the Regional Supervisor must determine that 
the longer period is in the national interest, and it conserves 
resources, prevents waste, or protects correlative rights.
    (f) When you begin conducting operations on a lease that has 
continued beyond its primary term, you must immediately notify the 
District Supervisor either orally or by fax or e-mail and follow up with 
a written report according to paragraph (g) of this section.
    (g) If your lease is continued beyond its primary term, you must 
submit a report to the District Supervisor under paragraphs (h) and (i) 
of this section whenever production begins initially, whenever 
production ceases, whenever production resumes before the end of the 
180-day period after having ceased, or whenever drilling or well-
reworking operations begin before the end of the 180-day period.
    (h) The reports required by paragraphs (a) and (g) of this section 
must contain:
    (1) Name of lessee or operator;
    (2) The well number, lease number, area, and block;

    (1) Initialization of production--within 5 days of initial 
production.
    (2) Cessation of production--within 15 days after the first full 
month of zero production.
    (3) Resumption of production--within 5 days of resuming production 
after ceasing production under paragraph (i)(2) of this section.
    (4) Drilling or well reworking operations--within 5 days of 
beginning and completing the leaseholding operations.
    (j) For leases continued beyond the primary term, you must 
immediately report to the District Supervisor if operations do not begin 
before the end of the 180-day period.

<R05>
Sec. 250.185  When is there no compensation for a lease cancellation?

    You will not receive compensation from MMS for lease cancellation 
if:

Secretary of Commerce does not make the finding authorized by section 
307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA;

    You must submit evacuation statistics to the Regional Supervisor for 
a natural occurrence such as an earthquake or hurricane. MMS will notify 
local and national authorities and the public, as appropriate. 
Statistics include facilities and rigs evacuated and amount of 
production shut-in for gas and oil. You must:
    (a) Submit the statistics by fax or e-mail as soon as possible when

Sec. 250.194  How must I protect archaeological resources?

    (a) If the Regional Director has reason to believe that an 
archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, the Regional 
Director will require in writing that your EP, DOCD, or DPP be 
accompanied by an archaeological report. If the archaeological report

[[Page 291]]

suggests that an archaeological resource may be present, you must 
either:
    (1) Locate the site of any operation so as not to adversely affect 
the area where the archaeological resource may be; or
    (2) Establish to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that an 
archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely affected 
by operations. This requires further archaeological investigation, 
conducted by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using survey equipment 
and techniques the Regional Director considers appropriate. You must 
submit the investigation report to the Regional Director for review.
    (b) If the Regional Director determines that an archaeological 
resource is likely to be present in the lease area and may be adversely 
affected by operations, the Regional Director will notify you 
immediately. You must not take any action that may adversely affect the 
archaeological resource until the Regional Director has told you how to 
protect the resource.
    (c) If you discover any archaeological resource while conducting 
operations in the lease area, you must immediately halt operations 
within the area of the discovery and report the discovery to the 
Regional Director. If investigations determine that the resource is 
significant, the Regional Director will tell you how to protect it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


<R05>
Sec. 250.271  For what reasons will MMS disapprove the DPP or DOCD?

    The Regional Supervisor will disapprove your proposed DPP or DOCD if 
one of the four reasons in this section applies:
    (a) Non-compliance. The Regional Supervisor determines that you have 
failed to demonstrate that you can comply with the requirements of the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (Act), implementing 
regulations, or other applicable Federal laws.
    (b) No consistency concurrence. (1) An affected State has not yet 
issued a final decision on your coastal zone consistency certification 
(see 15 CFR 930.78(a)); or
    (2) An affected State objects to your coastal zone consistency 
certification, and the Secretary of Commerce, under section 
307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)), has not 
found that each activity described in the DPP or DOCD is consistent with 
the objectives of the CZMA or is otherwise necessary in the interest of 
national security.
    (3) If the Regional Supervisor disapproved your DPP or DOCD for the 
sole reason that an affected State either has not yet issued a final 
decision on, or has objected to, your coastal zone consistency 
certification (see paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) in this section), the 
Regional Supervisor will approve your DPP or DOCD upon receipt of 
concurrence by the affected State, at the time concurrence of the 
affected State is conclusively presumed, or when the Secretary of 
Commerce makes a finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the 
CZMA (16 U.S.C. 1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in your 
DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA, or is 
otherwise necessary in the interest of national security. In that event, 
you do not need to resubmit your DPP or DOCD for approval under Sec. 
250.273(b).
    (c) National security or defense conflicts. Your proposed activities 
would threaten national security or defense.
    (d) Exceptional circumstances. The Regional Supervisor determines 
because of exceptional geological conditions, exceptional resource 
values in the marine or coastal environment, or other exceptional 
circumstances that all of the following apply:
    (1) Implementing your DPP or DOCD would cause serious harm or damage 
to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral 
deposits (in areas leased or not leased), the national security or 
defense, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
    (2) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
    (3) The advantages of disapproving your DPP or DOCD outweigh the 
advantages of development and production.


<R05>
Sec. 250.272  If a State objects to the DPP's or DOCD's coastal zone 
consistency certification, what can I do?

    If an affected State objects to the coastal zone consistency 
certification accompanying your proposed or disapproved DPP or DOCD, you 
may do one of the following:
    (a) Amend or resubmit your DPP or DOCD. Amend or resubmit your DPP 
or DOCD to accommodate the State's objection and submit the amendment or 
resubmittal to the Regional Supervisor for approval. The amendment or 
resubmittal needs to only address information related to the State's 
objections.
    (b) Appeal. Appeal the State's objection to the Secretary of 
Commerce using the procedures in 15 CFR part

[[Page 324]]

930, subpart H. The Secretary of Commerce will either:
    (1) Grant your appeal by finding under section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of 
the CZMA (16 U.S.C.1456(c)(3)(B)(iii)) that each activity described in 
detail in your DPP or DOCD is consistent with the objectives of the 
CZMA, or is otherwise necessary in the interest of national security; or
    (2) Deny your appeal, in which case you may amend or resubmit your 
DPP or DOCD, as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Withdraw your DPP or DOCD. Withdraw your DPP or DOCD if you 
decide not to conduct your proposed development and production 
activities.


<R05>
Sec. 250.273  How do I submit a modified DPP or DOCD or resubmit a 
disapproved DPP or DOCD?

    (a) Modified DPP or DOCD. If the Regional Supervisor requires you to 
modify your proposed DPP or DOCD under Sec. 250.270(b)(2), you must 
submit the modification(s) to the Regional Supervisor in the same manner 
as for a new DPP or DOCD. You need submit only information related to 
the proposed modification(s).
    (b) Resubmitted DPP or DOCD. If the Regional Supervisor disapproves 
your DPP or DOCD under Sec. 250.270(b)(3), and except as provided in 
Sec. 250.271(b)(3), you may resubmit the disapproved DPP or DOCD if 
there is a change in the conditions that were the basis of its 
disapproval.
    (c) MMS review and timeframe. The Regional Supervisor will use the 
performance standards in Sec. 250.202 to either approve, require you to 
further modify, or disapprove your modified or resubmitted DPP or DOCD. 
The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 60 calendar days 
after the Regional Supervisor deems your modified or resubmitted DPP or 
DOCD to be submitted, or receives the last amendment to your modified or 
resubmitted DPP or DOCD, whichever occurs later.

          Post-Approval Requirements for the EP, DPP, and DOCD


<R05>
Sec. 250.280  How must I conduct activities under the approved EP, DPP, 
or DOCD?

    (a) Compliance. You must conduct all of your lease and unit 
activities according to your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD and any approval 
conditions. If you fail to comply with your approved EP, DPP, or DOCD:

DOCDs?

    (a) Submittal. You must submit to the Regional Supervisor any 
revisions and supplements to approved EPs, DPPs, or DOCDs for approval, 
whether you initiate them or the Regional Supervisor orders them.
    (b) Information. Revised and supplemental EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs need 
include only information related to or affected by the proposed changes, 
including information on changes in expected environmental impacts.
    (c) Procedures. All supplemental EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs, and those 
revised EPs, DPPs, and DOCDs that the Regional Supervisor determines are 
likely to result in a significant change in the impacts previously 
identified and evaluated, are subject to all of the procedures under 
Sec. 250.231 through Sec.  250.235 for EPs and Sec.  250.266 through 
Sec. 250.274 for DPPs and DOCDs.

                    Deepwater Operations Plans (DWOP)


<R05>
Sec. 250.286  What is a DWOP?

    (a) A DWOP is a plan that provides sufficient information for MMS to 
review a deepwater development project, and any other project that uses 
non-conventional production or completion technology, from a total 
system approach. The DWOP does not replace, but supplements other 
submittals required by the regulations such as Exploration Plans, 
Development and Production Plans, and Development Operations 
Coordination Documents. MMS will use the information in your DWOP to 
determine whether the project will be developed in an acceptable manner, 
particularly with respect to operational safety and environmental 
protection issues involved with non-conventional production or 
completion technology.
    (b) The DWOP process consists of two parts: a Conceptual Plan and 
the DWOP. Section 250.289 prescribes what the Conceptual Plan must 
contain, and Sec. 250.292 prescribes what the DWOP must contain.


<R05>
Sec. 250.287  For what development projects must I submit a DWOP?

    You must submit a DWOP for each development project in which you 
will use non-conventional production or completion technology, 
regardless of water depth. If you are unsure whether MMS considers the 
technology of your project non-conventional, you must contact the 
Regional Supervisor for guidance.


<R05>
Sec. 250.288  When and how must I submit the Conceptual Plan?

    You must submit four copies, or one hard copy and one electronic 
version, of the Conceptual Plan to the Regional Director after you have 
decided on the general concept(s) for development and before you begin 
engineering design of the well safety control system or subsea 
production systems to be used after well completion.


<R05>
Sec. 250.289  What must the Conceptual Plan contain?

    In the Conceptual Plan, you must explain the general design basis 
and philosophy that you will use to develop the field. You must include 
the following information:
    (a) An overview of the development concept(s);
    (b) A well location plat;
    (c) The system control type (i.e., direct hydraulic or electro-
hydraulic); and

[[Page 327]]

    (d) The distance from each of the wells to the host platform.


<R05>
Sec. 250.290  What operations require approval of the Conceptual Plan?

    You may not complete any production well or install the subsea 
wellhead and well safety control system (often called the tree) before 
MMS has approved the Conceptual Plan.


<R05>
Sec. 250.291  When and how must I submit the DWOP?

    You must submit four copies, or one hard copy and one electronic 
version, of the DWOP to the Regional Director after you have 
substantially completed safety system design and before you begin to 
procure or fabricate the safety and operational systems (other than the 
tree), production platforms, pipelines, or other parts of the production 
system.


<R05>
Sec. 250.292  What must the DWOP contain?

    You must include the following information in your DWOP:
    (a) A description and schematic of the typical wellbore, casing, and 
completion;
    (b) Structural design, fabrication, and installation information for 
each surface system, including host facilities;
    (c) Design, fabrication, and installation information on the mooring 
systems for each surface system;
    (d) Information on any active stationkeeping system(s) involving 
thrusters or other means of propulsion used with a surface system;
    (e) Information concerning the drilling and completion systems;
    (f) Design and fabrication information for each riser system (e.g., 
drilling, workover, production, and injection);
    (g) Pipeline information;
    (h) Information about the design, fabrication, and operation of an 
offtake system for transferring produced hydrocarbons to a transport 
vessel;
    (i) Information about subsea wells and associated systems that 
constitute all or part of a single project development covered by the 
DWOP;
    (j) Flow schematics and Safety Analysis Function Evaluation (SAFE) 
charts (API RP 14C, subsection 4.3c, incorporated by reference in Sec. 
250.198) of the production system from the Surface Controlled Subsurface 
Safety Valve (SCSSV) downstream to the first item of separation 
equipment;
    (k) A description of the surface/subsea safety system and emergency 
support systems to include a table that depicts what valves will close, 
at what times, and for what events or reasons;
    (l) A general description of the operating procedures, including a 
table summarizing the curtailment of production and offloading based on 
operational considerations;
    (m) A description of the facility installation and commissioning 
procedure;
    (n) A discussion of any new technology that affects hydrocarbon 
recovery systems; and
    (o) A list of any alternate compliance procedures or departures for 
which you anticipate requesting approval.


<R05>
Sec. 250.293  What operations require approval of the DWOP?

    You may not begin production until MMS approves your DWOP.


<R05>
Sec. 250.294  May I combine the Conceptual Plan and the DWOP?

    If your development project meets the following criteria, you may 
submit a combined Conceptual Plan/DWOP on or before the deadline for 
submitting the Conceptual Plan.
    (a) The project is located in water depths of less than 400 meters 
(1,312 feet); and
    (b) The project is similar to projects involving non-conventional 
production or completion technology for which you have obtained approval 
previously.


<R05>
Sec. 250.295  When must I revise my DWOP?

    You must revise either the Conceptual Plan or your DWOP to reflect 
changes in your development project that materially alter the 
facilities, equipment, and systems described in your plan. You must 
submit the revision within 60 days after any material change to the 
information required for that part of your plan.

[[Page 328]]

                Conservation Information Documents (CID)


<R05>
Sec. 250.296  When and how must I submit a CID or a revision to a CID?

    (a) You must submit one original and two copies of a CID to the 
appropriate OCS Region at the same time you first submit your DOCD or 
DPP for any development of a lease or leases located in water depths 
greater than 400 meters (1,312 feet). You must also submit a CID for a 
Supplemental DOCD or DPP when requested by the Regional Supervisor.
    (b) If you decide not to develop a reservoir you committed to 
develop in your CID, you must submit one original and two copies of a 
revision to the CID to the appropriate OCS Region. The revision to the 
CID must be submitted within 14 calendar days after making your decision 
not to develop the reservoir and before the reservoir is bypassed. The 
Regional Supervisor will approve or disapprove any such revision to the 
original CID. If the Regional Supervisor disapproves the revision, you 
must develop the reservoir as described in the original CID.


<R05>
Sec. 250.297  What information must a CID contain?

    (a) You must base the CID on wells drilled before your CID 
submittal, that define the extent of the reservoirs. You must notify MMS 
of any well that is drilled to total depth during the CID evaluation 
period and you may be required to update your CID.
    (b) You must include all of the following information if available. 
Information must be provided for each hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir that 
is penetrated by a well that would meet the producibility requirements 
of Sec. 250.115 or Sec.  250.116:
    (1) General discussion of the overall development of the reservoir;
    (2) Summary spreadsheets of well log data and reservoir parameters 
(i.e., sand tops and bases, fluid contacts, net pay, porosity, water 
saturations, pressures, formation volume factor);
    (3) Appropriate well logs, including digital well log (i.e., gamma 
ray, resistivity, neutron, density, sonic, caliper curves) curves in an

each well within the reservoir identified at the penetration point, 
along with the well name, labeled contours, and scale;
    (8) Estimates of original oil and gas in-place and anticipated 
recoverable oil and gas reserves, all reservoir parameters, and risk 
factors and assumptions;
    (9) Plat map at the same scale as the structure maps with existing 
and proposed well paths, as well as existing and proposed penetrations;
    (10) Wellbore schematics indicating proposed perforations;
    (11) Proposed wellbore utility chart showing all existing and 
proposed wells, with proposed completion intervals indicated for each 
borehole;
    (12) Appropriate pressure data, specified by date, and whether 
estimated or measured;
    (13) Description of reservoir development strategies;
    (14) Description of the enhanced recovery practices you will use or,

[[Page 329]]

    (16) Any other appropriate data you used in performing your 
reservoir evaluations and preparing your reservoir development 
strategies.


<R05>
Sec. 250.298  How long will MMS take to evaluate and make a decision 
on the CID?

    (a) The Regional Supervisor will make a decision within 150 calendar 
days of receiving your CID. If MMS does not act within 150 calendar 
days, your CID is considered approved.
    (b) MMS may suspend the 150-calendar-day evaluation period if there 
is missing, inconclusive, or inaccurate data, or when a well reaches 
total depth during the evaluation period. MMS may also suspend the 
evaluation period when a well penetrating a hydrocarbon-bearing 
structure reaches total depth during the evaluation period and the data 
from that well is needed for the CID. You will receive written 
notification from the Regional Supervisor describing the additional 
information that is needed, and the evaluation period will resume once 
MMS receives the requested information.
    (c) The Regional Supervisor will approve or deny your CID request 
based on your commitment to develop economically producible reservoirs 
according to sound conservation, engineering, and economic practices.


<R05>
Sec. 250.299  What operations require approval of the CID?

    You may not begin production before you receive MMS approval of the 
CID.


<R04>
               Subpart C_Pollution Prevention and Control


<R05>
Sec. 250.300  Pollution prevention.

    (a) During the exploration, development, production, and 
transportation of oil and gas or sulphur, the lessee shall take measures 
to prevent unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the offshore 
waters. The lessee shall not create conditions that will pose 
unreasonable risk to public health, life, property, aquatic life, 
wildlife, recreation, navigation, commercial fishing, or other uses of 
the ocean.
    (1) When pollution occurs as a result of operations conducted by or 
on behalf of the lessee and the pollution damages or threatens to damage 
life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral 
deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or 
human environment, the control and removal of the pollution to the 
satisfaction of the District Supervisor shall be at the expense of the 
lessee. Immediate corrective action shall be taken in all cases where 
pollution has occurred. Corrective action shall be subject to 
modification when directed by the District Supervisor.
    (2) If the lessee fails to control and remove the pollution, the 
Director, in cooperation with other appropriate Agencies of Federal, 
State, and local governments, or in cooperation with the lessee, or 
both, shall have the right to control and remove the pollution at the 
lessee's expense. Such action shall not relieve the lessee of any 
responsibility provided for by law.
    (b)(1) The District Supervisor may restrict the rate of drilling 
fluid discharges or prescribe alternative discharge methods. The 
District Supervisor may also restrict the use of components which could 
cause unreasonable degradation to the marine environment. No petroleum-
based substances, including diesel fuel, may be added to the drilling 
mud system without prior approval of the District Supervisor.
    (2) Approval of the method of disposal of drill cuttings, sand, and 
other well solids shall be obtained from the District Supervisor.
    (3) All hydrocarbon-handling equipment for testing and production 
such as separators, tanks, and treaters shall be designed, installed, 
and operated to prevent pollution. Maintenance or repairs which are 
necessary to prevent pollution of offshore waters shall be undertaken 
immediately.
    (4) Curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains shall be installed in deck 
areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants not authorized 
for discharge. Oil drainage shall be piped to a properly designed, 
operated, and maintained sump system which will automatically maintain 
the oil at a level sufficient to prevent discharge of oil into offshore 
waters. All gravity drains shall be equipped with a water trap or

[[Page 330]]

other means to prevent gas in the sump system from escaping through the 
drains. Sump piles shall not be used as processing devices to treat or 
skim liquids but may be used to collect treated-produced water, treated-
produced sand, or liquids from drip pans and deck drains and as a final 
trap for hydrocarbon liquids in the event of equipment upsets. 
Improperly designed, operated, or maintained sump piles which do not 
prevent the discharge of oil into offshore waters shall be replaced or 
repaired.
    (5) On artificial islands, all vessels containing hydrocarbons shall 
be placed inside an impervious berm or otherwise protected to contain 
spills. Drainage shall be directed away from the drilling rig to a sump. 
Drains and sumps shall be constructed to prevent seepage.
    (6) Disposal of equipment, cables, chains, containers, or other 
materials into offshore waters is prohibited.
    (c) Materials, equipment, tools, containers, and other items used in 
the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which are of such shape or 
configuration that they are likely to snag or damage fishing devices 
shall be handled and marked as follows:
    (1) All loose material, small tools, and other small objects shall 
be kept in a suitable storage area or a marked container when not in use 
and in a marked container before transport over offshore waters;
    (2) All cable, chain, or wire segments shall be recovered after use 
and securely stored until suitable disposal is accomplished;
    (3) Skid-mounted equipment, portable containers, spools or reels, 
and drums shall be marked with the owner's name prior to use or 
transport over offshore waters; and
    (4) All markings must clearly identify the owner and must be durable 
enough to resist the effects of the environmental conditions to which 
they may be exposed.
    (d) Any of the items described in paragraph (c) of this section that 
are lost overboard shall be recorded on the facility's daily operations 
report, as appropriate, and reported to the District Supervisor.

Sec. 250.302  Definitions concerning air quality.

    For purposes of Sec. Sec. 250.303 and 250.304 of this part:
    Air pollutant means any combination of agents for which the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established, pursuant to 
section 109 of the Clean Air Act, national primary or secondary ambient 
air quality standards.
    Attainment area means, for any air pollutant, an area which is shown 
by monitored data or which is calculated by air quality modeling (or 
other methods determined by the Administrator of EPA to be reliable) not 
to exceed any primary or secondary ambient air quality standards 
established by EPA.
    Best available control technology (BACT) means an emission 
limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction for each air 
pollutant subject to regulation, taking into account energy, 
environmental and economic impacts, and other costs. The BACT shall be 
verified on a case-by-case basis by the Regional Supervisor and may 
include reductions achieved through the application of processes, 
systems, and techniques for the control of each air pollutant.
    Emission offsets means emission reductions obtained from facilities, 
either onshore or offshore, other than the facility or facilities 
covered by the proposed Exploration Plan or Development and Production 
Plan.

[[Page 331]]

    Existing facility is an OCS facility described in an Exploration 
Plan or a Development and Production Plan submitted or approved prior to 
June 2, 1980.
    Facility means any installation or device permanently or temporarily 
attached to the seabed which is used for exploration, development, and 
production activities for oil, gas, or sulphur and which emits or has 
the potential to emit any air pollutant from one or more sources. All 
equipment directly associated with the installation or device shall be 
considered part of a single facility if the equipment is dependent on, 
or affects the processes of, the installation or device. During 
production, multiple installations or devices will be considered to be a 
single facility if the installations or devices are directly related to 
the production of oil, gas, or sulphur at a single site. Any vessel used 
to transfer production from an offshore facility shall be considered 
part of the facility while physically attached to it.
    Nonattainment area means, for any air pollutant, an area which is 
shown by monitored data or which is calculated by air quality modeling 
(or other methods determined by the Administrator of EPA to be reliable) 
to exceed any primary or secondary ambient air quality standard 
established by EPA.
    Projected emissions means emissions, either controlled or 
uncontrolled, from a source(s).
    Source means an emission point. Several sources may be included 
within a single facility.
    Temporary facility means activities associated with the construction 
of platforms offshore or with facilities related to exploration for or 
development of offshore oil and gas resources which are conducted in one 
location for less than 3 years.
    Volatile organic compound (VOC) means any organic compound which is 
emitted to the atmosphere as a vapor. The unreactive compounds are 
exempt from the above definition.

Sec. 250.303  Facilities described in a new or revised Exploration Plan 
or Development and Production Plan.

    (a) New plans. All Exploration Plans and Development and Production 
Plans shall include the information required to make the necessary 
findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section, and the 
lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section as necessary.
    (b) Applicability of Sec. 250.303 to existing facilities. (1) The 
Regional Supervisor may review any Exploration Plan or Development and 
Production Plan to determine whether any facility described in the plan 
should be subject to review under this section and has the potential to 
significantly affect the air quality of an onshore area. To make these 
decisions, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the distance of the 
facility from shore, the size of the facility, the number of sources 
planned for the facility and their operational status, and the air 
quality status of the onshore area.
    (2) For a facility identified by the Regional Supervisor in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Regional Supervisor shall require 
the lessee to refer to the information required in Sec. 250.218 or 
Sec. 250.249 of this part and to submit only that information required 
to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this 
section. The lessee shall submit this information within 120 days of the 
Regional Supervisor's determination or within a longer period of time at 
the discretion of the Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with 
the requirements of this section as necessary.
    (c) Revised facilities. All revised Exploration Plans and 
Development and Production Plans shall include the information required 
to make the necessary findings under paragraphs (d) through (i) of this 
section. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of this section 
as necessary.
    (d) Exemption formulas. To determine whether a facility described in 
a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or Development and 
Production Plan is exempt from further air quality review, the lessee 
shall use the highest annual-total amount of emissions from the facility 
for each air pollutant calculated

[[Page 332]]

in Sec. 250.249(a) or Sec.  250.218(a) of this part and compare these 
emissions to the emission exemption amount ``E'' for each air pollutant 
calculated using the following formulas: E=3400D<SUP>2/3</SUP> for 
carbon monoxide (CO); and E=33.3D for total suspended particulates 
(TSP), sulphur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>), nitrogen oxides 
(NO<INF>X</INF>), and VOC (where E is the emission exemption amount 
expressed in tons per year, and D is the distance of the proposed 
facility from the closest onshore area of a State expressed in statute 
miles). If the amount of these projected emissions is less than or equal 
to the emission exemption amount ``E'' for the air pollutant, the 
facility is exempt from further air quality review required under 
paragraphs (e) through (i) of this section.
    (e) Significance levels. For a facility not exempt under paragraph 
(d) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall 
use an approved air quality model to determine whether the projected 
emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore 
ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:

    Significance Levels: Air pollutant concentrations ([micro]g/m\3\)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (f) Significance determinations. (1) The projected emissions of any 
air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which result in an 
onshore ambient air concentration above the significance level 
determined under paragraph (e) of this section for that air pollutant, 
shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area for that air pollutant.
    (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not 
exempt under paragraph (d) of this section for that air pollutant shall 
be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area 
for VOC.
    (g) Controls required. (1) The projected emissions of any air 
pollutant other than VOC from any facility, except a temporary facility, 
which significantly affect the quality of a nonattainment area, shall be 
fully reduced. This shall be done through the application of BACT and, 
if additional reductions are necessary, through the application of 
additional emission controls or through the acquisition of offshore or 
onshore offsets.
    (2) The projected emissions of any air pollutant other than VOC from 
any facility which significantly affect the air quality of an attainment 
or unclassifiable area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (i) Except for temporary facilities, the lessee also shall use an 
approved air quality model to determine whether the emissions of TSP or 
SO<INF>2</INF> that remain after the application of BACT cause the 
following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentrations 
established in 40 CFR 52.21 to be exceeded in the attainment or 
unclassifiable area:

No concentration of an air pollutant shall exceed the concentration 
permitted under the national secondary ambient air quality standard or 
the concentration permitted under the national primary air quality 
standard, whichever concentration is lowest for the air pollutant for 
the period of exposure. For any period other than the annual period, the 
applicable maximum allowable increase may be exceeded during one such 
period per year at any one onshore location.
    (ii) If the maximum allowable increases are exceeded, the lessee 
shall apply whatever additional emission controls are necessary to 
reduce or offset the remaining emissions of TSP or

[[Page 333]]

SO<INF>2</INF> so that concentrations in the onshore ambient air of an 
attainment or unclassifiable area do not exceed the maximum allowable 
increases.
    (3)(i) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility, except a 
temporary facility, which significantly affect the onshore air quality 
of a nonattainment area shall be fully reduced. This shall be done 
through the application of BACT and, if additional reductions are 
necessary, through the application of additional emission controls or 
through the acquisition of offshore or onshore offsets.
    (ii) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which 
significantly affect the onshore air quality of an attainment area shall 
be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (4)(i) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect 
the onshore air quality of both a nonattainment and an attainment or 
unclassifiable area, the regulatory requirements applicable to projected 
emissions significantly affecting a nonattainment area shall apply.
    (ii) If projected emissions from a facility significantly affect the 
onshore air quality of more than one class of attainment area, the 
lessee must reduce projected emissions to meet the maximum allowable 
increases specified for each class in paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this 
section.
    (h) Controls required on temporary facilities. The lessee shall 
apply BACT to reduce projected emissions of any air pollutant from a 
temporary facility which significantly affect the air quality of an 
onshore area of a State.
    (i) Emission offsets. When emission offsets are to be obtained, the 
lessee must demonstrate that the offsets are equivalent in nature and 
quantity to the projected emissions that must be reduced after the 
application of BACT; a binding commitment exists between the lessee and 
the owner or owners of the source or sources; the appropriate air 
quality control jurisdiction has been notified of the need to revise the 
State Implementation Plan to include the information regarding the 
offsets; and the required offsets come from sources which affect the air 
quality of the area significantly affected by the lessee's offshore 
operations.
    (j) Review of facilities with emissions below the exemption amount. 
If, during the review of a new, modified, or revised Exploration Plan or 
Development and Production Plan, the Regional Supervisor determines or 
an affected State submits information to the Regional Supervisor which 
demonstrates, in the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected 
emissions from an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or 
in combination with other facilities in the area, significantly affect 
the air quality of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall 
require the lessee to submit additional information to determine whether 
emission control measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the 
opportunity to present information to the Regional Supervisor which 
demonstrates that the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the 
air quality of an onshore area of the State.
    (k) Emission monitoring requirements. The lessee shall monitor, in a 
manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from 
the facility. The lessee shall submit this information monthly in a 
manner and form approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
    (l) Collection of meteorological data. The Regional Supervisor may 
require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner 
approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit 
meteorological data from a facility.

Sec. 250.304  Existing facilities.

    (a) Process leading to review of an existing facility. (1) An 
affected State may request that the Regional Supervisor supply basic 
emission data from existing facilities when such data are needed for the 
updating of the State's emission inventory. In submitting the request, 
the State must demonstrate that similar offshore and onshore facilities 
in areas under the State's jurisdiction are also included in the 
emission inventory.
    (2) The Regional Supervisor may require lessees of existing 
facilities to

[[Page 334]]

submit basic emission data to a State submitting a request under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) The State submitting a request under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section may submit information from its emission inventory which 
indicates that emissions from existing facilities may be significantly 
affecting the air quality of the onshore area of the State. The lessee 
shall be given the opportunity to present information to the Regional 
Supervisor which demonstrates that the facility is not significantly 
affecting the air quality of the State.
    (4) The Regional Supervisor shall evaluate the information submitted 
under paragraph (a)(3) of this section and shall determine, based on the 
basic emission data, available meteorological data, and the distance of 
the facility or facilities from the onshore area, whether any existing 
facility has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of 
the onshore area of the State.
    (5) If the Regional Supervisor determines that no existing facility 
has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the State of and explain 
the reasons for this finding.
    (6) If the Regional Supervisor determines that an existing facility 
has the potential to significantly affect the air quality of an onshore 
area of the State submitting information under paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, the Regional Supervisor shall require the lessee to refer to 
the information requirements under Sec. 250.218 or 250.249 of this part 
and submit only that information required to make the necessary findings 
under paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. The lessee shall 
submit this information within 120 days of the Regional Supervisor's 
determination or within a longer period of time at the discretion of the 
Regional Supervisor. The lessee shall comply with the requirements of 
this section as necessary.
    (b) Exemption formulas. To determine whether an existing facility is 
exempt from further air quality review, the lessee shall use the highest 
annual total amount of emissions from the facility for each air 
pollutant calculated in Sec. 250.218(a) or 250.249(a) of this part and 
compare these emissions to the emission exemption amount ``E'' for each 
air pollutant calculated using the following formulas: 
E=3400D<SUP>2/3</SUP> for CO; and E=33.3D for TSP, SO<INF>2</INF>, 
NO<INF>X</INF>, and VOC (where E is the emission exemption amount 
expressed in tons per year, and D is the distance of the facility from 
the closest onshore area of the State expressed in statute miles). If 
the amount of projected emissions is less than or equal to the emission 
exemption amount ``E'' for the air pollutant, the facility is exempt for 
that air pollutant from further air quality review required under 
paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
    (c) Significance levels. For a facility not exempt under paragraph 
(b) of this section for air pollutants other than VOC, the lessee shall 
use an approved air quality model to determine whether projected 
emissions of those air pollutants from the facility result in an onshore 
ambient air concentration above the following significance levels:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Significance determinations. (1) The projected emissions of any 
air pollutant other than VOC from any facility which result in an 
onshore ambient air concentration above the significance levels 
determined under paragraph (c) of this section for that air pollutant 
shall be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore 
area for that air pollutant.
    (2) The projected emissions of VOC from any facility which is not 
exempt under paragraph (b) of this section for that air pollutant shall 
be deemed to significantly affect the air quality of the onshore area 
for VOC.
    (e) Controls required. (1) The projected emissions of any air 
pollutant which significantly affect the air quality of

[[Page 335]]

an onshore area shall be reduced through the application of BACT.
    (2) The lessee shall submit a compliance schedule for the 
application of BACT. If it is necessary to cease operations to allow for 
the installation of emission controls, the lessee may apply for a 
suspension of operations under the provisions of Sec. 250.174 of this 
part.
    (f) Review of facilities with emissions below the exemption amount. 
If, during the review of the information required under paragraph (a)(6) 
of this section, the Regional Supervisor determines or an affected State 
submits information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates, in 
the judgment of the Regional Supervisor, that projected emissions from 
an otherwise exempt facility will, either individually or in combination 
with other facilities in the area, significantly affect the air quality 
of an onshore area, then the Regional Supervisor shall require the 
lessee to submit additional information to determine whether control 
measures are necessary. The lessee shall be given the opportunity to 
present information to the Regional Supervisor which demonstrates that 
the exempt facility is not significantly affecting the air quality of an 
onshore area of the State.
    (g) Emission monitoring requirements. The lessee shall monitor, in a 
manner approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, emissions from 
the facility following the installation of emission controls. The lessee 
shall submit this information monthly in a manner and form approved or 
prescribed by the Regional Supervisor.
    (h) Collection of meteorological data. The Regional Supervisor may 
require the lessee to collect, for a period of time and in a manner 
approved or prescribed by the Regional Supervisor, and submit 
meteorological data from a facility.

drilling unit (MODU)?

    If you plan to use a MODU, you must provide:
    (a) Fitness requirements. You must provide information and data to 
demonstrate the drilling unit's capability to perform at the proposed 
drilling location. This information must include the maximum 
environmental and operational conditions that the unit is designed to 
withstand, including the minimum air gap necessary for both hurricane 
and non-hurricane seasons. If sufficient environmental information and 
data are not available at the time you submit your APD, the District 
Supervisor may approve your APD but require you to collect and report 
this information during operations. Under this circumstance, the 
District Supervisor has the right to revoke the approval of the APD if 
information collected during operations show that the drilling unit is 
not capable of performing at the proposed location.
    (b) Foundation requirements. You must provide information to show 
that site-specific soil and oceanographic conditions are capable of 
supporting the proposed drilling unit. If you provided sufficient site-
specific information in your EP, DPP, or DOCD, you may reference that 
information. The District Supervisor may require you to conduct 
additional surveys and soil borings before approving the APD if 
additional information is needed to make a determination that the 
conditions are capable of supporting the drilling unit.
    (c) Frontier areas. (1) If the design of the drilling unit you plan 
to use in a frontier area is unique or has not been proven for use in 
the proposed environment, the District Supervisor may require you to 
submit a third-party review of the unit's design. If required, you must 
obtain the third-party review according to Sec. 250.903. You may submit 
this information before submitting an APD.
    (2) If you plan to drill in a frontier area, you must have a 
contingency plan that addresses design and operating limitations of the 
drilling unit. Your plan must identify the actions necessary to maintain 
safety and prevent damage to the environment. Actions must include the 
suspension, curtailment, or modification of drilling or rig operations 
to remedy various operational or environmental situations (e.g. vessel 
motion, riser offset, anchor tensions, wind speed, wave height, 
currents, icing or ice-loading, settling, tilt or lateral movement, 
resupply capability).
    (d) U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) documentation. You must provide the 
current Certificate of Inspection or Letter of Compliance from the USCG. 
You must also provide current documentation of any operational 
limitations imposed by an appropriate classification society.

    You must case and cement all wells. Your casing and cementing 
programs must meet the requirements of this section and of Sec. Sec. 
250.421 through 250.428.
    (a) Casing and cementing program requirements. Your casing and 
cementing programs must:
    (1) Properly control formation pressures and fluids;
    (2) Prevent the direct or indirect release of fluids from any 
stratum through the wellbore into offshore waters;
    (3) Prevent communication between separate hydrocarbon-bearing 
strata;
    (4) Protect freshwater aquifers from contamination; and
    (5) Support unconsolidated sediments.
    (b) Casing requirements. (1) You must design casing (including 
liners) to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, 
compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal 
effects; and combinations thereof.
    (2) The casing design must include safety measures that ensure well 
control during drilling and safe operations during the life of the well.
    (c) Cementing requirements. You must design and conduct your 
cementing jobs so that cement composition, placement techniques, and 
waiting times ensure that the cement placed behind the bottom 500 feet 
of casing attains a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before 
drilling out of the casing or before commencing completion operations.

Sec. 250.422  When may I resume drilling after cementing?

    (a) After cementing surface, intermediate, or production casing (or 
liners), you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under 
pressure for 12 hours. For conductor casing, you may resume drilling 
after the cement has been held under pressure for 8 hours. One 
acceptable method of holding cement under pressure is to use float 
valves to hold the cement in place.
    (b) If you plan to nipple down your diverter or BOP stack during the 
8- or 12-hour waiting time, you must determine, before nippling down, 
when it will be safe to do so. You must base your determination on a 
knowledge of formation conditions, cement composition, effects of 
nippling down, presence of potential drilling hazards, well conditions 
during drilling, cementing, and post cementing, as well as past 
experience.

Sec. 250.423  What are the requirements for pressure testing casing?

    The table in this section describes the minimum test pressures for 
each string of casing. You may not resume drilling or other down-hole 
operations until you obtain a satisfactory pressure test. If the 
pressure declines more than 10 percent in a 30-minute test or if there 
is another indication of a leak, you must re-cement, repair the casing, 
or run additional casing to provide a proper seal. The District 
Supervisor may approve or require other casing test pressures.

Sec. 250.424  What are the requirements for prolonged drilling 
operations?

    If wellbore operations continue for more than 30 days within a 
casing string run to the surface:
    (a) You must stop drilling operations as soon as practicable, and 
evaluate the effects of the prolonged operations on continued drilling 
operations and the life of the well. At a minimum, you must:
    (1) Caliper or pressure test the casing; and
    (2) Report the results of your evaluation to the District Supervisor 
and obtain approval of those results before resuming operations.
    (b) If casing integrity has deteriorated to a level below minimum 
safety factors, you must:
    (1) Repair the casing or run another casing string; and
    (2) Obtain approval from the District Supervisor before you begin 
repairs.

Sec. 250.425  What are the requirements for pressure testing liners?

    (a) You must test each drilling liner (and liner-lap) to a pressure 
at least equal to the anticipated pressure to which the liner will be 
subjected during the formation pressure-integrity test below that liner 
shoe, or subsequent liner shoes if set. The District Supervisor may 
approve or require other liner test pressures.
    (b) You must test each production liner (and liner-lap) to a minimum 
of 500 psi above the formation fracture pressure at the casing shoe into 
which the liner is lapped.
    (c) You may not resume drilling or other down-hole operations until 
you obtain a satisfactory pressure test. If the pressure declines more 
than 10 percent in a 30-minute test or if there is another indication of 
a leak, you must re-cement, repair the liner, or run additional casing/
liner to provide a proper seal.

<R05>
Sec. 250.427  What are the requirements for pressure integrity tests?

    You must conduct a pressure integrity test below the surface casing 
or liner and all intermediate casings or liners. The District Supervisor 
may require you to run a pressure-integrity test at the conductor casing 
shoe if warranted by local geologic conditions or the planned casing 
setting depth. You must conduct each pressure integrity test after 
drilling at least 10 feet but no more than 50 feet of new hole below the 
casing shoe. You must test to either the formation leak-off pressure or 
to an equivalent drilling fluid weight if identified in an approved APD.
    (a) You must use the pressure integrity test and related hole-
behavior observations, such as pore-pressure test results, gas-cut 
drilling fluid, and well kicks to adjust the drilling fluid program and 
the setting depth of the next casing string. You must record all test 
results and hole-behavior observations made during the course of 
drilling related to formation integrity and pore pressure in the 
driller's report.
    (b) While drilling, you must maintain the safe drilling margin 
identified in the approved APD. When you cannot maintain this safe 
margin, you must suspend drilling operations and remedy the situation.

following the

[[Page 347]]

conclusion of the previous test. However, the District Supervisor may 
require more frequent testing if conditions or BOP performance warrant; 
and
    (c) Before drilling out each string of casing or a liner. The 
District Supervisor may allow you to omit this test if you didn't remove 
the BOP stack to run the casing string or liner and the required BOP 
test pressures for the next section of the hole are not greater than the 
test pressures for the previous BOP test. You must indicate in your APD 
which casing strings and liners meet these criteria.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.448  What are the BOP pressure tests requirements?

    When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low-
pressure and a high-pressure test for each BOP component. You must 
conduct the low-pressure test before the high-pressure test. Each 
individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate 
that the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. Required test 
pressures are as follows:
    (a) Low-pressure test. All low-pressure tests must be between 200 
and 300 psi. Any initial pressure above 300 psi must be bled back to a 
pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the 
initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and 
reinitiate the test.
    (b) High-pressure test for ram-type BOPs, the choke manifold, and 
other BOP components. The high-pressure test must equal the rated 
working pressure of the equipment or be 500 psi greater than your 
calculated maximum anticipated surface pressure (MASP) for the 
applicable section of hole. Before you may test BOP equipment to the 
MASP plus 500 psi, the District Supervisor must have approved those test 
pressures in your APD.
    (c) High pressure test for annular-type BOPs. The high pressure test 
must equal 70 percent of the rated working pressure of the equipment or 
to a pressure approved in your APD.
    (d) Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required 
pressure for 5 minutes. However, for surface BOP systems and surface 
equipment of a subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable 
if you record your test pressures on the outermost half of a 4-hour 
chart, on a 1-hour chart, or on a digital recorder. If the equipment 
does not hold the required pressure during a test, you must correct the 
problem and retest the affected component(s).

                       Drilling Fluid Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 250.455  What are the general requirements for a drilling fluid 
program?

    You must design and implement your drilling fluid program to prevent 
the loss of well control. This program must address drilling fluid safe 
practices, testing and monitoring equipment, drilling fluid quantities, 
and drilling fluid-handling areas.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.456  What safe practices must the drilling fluid program follow?

    Your drilling fluid program must include the following safe 
practices:
    (a) Before starting out of the hole with drill pipe, you must 
properly condition the drilling fluid. You must circulate a volume of 
drilling fluid equal to the annular volume with the drill pipe just off-
bottom. You may omit this practice if documentation in the driller's 
report shows:
    (1) No indication of formation fluid influx before starting to pull 
the drill pipe from the hole;
    (2) The weight of returning drilling fluid is within 0.2 pounds per 
gallon (1.5 pounds per cubic foot) of the drilling fluid entering the 
hole; and
    (3) Other drilling fluid properties are within the limits 
established by the program approved in the APD.
    (b) Record each time you circulate drilling fluid in the hole in the 
driller's report;
    (c) When coming out of the hole with drill pipe, you must fill the 
annulus with drilling fluid before the hydrostatic pressure decreases by 
75 psi, or

[[Page 349]]

every five stands of drill pipe, whichever gives a lower decrease in 
hydrostatic pressure. You must calculate the number of stands of drill 
pipe and drill collars that you may pull before you must fill the hole. 
You must also calculate the equivalent drilling fluid volume needed to 
fill the hole. Both sets of numbers must be posted near the driller's 
station. You must use a mechanical, volumetric, or electronic device to 
measure the drilling fluid required to fill the hole;
    (d) You must run and pull drill pipe and downhole tools at 
controlled rates so you do not swab or surge the well;
    (e) When there is an indication of swabbing or influx of formation 
fluids, you must take appropriate measures to control the well. You must 
circulate and condition the well, on or near-bottom, unless well or 
drilling-fluid conditions prevent running the drill pipe back to the 
bottom;
    (f) You must calculate and post near the driller's console the 
maximum pressures that you may safely contain under a shut-in BOP for 
each casing string. The pressures posted must consider the surface 
pressure at which the formation at the shoe would break down, the rated 
working pressure of the BOP stack, and 70 percent of casing burst (or 
casing test as approved by the District Supervisor). As a minimum, you 
must post the following two pressures:
    (1) The surface pressure at which the shoe would break down. This 
calculation must consider the current drilling fluid weight in the hole; 
and
    (2) The lesser of the BOP's rated working pressure or 70 percent of 
casing-burst pressure (or casing test otherwise approved by the District 
Supervisor);
    (g) You must install an operable drilling fluid-gas separator and 
degasser before you begin drilling operations. You must maintain this 
equipment throughout the drilling of the well;
    (h) Before pulling drill-stem test tools from the hole, you must 
circulate or reverse-circulate the test fluids in the hole. If 
circulating out test fluids is not feasible, you may bullhead test 
fluids out of the drill-stem test string and tools with an appropriate 
kill weight fluid;
    (i) When circulating, you must test the drilling fluid at least once 
each tour, or more frequently if conditions warrant. Your tests must 
conform to industry-accepted practices and include density, viscosity, 
and gel strength; hydrogenion concentration; filtration; and any other 
tests the District Supervisor requires for monitoring and maintaining 
drilling fluid quality, prevention of downhole equipment problems and 
for kick detection. You must record the results of these tests in the 
drilling fluid report; and
    (j) In areas where permafrost and/or hydrate zones are present or 
may be present, you must control drilling fluid temperatures to drill 
safely through those zones.

<R05>
Sec. 250.457  What equipment is required to monitor drilling fluids?

    Once you establish drilling fluid returns, you must install and 
maintain the following drilling fluid-system monitoring equipment 
throughout subsequent drilling operations. This equipment must have the 
following indicators on the rig floor:
    (a) Pit level indicator to determine drilling fluid-pit volume gains 
and losses. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible 
warning device;
    (b) Volume measuring device to accurately determine drilling fluid 
volumes required to fill the hole on trips;
    (c) Return indicator devices that indicate the relationship between 
drilling fluid-return flow rate and pump discharge rate. This indicator 
must include both a visual and an audible warning device; and
    (d) Gas-detecting equipment to monitor the drilling fluid returns. 
The indicator may be located in the drilling fluid-logging compartment 
or on the rig floor. If the indicators are only in the logging 
compartment, you must continually man the equipment and

[[Page 350]]

have a means of immediate communication with the rig floor. If the 
indicators are on the rig floor only, you must install an audible alarm.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.458  What quantities of drilling fluids are required?

    (a) You must use, maintain, and replenish quantities of drilling 
fluid and drilling fluid materials at the drill site as necessary to 
ensure well control. You must determine those quantities based on known 
or anticipated drilling conditions, rig storage capacity, weather 
conditions, and estimated time for delivery.
    (b) You must record the daily inventories of drilling fluid and 
drilling fluid materials, including weight materials and additives in 
the drilling fluid report.
    (c) If you do not have sufficient quantities of drilling fluid and 
drilling fluid material to maintain well control, you must suspend 
drilling operations.

[68 FR 8423, Feb. 20, 2003]


<R05>
Sec. 250.459  What are the safety requirements for drilling 
fluid-handling areas?

    You must classify drilling fluid-handling areas according to API RP 
500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical 
Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class I, Division 1 
and Division 2 (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 
250.198); or API RP 505, Recommended Practice for Classification of 
Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, 
Classified as Class 1, Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 (incorporated by 
reference as specified in Sec. 250.198). In areas where dangerous 
concentrations of combustible gas may accumulate, you must install and 
maintain a ventilation system and gas monitors. Drilling fluid-handling 
areas must have the following safety equipment:
    (a) A ventilation system capable of replacing the air once every 5 
minutes or 1.0 cubic feet of air-volume flow per minute, per square foot 
of area, whichever is greater. In addition:
    (1) If natural means provide adequate ventilation, then a mechanical 
ventilation system is not necessary;
    (2) If a mechanical system does not run continuously, then it must 
activate when gas detectors indicate the presence of 1 percent or more 
of combustible gas by volume; and
    (3) If discharges from a mechanical ventilation system may be 
hazardous, then you must maintain the drilling fluid-handling area at a 
negative pressure. You must protect the negative pressure area by using 
at least one of the following: a pressure-sensitive alarm, open-door 
alarms on each access to the area, automatic door-closing devices, air 
locks, or other devices approved by the District Supervisor;
    (b) Gas detectors and alarms except in open areas where adequate 
ventilation is provided by natural means. You must test and recalibrate 
gas detectors quarterly. No more than 90 days may elapse between tests;
    (c) Explosion-proof or pressurized electrical equipment to prevent 
the ignition of explosive gases. Where you use air for pressuring 
equipment, you must locate the air intake outside of and as far as 
practicable from hazardous areas; and
    (d) Alarms that activate when the mechanical ventilation system 
fails.

<R05>
Sec. 250.461  What are the requirements for directional and inclination 
surveys?

    For this subpart, MMS classifies a well as vertical if the 
calculated average of inclination readings does not exceed 3 degrees 
from the vertical.
    (a) Survey requirements for a vertical well. (1) You must conduct 
inclination surveys on each vertical well and record the results. Survey 
intervals may not exceed 1,000 feet during the normal course of 
drilling;
    (2) You must also conduct a directional survey that provides both 
inclination and azimuth, and digitally record the results in electronic 
format:
    (i) Within 500 feet of setting surface or intermediate casing;
    (ii) Within 500 feet of setting any liner; and
    (iii) When you reach total depth.
    (b) Survey requirements for directional well. You must conduct 
directional surveys on each directional well and digitally record the 
results. Surveys must give both inclination and azimuth at intervals not 
to exceed 500 feet during the normal course of drilling. Intervals 
during angle-changing portions of the hole may not exceed 100 feet.
    (c) Measurement while drilling. You may use measurement-while-
drilling technology if it meets the requirements of this section.
    (d) Composite survey requirements. (1) Your composite directional 
survey must show the interval from the bottom of the conductor casing to 
total depth. In the absence of conductor casing, the survey must show 
the interval from the bottom of the drive or structural casing to total 
depth; and
    (2) You must correct all surveys to Universal-Transverse-Mercator-
Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north after making the magnetic-to-true-north 
correction. Surveys must show the magnetic and grid corrections used and 
include a listing of the directionally computed inclinations and 
azimuths.
    (e) If you drill within 500 feet of an adjacent lease, the Regional 
Supervisor may require you to furnish a copy of the well's directional 
survey to the affected leaseholder. This could occur when the adjoining 
leaseholder requests a copy of the survey for the protection of 
correlative rights.

<R05>
Sec. 250.462  What are the requirements for well-control drills?

    You must conduct a weekly well-control drill with each drilling 
crew. Your drill must familiarize the crew with its roles and functions 
so that all crew members can perform their duties promptly and 
efficiently.
    (a) Well-control drill plan. You must prepare a well control drill 
plan for each well. Your plan must outline the assignments for each crew 
member and establish times to complete each portion of the drill. You 
must post a copy of the well control drill plan on the rig floor or 
bulletin board.
    (b) Timing of drills. You must conduct each drill during a period of 
activity that minimizes the risk to drilling operations. The timing of 
your drills must cover a range of different operations, including 
drilling with a diverter, on-bottom drilling, and tripping.
    (c) Recordkeeping requirements. For each drill, you must record the 
following in the driller's report:
    (1) The time to be ready to close the diverter or BOP system; and
    (2) The total time to complete the entire drill.
    (d) MMS ordered drill. An MMS authorized representative may require 
you to conduct a well control drill during an MMS inspection. The MMS 
representative will consult with your onsite representative before 
requiring the drill.

a safe distance from the facility in accordance with the positioning 
procedure described in the approved H<INF>2</INF>S Contingency Plan.
    (10) What are the requirements for nearby facilities? The District 
Supervisor may require you to equip nearby facilities with portable or 
fixed H<INF>2</INF>S detector(s) and to test and calibrate those 
detectors. To invoke this requirement, the District Supervisor will 
consider dispersion modeling results from a possible release to 
determine if 20 ppm H<INF>2</INF>S concentration levels could be 
exceeded at nearby facilities.

from facilities to the conditions specified in the H<INF>2</INF>S 
Contingency Plan. During authorized flights, the flight crew and 
passengers must use pressure-demand-type respirators. You must train all 
members of flight crews in the use of the particular type(s) of 
respirator equipment made available.
    (ix) As appropriate to the particular operation(s), (production, 
drilling, well-completion or well-workover operations, or any 
combination of them), provide a system of breathing-air manifolds, 
hoses, and masks at the facility and the briefing areas. You must 
provide a cascade air-bottle system for the breathing-air manifolds to 
refill individual protective-breathing apparatus bottles. The cascade 
air-bottle system may be recharged by a high-pressure compressor 
suitable for providing breathing-quality air, provided the compressor 
suction is located in an uncontaminated atmosphere.

    (k) Personnel safety equipment--(1) What additional personnel-safety 
equipment do I need? You must ensure that your facility has:
    (i) Portable H<INF>2</INF>S detectors capable of detecting a 10 ppm 
concentration of H<INF>2</INF>S in the air available for use by all 
personnel;
    (ii) Retrieval ropes with safety harnesses to retrieve incapacitated 
personnel from contaminated areas;
    (iii) Chalkboards and/or note pads for communication purposes 
located on the rig floor, shale-shaker area, the cement-pump rooms, 
well-bay areas, production processing equipment area, gas compressor 
area, and pipeline-pump area;
    (iv) Bull horns and flashing lights; and
    (v) At least three resuscitators on manned facilities, and a number 
equal to the personnel on board, not to exceed three, on normally 
unmanned facilities, complete with face masks, oxygen bottles, and spare 
oxygen bottles.
    (2) What are the requirements for ventilation equipment? You must:
    (i) Use only explosion-proof ventilation devices;
    (ii) Install ventilation devices in areas where H<INF>2</INF>S or 
SO<INF>2</INF> may accumulate; and
    (iii) Provide movable ventilation devices in work areas. The movable 
ventilation devices must be multidirectional and capable of dispersing 
H<INF>2</INF>S or SO<INF>2</INF> vapors away from working personnel.
    (3) What other personnel safety equipment do I need? You must have 
the following equipment readily available on each facility:
    (i) A first-aid kit of appropriate size and content for the number 
of personnel on the facility; and
    (ii) At least one litter or an equivalent device.
    (l) Do I need to notify MMS in the event of an H<INF>2</INF>S 
release? You must notify MMS without delay in the event of a gas release 
which results in a 15-minute time weighted average atmospheric 
concentration of H<INF>2</INF>S of 20 ppm or more anywhere on the 
facility.
    (m) Do I need to use special drilling, completion and workover 
fluids or procedures? When working in an area classified as 
H<INF>2</INF>S present or H<INF>2</INF>S unknown:
    (1) You may use either water- or oil-base muds in accordance with 
Sec. 250.300(b)(1).
    (2) If you use water-base well-control fluids, and if ambient air 
sensors detect H<INF>2</INF>S, you must immediately conduct either the 
Garrett-Gas-Train test or a comparable test for soluble sulfides to 
confirm the presence of H<INF>2</INF>S.
    (3) If the concentration detected by air sensors in over 20 ppm, 
personnel conducting the tests must don protective-breathing equipment 
conforming to paragraph (j)(13) of this section.
    (4) You must maintain on the facility sufficient quantities of 
additives for the control of H<INF>2</INF>S, well-control fluid pH, and 
corrosion equipment.
    (i) Scavengers. You must have scavengers for control of 
H<INF>2</INF>S available on the facility. When H<INF>2</INF>S is 
detected, you must add scavengers as needed. You must suspend drilling 
until the scavenger is circulated throughout the system.
    (ii) Control pH. You must add additives for the control of pH to 
water-base well-control fluids in sufficient quantities to maintain pH 
of at least 10.0.
    (iii) Corrosion inhibitors. You must add additives to the well-
control fluid system as needed for the control of corrosion.
    (5) You must degas well-control fluids containing H<INF>2</INF>S at 
the optimum location for the particular facility. You must collect the 
gases removed and burn them in a closed flare system conforming to 
paragraph (q)(6) of this section.
    (n) What must I do in the event of a kick? In the event of a kick, 
you must use one of the following alternatives to dispose of the well-
influx fluids giving consideration to personnel safety, possible 
environmental damage, and possible facility well-equipment damage:
    (1) Contain the well-fluid influx by shutting in the well and 
pumping the fluids back into the formation.
    (2) Control the kick by using appropriate well-control techniques to 
prevent formation fracturing in an open hole within the pressure limits 
of the well equipment (drill pipe, work string, casing, wellhead, BOP 
system, and related equipment). The disposal of H<INF>2</INF>S

[[Page 360]]

and other gases must be through pressurized or atmospheric mud-separator 
equipment depending on volume, pressure and concentration of 
H<INF>2</INF>S. The equipment must be designed to recover well-control 
fluids and burn the gases separated from the well-control fluid. The 
well-control fluid must be treated to neutralize H<INF>2</INF>S and 
restore and maintain the proper quality.
    (o) Well testing in a zone known to contain H<INF>2</INF>S. When 
testing a well in a zone with H<INF>2</INF>S present, you must do all of 
the following:
    (1) Before starting a well test, conduct safety meetings for all 
personnel who will be on the facility during the test. At the meetings, 
emphasize the use of protective-breathing equipment, first-aid 
procedures, and the Contingency Plan. Only competent personnel who are 
trained and are knowledgeable of the hazardous effects of H<INF>2</INF>S 
must be engaged in these tests.
    (2) Perform well testing with the minimum number of personnel in the 
immediate vicinity of the rig floor and with the appropriate test 
equipment to safely and adequately perform the test. During the test, 
you must continuously monitor H<INF>2</INF>S levels.
    (3) Not burn produced gases except through a flare which meets the 
requirements of paragraph (q)(6) of this section. Before flaring gas 
containing H<INF>2</INF>S, you must activate SO<INF>2</INF> monitoring 
equipment in accordance with paragraph (j)(11) of this section. If you 
detect SO<INF>2</INF> in excess of 2 ppm, you must implement the 
personnel protective measures in your H<INF>2</INF>S Contingency Plan, 
required by paragraph (f)(13)(iv) of this section. You must also follow 
the requirements of Sec. 250.1105. You must pipe gases from stored test 
fluids into the flare outlet and burn them.
    (4) Use downhole test tools and wellhead equipment suitable for 
H<INF>2</INF>S service.
    (5) Use tubulars suitable for H<INF>2</INF>S service. You must not 
use drill pipe for well testing without the prior approval of the 
District Supervisor. Water cushions must be thoroughly inhibited in 
order to prevent H<INF>2</INF>S attack on metals. You must flush the 
test string fluid treated for this purpose after completion of the test.
    (6) Use surface test units and related equipment that is designed 
for H<INF>2</INF>S service.
    (p) Metallurgical properties of equipment. When operating in a zone 
with H<INF>2</INF>S present, you must use equipment that is constructed 
of materials with metallurgical properties that resist or prevent 
sulfide stress cracking (also known as hydrogen embrittlement, stress 
corrosion cracking, or H<INF>2</INF>S embrittlement), chloride-stress 
cracking, hydrogen-induced cracking, and other failure modes. You must 
do all of the following:
    (1) Use tubulars and other equipment, casing, tubing, drill pipe, 
couplings, flanges, and related equipment that is designed for 
H<INF>2</INF>S service.
    (2) Use BOP system components, wellhead, pressure-control equipment, 
and related equipment exposed to H<INF>2</INF>S-bearing fluids in 
conformance with NACE Standard MR0175-99 (incorporated by reference as 
specified in Sec. 250.198).
    (3) Use temporary downhole well-security devices such as retrievable 
packers and bridge plugs that are designed for H<INF>2</INF>S service.
    (4) When producing in zones bearing H<INF>2</INF>S, use equipment 
constructed of materials capable of resisting or preventing sulfide 
stress cracking.
    (5) Keep the use of welding to a minimum during the installation or 
modification of a production facility. Welding must be done in a manner 
that ensures resistance to sulfide stress cracking.
    (q) General requirements when operating in an H<INF>2</INF>S zone--
(1) Coring operations. When you conduct coring operations in 
H<INF>2</INF>S-bearing zones, all personnel in the working area must 
wear protective-breathing equipment at least 10 stands in advance of 
retrieving the core barrel. Cores to be transported must be sealed and 
marked for the presence of H<INF>2</INF>S.
    (2) Logging operations. You must treat and condition well-control 
fluid in use for logging operations to minimize the effects of 
H<INF>2</INF>S on the logging equipment.
    (3) Stripping operations. Personnel must monitor displaced well-
control fluid returns and wear protective-breathing equipment in the 
working

[[Page 361]]

area when the atmospheric concentration of H<INF>2</INF>S reaches 20 ppm 
or if the well is under pressure.
    (4) Gas-cut well-control fluid or well kick from H<INF>2</INF>S-
bearing zone. If you decide to circulate out a kick, personnel in the 
working area during bottoms-up and extended-kill operations must wear 
protective-breathing equipment.
    (5) Drill- and workover-string design and precautions. Drill- and 
workover-strings must be designed consistent with the anticipated depth, 
conditions of the hole, and reservoir environment to be encountered. You 
must minimize exposure of the drill- or workover-string to high stresses 
as much as practical and consistent with well conditions. Proper 
handling techniques must be taken to minimize notching and stress 
concentrations. Precautions must be taken to minimize stresses caused by 
doglegs, improper stiffness ratios, improper torque, whip, abrasive wear 
on tool joints, and joint imbalance.
    (6) Flare system. The flare outlet must be of a diameter that allows 
easy nonrestricted flow of gas. You must locate flare line outlets on 
the downside of the facility and as far from the facility as is 
feasible, taking into account the prevailing wind directions, the wake 
effects caused by the facility and adjacent structure(s), and the height 
of all such facilities and structures. You must equip the flare outlet 
with an automatic ignition system including a pilot-light gas source or 
an equivalent system. You must have alternate methods for igniting the 
flare. You must pipe to the flare system used for H<INF>2</INF>S all 
vents from production process equipment, tanks, relief valves, burst 
plates, and similar devices.
    (7) Corrosion mitigation. You must use effective means of monitoring 
and controlling corrosion caused by acid gases (H<INF>2</INF>S and 
CO<INF>2</INF>) in both the downhole and surface portions of a 
production system. You must take specific corrosion monitoring and 
mitigating measures in areas of unusually severe corrosion where 
accumulation of water and/or higher concentration of H<INF>2</INF>S 
exists.
    (8) Wireline lubricators. Lubricators which may be exposed to fluids 
containing H<INF>2</INF>S must be of H<INF>2</INF>S-resistant materials.
    (9) Fuel and/or instrument gas. You must not use gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF>S for instrument gas. You must not use gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF>S for fuel gas without the prior approval of the District 
Supervisor.
    (10) Sensing lines and devices. Metals used for sensing line and 
safety-control devices which are necessarily exposed to H<INF>2</INF>S-
bearing fluids must be constructed of H<INF>2</INF>S-corrosion resistant 
materials or coated so as to resist H<INF>2</INF>S corrosion.
    (11) Elastomer seals. You must use H<INF>2</INF>S-resistant 
materials for all seals which may be exposed to fluids containing 
H<INF>2</INF>S.
    (12) Water disposal. If you dispose of produced water by means other 
than subsurface injection, you must submit to the District Supervisor an 
analysis of the anticipated H<INF>2</INF>S content of the water at the 
final treatment vessel and at the discharge point. The District 
Supervisor may require that the water be treated for removal of 
H<INF>2</INF>S. The District Supervisor may require the submittal of an 
updated analysis if the water disposal rate or the potential 
H<INF>2</INF>S content increases.
    (13) Deck drains. You must equip open deck drains with traps or 
similar devices to prevent the escape of H<INF>2</INF>S gas into the 
atmosphere.
    (14) Sealed voids. You must take precautions to eliminate sealed 
spaces in piping designs (e.g., slip-on flanges, reinforcing pads) which 
can be invaded by atomic hydrogen when H<INF>2</INF>S is present.

Sec. 250.516  Blowout preventer system tests, inspections, and 
maintenance.

    (a) BOP pressure testing timeframes. You must pressure test your BOP 
system:
    (1) When installed; and
    (2) Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test. 
You must begin to test your BOP system before 12 a.m. (midnight) on the 
14th day following the conclusion of the previous test. However, the 
District Supervisor may require testing every 7 days if conditions or 
BOP performance warrant.
    (b) BOP test pressures. When you test the BOP system, you must 
conduct a low pressure and a high pressure test for each BOP component. 
Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to 
demonstrate that the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. 
The District Supervisor may approve or require other test pressures or 
practices. Required test pressures are as follows:
    (1) All low pressure tests must be between 200 and 300 psi. Any 
initial pressure above 300 psi must be bled back to a pressure between 
200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the initial pressure 
exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and reinitiate the test. 
You must conduct the low pressure test before the high pressure test.
    (2) For ram-type BOP's, choke manifold, and other BOP equipment, the 
high pressure test must equal the rated working pressure of the 
equipment.
    (3) For annular-type BOP's, the high pressure test must equal 70 
percent of the rated working pressure of the equipment.
    (c) Duration of pressure test. Each test must hold the required 
pressure for 5 minutes.
    (1) For surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP 
system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if you record your test 
pressures on the outermost half of a 4-hour chart, on a 1-hour chart, or 
on a digital recorder.
    (2) If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a 
test, you must remedy the problem and retest the affected component(s).
    (d) Additional BOP testing requirements. You must:

[[Page 366]]

    (1) Use water to test the surface BOP system;
    (2) Stump test a subsurface BOP system before installation. You must 
use water to stump test a subsea BOP system. You may use drilling or 
completion fluids to conduct subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system;
    (3) Alternate tests between control stations and pods. If a control 
station or pod is not functional, you must suspend further completion 
operations until that station or pod is operable;
    (4) Pressure test the blind or blind-shear ram at least every 30 
days;
    (5) Function test annulars and rams every 7 days;
    (6) Pressure-test variable bore-pipe rams against all sizes of pipe 
in use, excluding drill collars and bottom-hole tools; and
    (7) Test affected BOP components following the disconnection or 
repair of any well-pressure containment seal in the wellhead or BOP 
stack assembly;
    (e) Postponing BOP tests. You may postpone a BOP test if you have 
well-control problems. You must conduct the required BOP test as soon as 
possible (i.e., first trip out of the hole) after the problem has been 
remedied. You must record the reason for postponing any test in the 
driller's report.
    (f) Weekly crew drills. You must conduct a weekly drill to 
familiarize all personnel engaged in well-completion operations with 
appropriate safety measures.
    (g) BOP inspections. You must visually inspect your BOP system and 
marine riser at least once each day if weather and sea conditions 
permit. You may use television cameras to inspect this equipment. The 
District Supervisor may approve alternate methods and frequencies to 
inspect a marine riser.
    (h) BOP maintenance. You must maintain your BOP system to ensure 
that the equipment functions properly.
    (i) BOP test records. You must record the time, date, and results of 
all pressure tests, actuations, crew drills, and inspections of the BOP 
system, system components, and marine riser in the driller's report. In 
addition, you must:
    (1) Record BOP test pressures on pressure charts;
    (2) Have your onsite representative certify (sign and date) BOP test 
charts and reports as correct;
    (3) Document the sequential order of BOP and auxiliary equipment 
testing and the pressure and duration of each test. You may reference a 
BOP test plan if it is available at the facility;
    (4) Identify the control station or pod used during the test;
    (5) Identify any problems or irregularities observed during BOP 
system and equipment testing and record actions taken to remedy the 
problems or irregularities;
    (6) Retain all records including pressure charts, driller's report, 
and referenced documents pertaining to BOP tests, actuations, and 
inspections at the facility for the duration of the completion activity; 
and
    (7) After completion of the well, you must retain all the records 
listed in paragraph (i)(6) of this section for a period of 2 years at 
the facility, at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility, or 
at another location conveniently available to the District Supervisor.
    (j) Alternate methods. The District Supervisor may require, or 
approve, more frequent testing, as well as different test pressures and 
inspection methods, or other practices.

    (2) You may use a set of hydraulically-operated combination rams for 
the blind rams and shear rams.
    (3) You may use a set of hydraulically-operated combination rams for 
the hydraulic two-way slip rams and the hydraulically-operated pipe 
rams.
    (4) You must attach a dual check valve assembly to the coiled tubing 
connector at the downhole end of the coiled tubing string for all coiled 
tubing well-workover operations. If you plan to conduct operations 
without downhole check valves, you must describe alternate procedures 
and equipment in Form MMS-124, Application for Permit to Modify and have 
it approved by the District Manager.
    (5) You must have a kill line and a separate choke line. You must 
equip each line with two full-opening valves and at least one of the 
valves must be remotely controlled. You may use a manual valve instead 
of the remotely controlled valve on the kill line if you install a check 
valve between the two full-opening manual valves and the pump or 
manifold. The valves must have a working pressure rating equal to or 
greater than the working pressure rating of the connection to which they 
are attached, and you must install them between the well control stack 
and the choke or kill line. For operations with expected surface 
pressures greater than 3,500 psi, the kill line must be connected to a 
pump or manifold. You must not use the kill line inlet on the BOP stack 
for taking fluid returns from the wellbore.
    (6) You must have a hydraulic-actuating system that provides 
sufficient accumulator capacity to close-open-close each component in 
the BOP stack. This cycle must be completed with at least 200 psi above 
the pre-charge pressure, without assistance from a charging system.
    (7) All connections used in the surface BOP system from the tree to 
the uppermost required ram must be flanged, including the connections 
between the well control stack and the first full-opening valve on the 
choke line and the kill line.
    (f) The minimum BOP-system components for well-workover operations 
with the tree in place and performed by moving tubing or drill pipe in 
or out of a well under pressure utilizing equipment specifically 
designed for that purpose, i.e., snubbing operations, shall include the 
following:
    (1) One set of pipe rams hydraulically operated, and
    (2) Two sets of stripper-type pipe rams hydraulically operated with 
spacer spool.
    (g) An inside BOP or a spring-loaded, back-pressure safety valve and 
an essentially full-opening, work-string safety valve in the open 
position shall be maintained on the rig floor at all times during well-
workover operations when the tree is removed or during well-workover 
operations with the tree

Sec. 250.616  Blowout preventer system testing, records, and drills.

    (a) BOP pressure tests. When you pressure test the BOP system you 
must conduct a low-pressure test and a high-pressure test for each 
component. You must conduct the low-pressure test before the high-
pressure test. For purposes of this section, BOP system components 
include ram-type BOP's, related control equipment, choke and kill lines, 
and valves, manifolds, strippers, and safety valves. Surface BOP systems 
must be pressure tested with water.
    (1) Low pressure tests. All BOP system components must be 
successfully tested to a low pressure between 200 and 300 psi. Any 
initial pressure equal to or greater than 300 psi must be bled back to a 
pressure between 200 and 300 psi before starting the test. If the 
initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero before 
starting the test.
    (2) High pressure tests. All BOP system components must be 
successfully tested to the rated working pressure of the BOP equipment, 
or as otherwise approved by the District Manager. The annular-type BOP 
must be successfully tested at 70 percent of its rated working pressure 
or as otherwise approved by the District Manager.
    (3) Other testing requirements. Variable bore pipe rams must be 
pressure tested against the largest and smallest sizes of tubulars in 
use (jointed pipe, seamless pipe) in the well.
    (b) The BOP systems shall be tested at the following times:
    (1) When installed;
    (2) At least every 7 days, alternating between control stations and 
at staggered intervals to allow each crew to operate the equipment. If 
either control system is not functional, further operations shall be 
suspended until the nonfunctional, system is operable. The test every 7 
days is not required for blind or blind-shear rams. The blind or blind-
shear rams shall be tested at least once every 30 days during operation. 
A longer period between blowout preventer tests is allowed when there is 
a stuck pipe or pressure-control operation and remedial efforts are 
being performed. The tests shall be conducted as soon as possible and 
before normal operations resume. The reason for postponing testing shall 
be entered into the operations log.
    (3) Following repairs that require disconnecting a pressure seal in 
the assembly, the affected seal will be pressure tested.
    (c) All personnel engaged in well-workover operations shall 
participate in a weekly BOP drill to familiarize crew members with 
appropriate safety measures.
    (d) You may conduct a stump test for the BOP system on location. A 
plan describing the stump test procedures must be included in your Form 
MMS-124, Application for Permit to Modify, and must be approved by the 
District Manager.
    (e) You must test the coiled tubing connector to a low pressure of 
200 to 300 psi, followed by a high pressure test to the rated working 
pressure of the connector or the expected surface pressure, whichever is 
less. You must successfully pressure test the dual check valves to the 
rated working pressure of the connector, the rated working pressure of 
the dual check valve, expected surface pressure, or the collapse 
pressure of the coiled tubing, whichever is less.
    (f) You must record test pressures during BOP and coiled tubing 
tests on a pressure chart, or with a digital recorder, unless otherwise 
approved by the District Manager. The test interval for each BOP system 
component must be 5 minutes, except for coiled tubing operations, which 
must include a 10 minute high-pressure test for the coiled tubing 
string. Your representative at the facility must certify that the charts 
are correct.

[[Page 373]]

    (g) The time, date, and results of all pressure tests, actuations, 
inspections, and crew drills of the BOP system, system components, and 
marine risers shall be recorded in the operations log. The BOP tests 
shall be documented in accordance with the following:
    (1) The documentation shall indicate the sequential order of BOP and 
auxiliary equipment testing and the pressure and duration of each test. 
As an alternate, the documentation in the operations log may reference a 
BOP test plan that contains the required information and is retained on 
file at the facility.
    (2) The control station used during the test shall be identified in 
the operations log. For a subsea system, the pod used during the test 
shall be identified in the operations log.
    (3) Any problems or irregularities observed during BOP and auxiliary 
equipment testing and any actions taken to remedy such problems or 
irregularities shall be noted in the operations log.
    (4) Documentation required to be entered in the operation log may 
instead be referenced in the operations log. All records including 
pressure charts, operations log, and referenced documents pertaining to 
BOP tests, actuations, and inspections, shall be available for MMS 
review at the facility for the duration of well-workover activity. 
Following completion of the well-workover activity, all such records 
shall be retained for a period of 2 years at the facility, at the 
lessee's filed office nearest the OCS facility, or at another location 
conveniently available to the District Supervisor.

    The lessee shall comply with the following requirements during well-
workover operations with the tree removed:
    (a) No tubing string shall be placed in service or continue to be 
used unless such tubing string has the necessary strength and pressure 
integrity and is otherwise suitable for its intended use.
    (b) In the event of prolonged operations such as milling, fishing, 
jarring, or washing over that could damage the casing, the casing shall 
be pressure tested, calipered, or otherwise evaluated every 30 days and 
the results submitted to the District Supervisor.
    (c) When reinstalling the tree, the wellhead shall be equipped so 
that all annuli can be monitored for sustained pressure. If sustained 
casing pressure is observed on a well, the lessee shall immediately 
notify the District Supervisor.

<R05>
Sec. 250.801  Subsurface safety devices.

    (a) General. All tubing installations open to hydrocarbon-bearing 
zones shall be equipped with subsurface safety devices that will shut 
off the flow from the well in the event of an emergency unless, after 
application and justification, the well is determined by the District 
Supervisor to be incapable of natural flowing. These devices may consist 
of a surface-controlled subsurface safety valve (SSSV), a subsurface-
controlled SSSV, an injection valve, a tubing plug, or a tubing/annular 
subsurface safety device, and any associated safety valve lock or 
landing nipple.
    (b) Specifications for SSSV's. Surface-controlled and subsurface-
controlled SSSV's and safety valve locks and landing nipples installed 
in the OCS shall conform to the requirements in Sec. 250.806 of this 
part.
    (c) Surface-controlled SSSV's. All tubing installations open to a 
hydrocarbon-bearing zone which is capable of natural flow shall be 
equipped with a surface-controlled SSSV, except as specified in 
paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section. The surface controls may 
be located on the site or a remote location. Wells not previously 
equipped with a surface-controlled SSSV and wells in which a surface-
controlled SSSV has been replaced with a subsurface-controlled SSSV in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be equipped with 
a surface-controlled SSSV when the tubing is first removed and 
reinstalled.
    (d) Subsurface-controlled SSSV's. Wells may be equipped with 
subsurface-controlled SSSV's in lieu of a surface-controlled SSSV 
provided the lessee demonstrates to the District Supervisor's 
satisfaction that one of the following criteria are met:
    (1) Wells not previously equipped with surface-controlled SSSV's 
shall be so equipped when the tubing is first removed and reinstalled,
    (2) The subsurface-controlled SSSV is installed in wells completed 
from a single-well or multiwell satellite caisson or seafloor 
completions, or
    (3) The subsurface-controlled SSSV is installed in wells with a 
surface-controlled SSSV that has become inoperable and cannot be 
repaired without removal and reinstallation of the tubing.
    (e) Design, installation, and operation of SSSV's. The SSSV's shall 
be designed, installed, operated, and maintained to ensure reliable 
operation.
    (1) The device shall be installed at a depth of 100 feet or more 
below the seafloor within 2 days after production is established. When 
warranted by conditions such as permafrost, unstable

[[Page 375]]

bottom conditions, hydrate formation, or paraffins, an alternate setting 
depth of the subsurface safety device may be approved by the District 
Supervisor.
    (2) Until a subsurface safety device is installed, the well shall be 
attended in the immediate vicinity so that emergency actions may be 
taken while the well is open to flow. During testing and inspection 
procedures, the well shall not be left unattended while open to 
production unless a properly operating subsurface-safety device has been 
installed in the well.
    (3) The well shall not be open to flow while the subsurface safety 
device is removed, except when flowing of the well is necessary for a 
particular operation such as cutting paraffin, bailing sand, or similar 
operations.
    (4) All SSSV's shall be inspected, installed, maintained, and tested 
in accordance with American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practice 
14B, Recommended Practice for Design, Installation, and Operation of 
Subsurface Safety Valve Systems.
    (f) Subsurface safety devices in shut-in wells. New completions 
(perforated but not placed on production) and completions shut in for a 
period of 6 months shall be equipped with either (1) a pump-through-type 
tubing plug; (2) a surface-controlled SSSV, provided the surface control 
has been rendered inoperative; or (3) an injection valve capable of 
preventing backflow. The setting depth of the subsurface safety device 
shall be approved by the District Supervisor on a case-by-case basis, 
when warranted by conditions such as permafrost, unstable bottom 
conditions, hydrate formations, and paraffins.
    (g) Subsurface safety devices in injection wells. A surface-
controlled SSSV or an injection valve capable of preventing backflow 
shall be installed in all injection wells. This requirement is not 
applicable if the District Supervisor concurs that the well is incapable 
of flowing. The lessee shall verify the no-flow condition of the well 
annually.
    (h) Temporary removal for routine operations. (1) Each wireline- or 
pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device may be removed, without 
further authorization or notice, for a routine operation which does not 
require the approval of a Form MMS-124, Sundry Notices and Reports on 
Wells, in Sec. 250.601 of this part for a period not to exceed 15 days.
    (2) The well shall be identified by a sign on the wellhead stating 
that the subsurface safety device has been removed. The removal of the 
subsurface safety device shall be noted in the records as required in 
Sec. 250.804(b) of this part. If the master valve is open, a trained 
person shall be in the immediate vicinity of the well to attend the well 
so that emergency actions may be taken, if necessary.
    (3) A platform well shall be monitored, but a person need not remain 
in the well-bay area continuously if the master valve is closed. If the 
well is on a satellite structure, it must be attended or a pump-through 
plug installed in the tubing at least 100 feet below the mud line and 
the master valve closed, unless otherwise approved by the District 
Supervisor.
    (4) The well shall not be allowed to flow while the subsurface 
safety device is removed, except when flowing the well is necessary for 
that particular operation. The provisions of this paragraph are not 
applicable to the testing and inspection procedures in Sec. 250.804 of 
this part.
    (i) Additional safety equipment. All tubing installations in which a 
wireline- or pumpdown-retrievable subsurface safety device is installed 
after the effective date of this subpart shall be equipped with a 
landing nipple with flow couplings or other protective equipment above 
and below to provide for the setting of the SSSV. The control system for 
all surface-controlled SSSV's shall be an integral part of the platform 
Emergency Shutdown System (ESD). In addition to the activation of the 
ESD by manual action on the platform, the system may be activated by a 
signal from a remote location. Surface-controlled SSSV's shall close in 
response to shut-in signals from the ESD and in response to the fire 
loop or other fire detection devices.
    (j) Emergency action. In the event of an emergency, such as an 
impending storm, any well not equipped with a subsurface safety device 
and which is capable of natural flow shall have the device properly 
installed as soon as

[[Page 376]]

Sec. 250.803  Additional production system requirements.

    (a) For all production platforms, you must comply with the following 
production safety system requirements, in addition to the requirements 
of Sec. 250.802 of this subpart and the requirements of API RP 14C 
(incorporated by reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198).
    (b) Design, installation, and operation of additional production 
systems--(1) Pressure and fired vessels. Pressure and fired vessels must 
be designed, fabricated, and code stamped in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of Sections I, IV, and VIII of the American 
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. 
Pressure and fired vessels must have maintenance inspection, rating, 
repair, and alteration performed in accordance with the applicable 
provisions of the American Petroleum Institute's Pressure Vessel 
Inspection Code: Maintenance Inspection, Rating, Repair, and Alteration 
API 510 (except Sections 6.5 and 8.5), which is incorporated by 
reference in Sec. 250.198.
    (i) Pressure relief valves shall be designed, installed, and 
maintained in accordance with applicable provisions of sections I, IV, 
and VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The relief valves 
shall conform to the valve-sizing and pressure-relieving requirements 
specified in these documents; however, the relief valves, except 
completely redundant relief valves, shall be set no higher than the 
maximum-allowable working pressure of the vessel. All relief valves and 
vents shall be piped in such a way as to prevent fluid from striking 
personnel or ignition sources.
    (ii) Steam generators operating at less than 15 pounds per square 
inch gauge (psig) shall be equipped with a level safety low (LSL) sensor 
which will shut off the fuel supply when the water level drops below the 
minimum safe level. Steam generators operating at greater than 15 psig 
require, in addition to an LSL, a water-feeding device which will 
automatically control the water level.
    (iii) The lessee shall use pressure recorders to establish the new 
operating pressure ranges of pressure vessels at any time when there is 
a change in operating pressures that requires new settings for the high-
pressure shut-in sensor and/or the low-pressure shut-in sensor as 
provided herein. The pressure-recorder charts used to determine current 
operating pressure ranges shall be maintained at the lessee's field 
office nearest the OCS facility or at other locations conveniently 
available to the District Supervisor. The high-pressure shut-in sensor 
shall be set no higher than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, 
above the highest operating pressure of the vessel. This setting shall 
also be set sufficiently below (5 percent or 5 psi, whichever is 
greater) the relief valve's set pressure to assure that the pressure 
source is shut in before the relief valve activates. The low-pressure 
shut-in sensor shall activate no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi, 
whichever is greater, below the lowest pressure in the operating range. 
The activation of low-pressure sensors on pressure vessels which operate 
at less than 5 psi shall be approved by the District Supervisor on a 
case-by-case basis.
    (2) Flowlines. (i) You must equip flowlines from wells with high- 
and

low-pressure shut-in sensors located in accordance with section A.1 and 
Figure A1 of API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 
250.198). The lessee shall use pressure recorders to establish the new 
operating pressure ranges of flowlines at any time when there is a 
significant change in operating pressures. The most recent pressure-
recorder charts used to determine operating pressure ranges shall be 
maintained at the lessee's field office nearest the OCS facility or at 
other locations conveniently available to the District Supervisor. The 
high-pressure shut-in sensor(s) shall be set no higher than 15 percent 
or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above the highest operating pressure of 
the line. But in all cases, it shall be set sufficiently below the 
maximum shut-in wellhead pressure or the gas-lift supply pressure to 
assure actuation of the SSV. The low-pressure shut-in sensor(s) shall be 
set no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, below the 
lowest operating pressure of the line in which it is installed.
    (ii) If a well flows directly to the pipeline before separation, the 
flowline and valves from the well located upstream of and including the 
header inlet valve(s) shall have a working pressure equal to or greater 
than the maximum shut-in pressure of the well unless the flowline is 
protected by one of the following:
    (A) A relief valve which vents into the platform flare scrubber or 
some other location approved by the District Supervisor. The platform 
flare scrubber shall be designed to handle, without liquid-hydrocarbon 
carryover to the flare, the maximum-anticipated flow of liquid 
hydrocarbons which may be relieved to the vessel.
    (B) Two SSV's with independent high-pressure sensors installed with 
adequate volume upstream of any block valve to allow sufficient time for 
the valve(s) to close before exceeding the maximum allowable working 
pressure.
    (iii) If you are installing flowlines constructed of unbonded 
flexible pipe on a floating platform, you must:
    (A) Review the manufacturer's Design Methodology Verification Report 
and the independent verification agent's (IVA's) certificate for the 
design methodology contained in that report to ensure that the

regulation concerning the following:
    (i) Automatic fail-close SSV's on wellhead assemblies, and
    (ii) The PSH and PSL shut-in sensors in flowlines from wells.
    (3) When pressure or atmospheric vessels are isolated from 
production facilities (e.g., inlet valve locked closed or inlet blind-
flanged) and are to remain isolated for an extended period of time, 
safety device compliance with API RP 14C or this subpart is not 
required.
    (4) All open-ended lines connected to producing facilities and wells 
shall be plugged or blind-flanged, except those lines designed to be 
open-ended such as flare or vent lines.
    (d) Welding and burning practices and procedures. All welding,

Sec. 250.906  What must I do to obtain approval for the proposed site of 
my platform?

    (a) Shallow hazards surveys. You must perform a high-resolution or 
acoustic-profiling survey to obtain information on the conditions 
existing at and near the surface of the seafloor. You must collect 
information through this survey sufficient to determine the presence of 
the following features and their likely effects on your proposed 
platform:
    (1) Shallow faults;
    (2) Gas seeps or shallow gas;
    (3) Slump blocks or slump sediments;
    (4) Shallow water flows;
    (5) Hydrates; or
    (6) Ice scour of seafloor sediments.
    (b) Geologic surveys. You must perform a geological survey relevant 
to the design and siting of your platform. Your geological survey must 
assess:
    (1) Seismic activity at your proposed site;
    (2) Fault zones, the extent and geometry of faulting, and 
attenuation effects of geologic conditions near your site; and
    (3) For platforms located in producing areas, the possibility and 
effects of seafloor subsidence.
    (c) Subsurface surveys. Depending upon the design and location of 
your proposed platform and the results of

[[Page 388]]

the shallow hazard and geologic surveys, the Regional Supervisor may 
require you to perform a subsurface survey. This survey will include a 
testing program for investigating the stratigraphic and engineering 
properties of the soil that may affect the foundations or anchoring 
systems for your facility. The testing program must include adequate in 
situ testing, boring, and sampling to examine all important soil and 
rock strata to determine its strength classification, deformation 
properties, and dynamic characteristics. If required to perform a 
subsurface survey, you must prepare and submit to the Regional 
Supervisor a summary report to briefly describe the results of your soil 
testing program, the various field and laboratory test methods employed, 
and the applicability of these methods as they pertain to the quality of 
the samples, the type of soil, and the anticipated design application. 
You must explain how the engineering properties of each soil stratum 
affect the design of your platform. In your explanation you must 
describe the uncertainties inherent in your overall testing program, and 
the reliability and applicability of each test method.
    (d) Overall site investigation report. You must prepare and submit 
to the Regional Supervisor an overall site investigation report for your 
platform that integrates the findings of your shallow hazards surveys 
and geologic surveys, and, if required, your subsurface surveys. Your 
overall site investigation report must include analyses of the potential 
for:
    (1) Scouring of the seafloor;
    (2) Hydraulic instability;
    (3) The occurrence of sand waves;
    (4) Instability of slopes at the platform location;
    (5) Liquifaction, or possible reduction of soil strength due to 
increased pore pressures;
    (6) Degradation of subsea permafrost layers;
    (7) Cyclic loading;
    (8) Lateral loading;
    (9) Dynamic loading;
    (10) Settlements and displacements;
    (11) Plastic deformation and formation collapse mechanisms; and
    (12) Soil reactions on the platform foundations or anchoring 
systems.

Sec. 250.907  Where must I locate foundation boreholes?

    (a) For fixed or bottom-founded platforms and tension leg platforms, 
your maximum distance from any foundation pile to a soil boring must not 
exceed 500 feet.
    (b) For deepwater floating platforms which utilize catenary or taut-
leg moorings, you must take borings at the most heavily loaded anchor 
location, at the anchor points approximately 120 and 240 degrees around 
the anchor pattern from that boring, and, as necessary, other points 
throughout the anchor pattern to establish the soil profile suitable for 
foundation design purposes.

                      Platform Verification Program


<R05>
Sec. 250.909  What is the Platform Verification Program?

    The Platform Verification Program is the MMS approval process for 
ensuring that floating platforms; platforms of a new or unique design; 
platforms in seismic areas; or platforms located in deepwater or 
frontier areas meet stringent requirements for design and construction. 
The program is applied during construction of new platforms and major 
modifications of, or repairs to, existing platforms. These requirements 
are in addition to the requirements of the Platform Approval Program 
described in Sec. Sec. 250.904 through 250.908 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 250.910  Which of my facilities are subject to the Platform 
Verification Program?

    (a) All new fixed or bottom-founded platforms that meet any of the 
following five conditions are subject to the Platform Verification 
Program:
    (1) Platforms installed in water depths exceeding 400 feet (122 
meters);
    (2) Platforms having natural periods in excess of 3 seconds;
    (3) Platforms installed in areas of unstable bottom conditions;
    (4) Platforms having configurations and designs which have not 
previously been used or proven for use in the area; or
    (5) Platforms installed in seismically active areas.
    (b) All new floating platforms are subject to the Platform 
Verification Program to the extent indicated in the following table:

    (c) If a platform is originally subject to the Platform Verification 
Program, then the conversion of that platform at that same site for a 
new purpose, or making a major modification of, or major repair to, that 
platform, is also subject to the Platform Verification Program. A major 
modification includes any modification that increases loading on a 
platform by 10 percent or more. A major repair is a corrective operation 
involving structural members affecting the structural integrity of a 
portion or all of the platform. Before you make a major modification or 
repair to a floating platform, you must obtain approval from both the 
MMS and the USCG.
    (d) The applicability of Platform Verification Program requirements 
to other types of facilities will be determined by MMS on a case-by-case 
basis.

          Inspection, Maintenance, and Assessment of Platforms


<R05>
Sec. 250.919  What in-service inspection requirements must I meet?

    (a) You must develop a comprehensive annual in-service inspection 
plan covering all of your platforms. As a minimum, your plan must 
address the recommendations of the appropriate documents listed in Sec. 
250.901(a). Your plan must specify the type, extent, and frequency of 
in-place inspections which you will conduct for both the above water and 
the below water structure of all platforms, and pertinent components of 
the mooring systems for floating platforms. The plan must also address 
how you are monitoring the corrosion protection for both the above water 
and below water structure.
    (b) You must submit a report annually on November 1 to the Regional 
Supervisor that must include:
    (1) A list of fixed or floating platforms inspected in the preceding 
12 months;
    (2) The extent and area of inspection;
    (3) The type of inspection employed, (i.e., visual, magnetic 
particle, ultrasonic testing); and
    (4) A summary of the testing results indicating what repairs, if 
any, were needed and the overall structural condition of the fixed or 
floating platform.


<R05>
Sec. 250.920  What are the MMS requirements for assessment of platforms?

    (a) You must perform a platform assessment when needed, based on the 
platform assessment initiators listed in sections 17.2.1-17.2.5 of API 
RP 2A-WSD, Recommended Practice for Planning, Designing and Constructing 
Fixed Offshore Platforms--Working Stress Design (incorporated by 
reference as specified in 30 CFR 250.198).
    (b) You must initiate mitigation actions for platforms that do not 
pass the assessment process of API RP 2A-WSD.
    (c) You must document all wells, equipment, and pipelines supported 
by the platform if you intend to use the medium or low consequence of 
failure exposure category for your assessment. Exposure categories are 
defined in API RP 2A-WSD Section 1.7.
    (d) MMS may require you to conduct a platform assessment where 
reduced environmental loading criteria are not allowed.
    (e) The use of Section 17, Assessment of Existing Platforms, of API 
RP 2A-WSD, is limited to existing fixed structures that are serving 
their original approved purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 250.921  How do I analyze my platform for cumulative fatigue?

    (a) If you are required to analyze cumulative fatigue on your 
platform because of the results of an inspection or platform assessment, 
you must ensure that the safety factors for critical elements listed in 
Sec. 250.908 are met or exceeded.
    (b) If the calculated life of a joint or member does not meet the 
criteria of Sec. 250.908, you must either mitigate the load, strengthen 
the joint or member, or develop an increased inspection process.

             Subpart J_Pipelines and Pipeline Rights-of-Way


<R05>
Sec. 250.1000  General requirements.

    (a) Pipelines and associated valves, flanges, and fittings shall be 
designed, installed, operated, maintained, and abandoned to provide safe 
and pollution-free transportation of fluids in a

[[Page 395]]

manner which does not unduly interfere with other uses in the Outer 
Continental Shelf (OCS).
    (b) An application shall be submitted to the Regional Supervisor and 
approval obtained prior to the installation, modification, or 
abandonment of a pipeline which qualifies as a lease term pipeline (see 
Sec. 250.1001, Definitions) and prior to the installation of a right-
of-way pipeline or the modification or relinquishment of a pipeline 
right-of-way.
    (c)(1) Department of the Interior (DOI) pipelines, as defined in 
Sec. 250.1001, must meet the requirements in Sec. Sec.  250.1000 
through 250.1008.
    (2) A pipeline right-of-way grant holder must identify in writing to 
the Regional Supervisor the operator of any pipeline located on its 
right-of-way, if the operator is different from the right-of-way grant 
holder.
    (3) A producing operator must identify for its own records, on all 
existing pipelines located on its lease or right-of-way, the specific 
points at which operating responsibility transfers to a transporting 
operator.
    (i) Each producing operator must, if practical, durably mark all of 
its above-water transfer points by April 14, 1999 or the date a pipeline 
begins service, whichever is later.
    (ii) If it is not practical to durably mark a transfer point, and 
the transfer point is located above water, then the operator must 
identify the transfer point on a schematic located on the facility.
    (iii) If a transfer point is located below water, then the operator 
must identify the transfer point on a schematic and provide the 
schematic to MMS upon request.
    (iv) If adjoining producing and transporting operators cannot agree 
on a transfer point by April 14, 1999, the MMS Regional Supervisor and 
the Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 
Regional Director may jointly determine the transfer point.
    (4) The transfer point serves as a regulatory boundary. An operator 
may write to the MMS Regional Supervisor to request an exception to this 
requirement for an individual facility or area. The Regional Supervisor, 
in consultation with the OPS Regional Director and affected parties, may 
grant the request.
    (5) Pipeline segments designed, constructed, maintained, and 
operated under DOT regulations but transferring to DOI regulation as of 
October 16, 1998, may continue to operate under DOT design and 
construction requirements until significant modifications or repairs are 
made to those segments. After October 16, 1998, MMS operational and 
maintenance requirements will apply to those segments.
    (6) Any producer operating a pipeline that crosses into State waters 
without first connecting to a transporting operator's facility on the 
OCS must comply with this subpart. Compliance must extend from the point 
where hydrocarbons are first produced, through and including the last 
valve and associated safety equipment (e.g., pressure safety sensors) on 
the last production facility on the OCS.
    (7) Any producer operating a pipeline that connects facilities on 
the OCS must comply with this subpart.
    (8) Any operator of a pipeline that has a valve on the OCS 
downstream (landward) of the last production facility may ask in writing 
that the MMS Regional Supervisor recognize that valve as the last point 
MMS will exercise its regulatory authority.
    (9) A pipeline segment is not subject to MMS regulations for design, 
construction, operation, and maintenance if:
    (i) It is downstream (generally shoreward) of the last valve and 
associated safety equipment on the last production facility on the OCS; 
and
    (ii) It is subject to regulation under 49 CFR parts 192 and 195.
    (10) DOT may inspect all upstream safety equipment (including 
valves, over-pressure protection devices, cathodic protection equipment, 
and pigging devices, etc.) that serve to protect the integrity of DOT-
regulated pipeline segments.
    (11) OCS pipeline segments not subject to DOT regulation under 49 
CFR parts 192 and 195 are subject to all MMS regulations.
    (12) A producer may request that its pipeline operate under DOT 
regulations

[[Page 396]]

governing pipeline design, construction, operation, and maintenance.
    (i) The operator's request must be in the form of a written petition 
to the MMS Regional Supervisor that states the justification for the 
pipeline to operate under DOT regulation.
    (ii) The Regional Supervisor will decide, on a case-by-case basis, 
whether to grant the operator's request. In considering each petition, 
the Regional Supervisor will consult with the Office of Pipeline Safety 
(OPS) Regional Director.
    (13) A transporter who operates a pipeline regulated by DOT may 
request to operate under MMS regulations governing pipeline operation 
and maintenance. Any subsequent repairs or modifications will also be 
subject to MMS regulations governing design and construction.
    (i) The operator's request must be in the form of a written petition 
to the OPS Regional Director and the MMS Regional Supervisor.
    (ii) The MMS Regional Supervisor and the OPS Regional Director will 
decide how to act on this petition.
    (d) A pipeline which qualifies as a right-of-way pipeline (see Sec. 
250.1001, Definitions) shall not be installed until a right-of-way has 
been requested and granted in accordance with this subpart.
    (e)(1) The Regional Supervisor may suspend any pipeline operation 
upon a determination by the Regional Supervisor that continued activity 
would threaten or result in serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, 
mineral deposits, or the marine, coastal, or human environment.
    (2) The Regional Supervisor may also suspend pipeline operations or 
a right-of-way grant if the Regional Supervisor determines that the 
lessee or right-of-way holder has failed to comply with a provision of 
the Act or any other applicable law, a provision of these or other 
applicable regulations, or a condition of a permit or right-of-way 
grant.
    (3) The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) may cancel a pipeline 
permit or right-of-way grant in accordance with 43 U.S.C. 1334(a)(2). A 
right-of-way grant may be forfeited in accordance with 43 U.S.C. 
1334(e).

Sec. 250.1003  Installation, testing, and repair requirements for DOI 
pipelines.

    (a)(1) Pipelines greater than 8-5/8 inches in diameter and installed 
in water depths of less than 200 feet shall be buried to a depth of at 
least 3 feet unless they are located in pipeline congested areas or 
seismically active areas as determined by the Regional Supervisor. 
Nevertheless, the Regional Supervisor may require burial of any pipeline 
if the Regional Supervisor determines that such burial will reduce the 
likelihood of environmental degradation or that the pipeline may 
constitute a hazard to trawling operations or other uses. A trawl test 
or diver survey may be required to determine whether or not pipeline 
burial is necessary or to determine whether a pipeline has been properly 
buried.
    (2) Pipeline valves, taps, tie-ins, capped lines, and repaired 
sections that could be obstructive shall be provided with at least 3 
feet of cover unless the Regional Supervisor determines that such items 
present no hazard to trawling or other operations. A protective device 
may be used to cover an obstruction in lieu of burial if it is approved 
by the Regional Supervisor prior to installation.
    (3) Pipelines shall be installed with a minimum separation of 18 
inches at pipeline crossings and from obstructions.
    (4) Pipeline risers installed after April 1, 1988, shall be 
protected from physical damage that could result from contact with 
floating vessels. Riser protection on pipelines installed on or before 
April 1, 1988, may be required when the Regional Supervisor determines 
that significant damage potential exists.
    (b)(1) Pipelines shall be hydrostatically tested with water at a 
stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at least 8 hours 
when installed, relocated, uprated, or reactivated after being out-of-
service for more than 1 year.
    (2) Prior to returning a pipeline to service after a repair, the 
pipeline shall be pressure tested with water or processed natural gas at 
a minimum stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at 
least 2 hours.
    (3) Pipelines shall not be pressure tested at a pressure which 
produces a stress in the pipeline in excess of 95 percent of the 
specified minimum-yield strength of the pipeline. A temperature recorder 
measuring test fluid temperature synchronized with a pressure recorder 
along with deadweight test readings shall be employed for all pressure 
testing. When a pipeline is pressure tested, no observable leakage shall

[[Page 399]]

be allowed. Pressure gauges and recorders shall be of sufficient 
accuracy to verify that leakage is not occurring.
    (4) The Regional Supervisor may require pressure testing of 
pipelines to verify the integrity of the system when the Regional 
Supervisor determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the 
line has been damaged or weakened by external or internal conditions.
    (c) When a pipeline is repaired utilizing a clamp, the clamp shall 
be a full encirclement clamp able to withstand the anticipated pipeline 
pressure.

flow safety valve (FSV).
    (ii) For sulphur operations, incoming pipelines delivering gas to 
the power plant platform may be equipped with high- and low-pressure 
sensors (PSHL), which activate audible and visual alarms in lieu of 
requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The PSHL shall be 
set at 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above and below the 
normal operating pressure range.
    (2) Incoming pipelines boarding to a production platform shall be 
equipped with an automatic shutdown valve (SDV) immediately upon 
boarding the platform. The SDV shall be connected to the automatic- and 
remote-emergency shut-in systems.
    (3) Departing pipelines receiving production from production 
facilities shall be protected by high- and low-pressure sensors (PSHL) 
to directly or indirectly shut in all production facilities. The PSHL 
shall be set not to exceed 15 percent above and below the normal 
operating pressure range. However, high pilots shall not be set above 
the pipeline's MAOP.
    (4) Crossing pipelines on production or manned nonproduction 
platforms which do not receive production from the platform shall be 
equipped with an SDV immediately upon boarding the platform. The SDV 
shall be operated by a PSHL on the departing pipelines and connected to 
the platform automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.
    (5) The Regional Supervisor may require that oil pipelines be 
equipped with a metering system to provide a continuous volumetric 
comparison between the input to the line at the structure(s) and the 
deliveries onshore. The system shall include an alarm system and shall 
be of adequate sensitivity to detect variations between input and 
discharge volumes. In lieu of the foregoing, a system capable of 
detecting leaks in the pipeline may be substituted with the approval of 
the Regional Supervisor.
    (6) Pipelines incoming to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with a 
block valve and an FSV. Bidirectional pipelines connected to a subsea 
tie-in shall be equipped with only a block valve.
    (7) Gas-lift or water-injection pipelines on unmanned platforms need 
only be equipped with an FSV installed immediately upstream of each 
casing annulus or the first inlet valve on the christmas tree.
    (8) Bidirectional pipelines shall be equipped with a PSHL and an SDV 
immediately upon boarding each platform.
    (9) Pipeline pumps must comply with section A7 of API RP 14C 
(incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 250.198). The setting 
levels for the PSHL devices are specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) If the required safety equipment is rendered ineffective or 
removed from service on pipelines which are continued in operation, an 
equivalent degree of safety shall be provided. The safety equipment 
shall be identified by the placement of a sign on the equipment stating 
that the equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service.

Sec. 250.1016  Granting pipeline rights-of-way.

    (a) In considering an application for a right-of-way, the Regional 
Supervisor shall consider the potential effect of the associated 
pipeline on the human, marine, and coastal environments, life (including 
aquatic life), property, and mineral resources in the entire area during 
construction and operational phases. The Regional Supervisor shall 
prepare an environmental analysis in accordance with applicable policies 
and guidelines. To aid in the evaluation and determinations, the 
Regional Supervisor may request and consider

[[Page 406]]

views and recommendations of appropriate Federal Agencies, hold public 
meetings after appropriate notice, and consult, as appropriate, with 
State agencies, organizations, industries, and individuals. Before 
granting a pipeline right-of-way, the Regional Supervisor shall give 
consideration to any recommendation by the intergovernmental planning 
program, or similar process, for the assessment and management of OCS 
oil and gas transportation.
    (b) Should the proposed route of a right-of-way adjoin and 
subsequently cross any State submerged lands, the applicant shall submit 
evidence to the Regional Supervisor that the State(s) so affected has 
reviewed the application. The applicant shall also submit any comment 
received as a result of that review. In the event of a State 
recommendation to relocate the proposed route, the Regional Supervisor 
may consult with the appropriate State officials.
    (c)(1) The applicant shall submit photocopies of return receipts to 
the Regional Supervisor that indicate the date that each lessee or 
right-of-way holder referenced in Sec. 250.1010(c) of this part has 
received a copy of the application. Letters of no objection may be 
submitted in lieu of the return receipts.
    (2) The Regional Supervisor shall not take final action on a right-
of-way application until the Regional Supervisor is satisfied that each 
such lessee or right-of-way holder has been afforded at least 30 days 
from the date determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in which to 
submit comments.
    (d) If a proposed right-of-way crosses any lands not subject to 
disposition by mineral leasing or restricted from oil and gas 
activities, it shall be rejected by the Regional Supervisor unless the 
Federal Agency with jurisdiction over such excluded or restricted area 
gives its consent to the granting of the right-of-way. In such case, the 
applicant, upon a request filed within 30 days after receipt of the 
notification of such rejection, shall be allowed an opportunity to 
eliminate the conflict.
    (e)(1) If the application and other required information are found 
to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the right-of-
way may be granted. The Regional Supervisor may prescribe, as conditions 
to the right-of-way grant, stipulations necessary to protect human, 
marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), 
property, and mineral resources located on or adjacent to the right-of-
way.
    (2) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a change in the 
application should be made, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the 
applicant that an amended application shall be filed subject to 
stipulated changes. The Regional Supervisor shall determine whether the 
applicant shall deliver copies of the amended application to other 
parties for comment.
    (3) A decision to reject an application shall be in writing and 
shall state the reasons for the rejection.

grants.

    (a) Failure to construct the associated right-of-way pipeline within 
5 years of the date of the granting of a right-of-way shall cause the 
grant to expire.
    (b)(1) A right-of-way holder shall ensure that the right-of-way 
pipeline is constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the 
right-of-way as granted.
    (2) If, after constructing the right-of-way pipeline, it is 
determined that a deviation from the proposed right-of-way as granted 
has occurred, the right-of-way holder shall--
    (i) Notify the operators of all leases and holders of all right-of-
way grants in which a deviation has occurred, and within 60 days of the 
date of the acceptance by the Regional Supervisor of the completion of 
pipeline construction report, provide the Regional Supervisor with 
evidence of such notification; and
    (ii) Relinquish any unused portion of the right-of-way.
    (3) Substantial deviation of a right-of-way pipeline as constructed 
from the proposed right-of-way as granted may

[[Page 407]]

be grounds for forfeiture of the right-of-way.
    (c) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a significant change 
in conditions has occurred subsequent to the granting of a right-of-way 
but prior to the commencement of construction of the associated 
pipeline, the Regional Supervisor may suspend or temporarily prohibit 
the commencement of construction until the right-of-way grant is 
modified to the extent necessary to address the changed conditions.

                 Subpart K_Oil and Gas Production Rates


<R05>
Sec. 250.1100  Definitions for production rates.

    Terms used in this subpart shall have meanings given below:
    Enhanced recovery operations means pressure maintenance operations, 
secondary and tertiary recovery, cycling, and similar recovery 
operations which alter the natural forces in a reservoir to increase the 
ultimate recovery of oil or gas.
    Gas reservoir means a reservoir that contains hydrocarbons 
predominantly in a gaseous (single-phase) state.
    Gas-well completion means a well completed in a gas reservoir or in 
the gas cap of an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap.
    Maximum Efficient Rate (MER) means the maximum sustainable daily oil 
or gas withdrawal rate from a reservoir which will permit economic 
development and depletion of that reservoir without detriment to 
ultimate recovery.
    Maximum Production Rate (MPR) means the approved maximum daily rate 
at which oil or gas may be produced from a specified oil-well or gas-
well completion.
    Nonsensitive reservoir means a reservoir in which ultimate recovery 
is not decreased by high reservoir production rates.

[[Page 408]]

    Oil reservoir means a reservoir that contains hydrocarbons 
predominantly in a liquid (single-phase) state.
    Oil reservoir with an associated gas cap means a reservoir that 
contains hydrocarbons in both a liquid and gaseous (two-phase) state.
    Oil-well completion means a well completed in an oil reservoir or in 
the oil accumulation of an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap.
    Sensitive reservoir means a reservoir in which ultimate recovery is 
decreased by high reservoir production rates. A high reservoir 
production rate is one which exceeds the MER.
    Waste of oil and gas means: (1) The physical waste of oil and gas; 
(2) the inefficient, excessive, or improper use of, or the unnecessary 
dissipation of reservoir energy; (3) the locating, spacing, drilling, 
equipping, operating, or producing of any oil or gas well(s) in a manner 
which causes or tends to cause a reduction in the quantity of oil or gas 
ultimately recoverable from a pool under prudent and proper operations 
or which causes or tends to cause unnecessary or excessive surface loss 
or destruction of oil or gas; or (4) the inefficient storage of oil.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1101  General requirements and classification of reservoirs.

    (a) Wells and reservoirs shall be produced at rates that will 
provide economic development and depletion of the hydrocarbon resources 
in a manner that would maximize the ultimate recovery without adversely 
affecting correlative rights.
    (b) For directionally drilled wells in which the completed interval 
is closer than 500 feet from a unit or lease line or for vertically 
drilled wells in which the surface location is closer than 500 feet from 
a unit or lease line, for which the unit, lease, or royalty interests 
are not the same, the prior approval by the Regional Supervisor is 
required before production is commenced. An operator requesting such an 
approval shall furnish the Regional Supervisor with letters expressing 
acceptance or objection from operators of offset properties.
    (c) The lessee shall propose a classification for each reservoir as 
an oil reservoir, an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap or a gas 
reservoir, and as sensitive or nonsensitive.
    (d) All oil reservoirs with associated gas caps shall be initially 
classified as sensitive and shall require establishing a maximum 
efficient production rate and balancing of production in accordance with 
Sec. 250.1102(a) (1) and (5) of this part. All other oil reservoirs and 
all gas reservoirs shall be initially classified as nonsensitive.
    (e) A reservoir may be reclassified by the Minerals Management 
Service (MMS) as to type and sensitivity at any time during its 
productive life when information becomes available showing that 
reclassification is warranted.
    (f) The lessee must pay the service fee listed in Sec. 250.125 of 
this part with its request for either a 500 feet from lease/unit line 
production interval or to produce from a completion in an associated gas 
cap of a sensitive reservoir under this section.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1102  Oil and gas production rates.

    (a) MER. (1) The lessee shall submit a proposed MER for each 
producing sensitive reservoir on Form MMS-127, Request for Reservoir 
Maximum Efficient Rate (MER), along with appropriate supporting 
information to the Regional Supervisor within 45 days after discovering 
that a reservoir is sensitive.
    (2) The lessee may propose to revise an MER by submitting Form MMS-
127 with appropriate supporting information.
    (3) The effective date of an MER for a reservoir or revision thereof 
shall be the first day of the month in which Form MMS-127 is submitted.
    (4) When approved, the MER shall not be exceeded, except as provided 
in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (5) If a reservoir is produced at a rate in excess of the MER for 
any month, the lessee should initiate measures necessary to balance 
production (offset overproduction by underproduction) during the next 
succeeding month. All overproduction shall be balanced by the end of the 
next succeeding calendar quarter following the quarter in which

[[Page 409]]

the overproduction occurred. Any operation in an overproduction status 
in any reservoir for two successive calendar quarters shall be shut in 
from that reservoir until the actual production is equal to that which 
would have occurred under the approved MER, unless an alternative plan 
is approved by the Regional Supervisor.
    (6) The lessee shall review the MER for each producing sensitive 
reservoir at least once a year and submit Form MMS-127 with appropriate 
supporting information.
    (7) The lessee may request the reclassification of a reservoir from 
sensitive to nonsensitive and request approval for termination of an MER 
by submitting Form MMS-127 with information supporting the 
reclassification and termination.
    (8) At the request of the Regional Supervisor, the lessee shall 
furnish the information specified on Form MMS-127 for any producing 
nonsensitive reservoir.
    (9) Public information copies of Form MMS-127 shall be submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 250.190.
    (b) MPR. (1) The lessee shall propose an MPR for each producing well 
completion together with full information on the method used in its 
determination. The MPR shall be based on well tests and any limitations 
imposed by well and surface equipment, sand production, gas-oil and 
water-oil ratios, location of perforated intervals, and prudent 
operating practices. The sum of the MPR's of wells completed in a 
sensitive reservoir shall not exceed the approved MER.
    (2) The lessee shall conduct a well-flow potential test within 30 
days of the date of first continuous production on all new, recompleted, 
and reworked well completions. Within 15 days after the end of the test 
period, the lessee must submit a proposed MPR with well potential test 
for the individual well completion on Form MMS-126, Well Potential Test 
Report. The initial MPR shall not exceed 110 percent of the test rate 
submitted and shall be effective on the first day of the month following 
the end of the test period if approved by the Regional Supervisor. 
During the 30-day period allowed for testing, the lessee may produce a 
new, recompleted, or reworked completion at rates necessary to establish 
the MPR. After the 30-day period and prior to approval of the initial 
MPR, a well completion may be produced at a rate not to exceed the 
proposed rate. The lessee shall report the total production obtained 
during the test period and shall identify all other wells completed in 
the reservoir on Form MMS-126.
    (3) At least one well test shall be conducted during a calendar half 
for producing oil-well and gas-well completions and results submitted on 
Form MMS-128, Semiannual Well Test Report. Well tests shall be submitted 
within 45 days of the day the test was conducted.
    (4) Unless otherwise ordered by the Regional Supervisor, a revised 
MPR shall automatically be approved for each well completion for each 
well test submitted equal to 110 percent of the test rate. The revised 
MPR will be effective on the first day of the month following the date 
the well test was conducted. Prior to the approval of a proposed 
increase of the MPR, a well completion may be produced at a rate not to 
exceed the proposed increased rate.
    (5) When a well test is not submitted during a calendar half for a 
producing oil-well or gas-well completion, the MPR will be automatically 
canceled effective on the first day of the appropriate following 
calendar half.
    (6) When the results of a semiannual well test for an oil-well or 
gas-well completion cannot be submitted within the specified time, the 
lessee shall request an extension of time for submitting those test 
results. The extension must be approved in advance by the Regional 
Supervisor to continue production under the last approved MPR.
    (7) When approved by the Regional Supervisor, an MPR shall not be 
exceeded, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (c) of this 
section.
    (8) Public Information copies of Form MMS-126 shall be submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 250.190.
    (9) Public information copies of Form MMS-128 shall be submitted in 
accordance with Sec. 250.190.
    (c) Temporary rates. Temporary production rates resulting from 
normal variations and fluctuations exceeding a

[[Page 410]]

well MPR or reservoir MER shall not be considered a violation, provided 
that such production in excess of an approved MER is balanced by 
production in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this 
section.

Sec. 250.1103  Well production testing.

    (a) The required well testing shall be conducted for a period of not 
less than four consecutive hours. Immediately prior to the 4-hour test 
period, the well completion shall have produced under stabilized 
conditions for a period of not less than six consecutive hours. The 6-
hour pretest period shall not begin until after the recovery of a volume 
of fluid equivalent to the amount of fluids introduced into the 
formation during completion, recompletion, reworking, or treatment 
operations. Measured gas volumes shall be adjusted to the standard 
conditions of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) (15.025 psia 
in the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region) and 60 [deg]F for all tests. When 
orifice meters are used, a specific gravity for the gas shall be 
obtained or estimated, and a specific gravity-correction factor shall be 
applied to the orifice coefficient. The Regional Supervisor may require 
a prolonged test or retest of a well completion if the test is 
determined to be necessary for the establishment of a well MPR or a 
reservoir MER. The Regional Supervisor may approve test periods of less 
than 4 hours and pretest stabilization periods of less than 6 hours for 
well completions provided that test reliability can be demonstrated 
under such procedures.
    (b) At the request of the Regional Supervisor, the lessee shall 
conduct a multipoint back-pressure test to determine the theoretical 
open-flow potential of a gas well. The test shall be conducted within 30 
days of the Regional Supervisor's request or within the time period 
specified by the Regional Supervisor.
    (c) An MMS representative may witness any well test of oil-well and 
gas-well completions. Upon request, a lessee shall provide advance 
notice to the Regional Supervisor of the time and date of well tests.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1104  Bottomhole pressure survey.

    (a) For each new reservoir, the lessee shall conduct a static 
bottomhole pressure survey within 3 months after the date of first 
continuous production.
    (b) For each producing reservoir with three or more producing 
completions, the lessee shall conduct annual static bottomhole pressure 
surveys in a sufficient number of key wells to establish an average 
reservoir pressure. The Regional Supervisor may require that a survey be 
performed on specific wells.
    (c) The results of all static bottomhole pressure surveys obtained 
by the lessee shall be filed with the Regional Supervisor within 60 days 
after the date of the survey.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1105  Flaring or venting gas and burning liquid hydrocarbons.

    (a) Lessees may flare or vent oil-well gas or gas-well gas without 
receiving prior approval from the Regional Supervisor only in the 
following situations:
    (1) When gas vapors are flared or vented in small volumes from 
storage vessels or other low-pressure production vessels and cannot be 
economically recovered.
    (2) During an equipment failure or to relieve system pressures. The 
lessee must comply with the following conditions:
    (i) Lessees must not flare or vent oil-well gas for more than 48 
continuous hours unless the Regional Supervisor approves. The Regional 
Supervisor may specify a limit of less than 48 hours to prevent air 
quality degradation.
    (ii) Lessees must not flare or vent gas from a facility for more 
than 144 cumulative hours during any calendar month unless the Regional 
Supervisor approves.
    (iii) Lessees must not flare or vent gas-well gas beyond the time 
required to eliminate an emergency unless the Regional Supervisor 
approves.

[[Page 411]]

    (3) During the unloading or cleaning of a well, drill-stem testing, 
production testing, or other well-evaluation testing. Flaring or venting 
must not exceed 48 cumulative hours per testing operation on a single 
completion. The Regional Supervisor may allow less time to prevent air 
quality degradation or more time if lessees need additional time to 
evaluate reservoir parameters.
    (b) Lessees may flare or vent oil-well gas for up to 1 year when the 
Regional Supervisor approves the request for one of the following 
reasons:
    (1) The lessee initiated an action which, when completed, will 
eliminate flaring and venting; or
    (2) The lessee submitted an evaluation supported by engineering, 
geologic, and economic data indicating that either:
    (i) The oil and gas produced from the well(s) will not economically 
support the facilities necessary to save and/or sell the gas; or
    (ii) There is not enough gas to market.
    (c) Lessees may burn produced liquid hydrocarbons only if the 
Regional Supervisor approves. To burn produced liquid hydrocarbons, the 
lessee must demonstrate that the amounts to burn would be minimal, or 
that the alternatives are infeasible or pose a significant risk that may 
harm offshore personnel or the environment. Alternatives to burning 
liquid hydrocarbons include transporting the liquids or storing and re-
injecting them into a producible zone.
    (d) Lessees must prepare records detailing gas flaring or venting 
and liquid hydrocarbon burning for each facility. The records must 
include, at a minimum:
    (1) Daily volumes of gas flared or vented and liquid hydrocarbons 
burned;
    (2) Number of hours of flaring, venting, or burning on a daily 
basis;
    (3) Reasons for flaring, venting, or burning; and
    (4) A list of the wells contributing to flaring, venting, or 
burning, along with the gas-oil ratio data.
    (e) Lessees must keep these records for at least 2 years. Lessees 
must allow Minerals Management Service representatives to inspect the 
records at the lessees' field office that is nearest the Outer 
Continental Shelf facility, or at another location agreed to by the 
Regional Supervisor. If the Regional Supervisor requests to see the 
records, lessees must provide a copy.
    (f) Requirements for flaring and venting of gas containing 
H<INF>2</INF>S--(1) Flaring of gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S. (i) The 
Regional Supervisor may, for safety or air pollution prevention 
purposes, further restrict the flaring of gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S. 
The Regional Supervisor will use information provided in the lessee's 
H<INF>2</INF>S Contingency Plan (Sec. 250.490(f)), Exploration Plan or 
Development and Production Plan, and associated documents in determining 
the need for such restrictions.
    (ii) If the Regional Supervisor determines that flaring at a 
facility or group of facilities may significantly affect the air quality 
of an onshore area, the Regional Supervisor may require the operator(s) 
to conduct an air quality modeling analysis to determine the potential 
effect of facility emissions on onshore ambient concentrations of 
SO<INF>2</INF>. The Regional Supervisor may require monitoring and 
reporting or may restrict or prohibit flaring pursuant to Sec. Sec. 
250.303 and 250.304.
    (2) Venting of gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S. You must not vent gas 
containing H<INF>2</INF>S except for minor releases during maintenance 
and repair activities that do not result in a 15-minute time weighted 
average atmospheric concentration of H<INF>2</INF>S of 20 ppm or higher 
anywhere on the platform.
    (3) Reporting flared gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S. In addition to 
the recordkeeping requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this 
section, when required by the Regional Supervisor, the operator must 
submit to the Regional Supervisor a monthly report of flared and vented 
gas containing H<INF>2</INF>S. The report must contain the following 
information:
    (i) On a daily basis, the volume and duration of each flaring 
episode;
    (ii) H<INF>2</INF>S concentration in the flared gas; and
    (iii) Calculated amount of SO<INF>2</INF> emitted.

monthly, but the time between meter factor determinations must not 
exceed 42 days;
    (4) Obtain approval from the Regional Supervisor before proving on a 
schedule other than monthly; and
    (5) Submit copies of all meter proving reports for royalty meters to 
the Regional Supervisor monthly within 15 days after the end of the 
month.
    (e) What are the requirements for calibrating a master meter used in 
royalty meter provings? You must:
    (1) Calibrate the master meter to obtain a master meter factor 
before using it to determine operating meter factors;
    (2) Use a fluid of similar gravity, viscosity, temperature, and flow 
rate as the liquid hydrocarbons that flow through the operating meter to

accepted runs to compute the meter factor.

[[Page 416]]

    (2) If you use a master meter, you must record proof runs until 
three consecutive runs produce a total meter factor difference of no 
greater than 0.0005. The flow rate through the meters during the proving 
must be within 10 percent of the rate at which the line meter will 
operate. The final meter factor is determined by averaging the meter 
factors of the three runs;
    (3) If you use a tank prover, you must record proof runs until two 
consecutive runs produce a meter factor difference of no greater than 
.0005. The final meter factor is determined by averaging the meter 
factors of the two runs; and
    (4) You must apply operating meter factors forward starting with the 
date of the proving.
    (i) Under what circumstances does a liquid hydrocarbon royalty meter 
need to be taken out of service, and what must I do? (1) If the 
difference between the meter factor and the previous factor exceeds 
0.0025 it is a malfunction factor, and you must:
    (i) Remove the meter from service and inspect it for damage or wear;
    (ii) Adjust or repair the meter, and reprove it;
    (iii) Apply the average of the malfunction factor and the previous 
factor to the production measured through the meter between the date of 
the previous factor and the date of the malfunction factor; and
    (iv) Indicate that a meter malfunction occurred and show all 
appropriate remarks regarding subsequent repairs or adjustments on the 
proving report.
    (2) If a meter fails to register production, you must:
    (i) Remove the meter from service, repair and reprove it;
    (ii) Apply the previous meter factor to the production run between 
the date of that factor and the date of the failure; and
    (iii) Estimate and report unregistered production on the run ticket.
    (3) If the results of a royalty meter proving exceed the run 
tolerance criteria and all measures excluding the adjustment or repair 
of the meter cannot bring results within tolerance, you must:
    (i) Establish a factor using proving results made before any 
adjustment or repair of the meter; and
    (ii) Treat the established factor like a malfunction factor (see 
paragraph (i)(1) of this section).
    (j) How must I correct gross liquid hydrocarbon volumes to standard 
conditions? To correct gross liquid hydrocarbon volumes to standard 
conditions, you must:
    (1) Include Cpl factors in the meter factor calculation or list and 
apply them on the appropriate run ticket.
    (2) List Ctl factors on the appropriate run ticket when the meter is 
not automatically temperature compensated.
    (k) What are the requirements for liquid hydrocarbon allocation

    Source: 62 FR 5331, Feb. 5, 1997, unless otherwise noted. 
Redesignated at 63 FR 29479, May 29, 1998.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1300  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart explains how Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases are 
unitized. If you are an OCS lessee, use the regulations in this subpart 
for both competitive reservoir and unitization situations. The purpose 
of joint development and unitization is to:
    (a) Conserve natural resources;
    (b) Prevent waste; and/or
    (c) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1301  What are the requirements for unitization?

    (a) Voluntary unitization. You and other OCS lessees may ask the 
Regional Supervisor to approve a request for voluntary unitization. The 
Regional Supervisor may approve the request for voluntary unitization if 
unitized operations:
    (1) Promote and expedite exploration and development; or
    (2) Prevent waste, conserve natural resources, or protect 
correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, of a reasonably 
delineated and productive reservoir.
    (b) Compulsory unitization. The Regional Supervisor may require you 
and other lessees to unitize operations if unitized operations are 
necessary to:
    (1) Prevent waste;
    (2) Conserve natural resources; or
    (3) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, 
of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir.
    (c) Unit area. The area that a unit includes is the minimum number 
of leases that will allow the lessees to minimize the number of 
platforms, facility installations, and wells necessary for efficient 
exploration, development, and production of mineral deposits, oil and 
gas reservoirs, or potential hydrocarbon accumulations. A unit may 
include whole leases or portions of leases.
    (d) Unit agreement. You, the other lessees, and the unit operator 
must enter into a unit agreement. The unit agreement must: allocate 
benefits to unitized leases, designate a unit operator, and specify the 
effective date of the unit agreement. The unit agreement must terminate 
when: the unit no longer produces unitized substances, and the unit 
operator no longer conducts drilling or well-workover operations (Sec. 
250.180) under the unit agreement, unless the Regional Supervisor orders 
or approves a suspension of production under Sec. 250.170.
    (e) Unit operating agreement. The unit operator and the owners of 
working interests in the unitized leases must enter into a unit 
operating agreement. The unit operating agreement must describe how all 
the unit participants will apportion all costs and liabilities incurred 
maintaining or conducting operations. When a unit involves one or more 
net-profit-share leases, the unit operating agreement must describe how 
to attribute costs and credits to the net-profit-share lease(s), and 
this part of the agreement must be approved by the Regional Supervisor. 
Otherwise, you must provide a copy of the unit operating agreement to 
the Regional Supervisor, but the Regional Supervisor does not need to 
approve the unit operating agreement.
    (f) Extension of a lease covered by unit operations. If your unit 
agreement expires or terminates, or the unit area adjusts so that no 
part of your lease remains within the unit boundaries, your lease 
expires unless:
    (1) Its initial term has not expired;
    (2) You conduct drilling, production, or well-reworking operations 
on your lease consistent with applicable regulations; or
    (3) MMS orders or approves a suspension of production or operations 
for your lease.
    (g) Unit operations. If your lease, or any part of your lease, is 
subject to a unit agreement, the entire lease continues for the term 
provided in the lease, and as long thereafter as any portion of your 
lease remains part of

[[Page 420]]

the unit area, and as long as operations continue the unit in effect.
    (1) If you drill, produce or perform well-workover operations on a 
lease within a unit, each lease, or part of a lease, in the unit will 
remain active in accordance with the unit agreement. Following a 
discovery, if your unit ceases drilling activities for a reasonable time 
period between the delineation of one or more reservoirs and the 
initiation of actual development drilling or production operations and 
that time period would extend beyond your lease's primary term or any 
extension under Sec. 250.180, the unit operator must request and obtain 
MMS approval of a suspension of production under Sec. 250.170 in order 
to keep the unit from terminating.
    (2) When a lease in a unit agreement is beyond the primary term and 
the lease or unit is not producing, the lease will expire unless:
    (i) You conduct a continuous drilling or well reworking program 
designed to develop or restore the lease or unit production; or
    (ii) MMS orders or approves a suspension of operations under Sec. 
250.170.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1302  What if I have a competitive reservoir on a lease?

    (a) The Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct development 
and production operations in a competitive reservoir under either a 
joint Development and Production Plan or a unitization agreement. A 
competitive reservoir has one or more producing or producible well 
completions on each of two or more leases, or portions of leases, with 
different lease operating interests. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
producible well completion is a well which is capable of production and 
which is shut in at the well head or at the surface but not necessarily 
connected to production facilities and from which the operator plans 
future production.
    (b) You may request that the Regional Supervisor make a preliminary 
determination whether a reservoir is competitive. When you receive the 
preliminary determination, you have 30 days (or longer if the Regional 
Supervisor allows additional time) to concur or to submit an objection 
with supporting evidence if you do not concur. The Regional Supervisor 
will make a final determination and notify you and the other lessees.
    (c) If you conduct drilling or production operations in a reservoir 
determined competitive by the Regional Supervisor, you and the other 
affected lessees must submit for approval a joint plan of operations. 
You must submit the joint plan within 90 days after the Regional 
Supervisor makes a final determination that the reservoir is 
competitive. The joint plan must provide for the development and/or 
production of the reservoir. You may submit supplemental plans for the 
Regional Supervisor's approval.
    (d) If you and the other affected lessees cannot reach an agreement 
on a joint Development and Production Plan within the approved period of 
time, each lessee must submit a separate plan to the Regional 
Supervisor. The Regional Supervisor will hold a hearing to resolve 
differences in the separate plans. If the differences in the separate 
plans are not resolved at the hearing and the Regional Supervisor 
determines that unitization is necessary under Sec. 250.1301(b), MMS 
will initiate unitization under Sec. 250.1304.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1303  How do I apply for voluntary unitization?

    (a) You must file a request for a voluntary unit with the Regional 
Supervisor. Your request must include:
    (1) A draft of the proposed unit agreement;
    (2) A proposed initial plan of operation;
    (3) Supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and
    (4) Other information that may be necessary to show that the 
unitization proposal meets the criteria of Sec. 250.1300.
    (b) The unit agreement must comply with the requirements of this 
part. MMS will maintain and provide a model unit agreement for you to 
follow. If MMS revises the model, MMS will publish the revised model in 
the Federal Register. If you vary your

[[Page 421]]

unit agreement from the model agreement, you must obtain the approval of 
the Regional Supervisor.
    (c) After the Regional Supervisor accepts your unitization proposal, 
you, the other lessees, and the unit operator must sign and file copies 
of the unit agreement, the unit operating agreement, and the initial 
plan of operation with the Regional Supervisor for approval.
    (d) You must pay the service fee listed in Sec. 250.125 of this 
part with your request for a voluntary unitization proposal or the 
expansion of a previously approved voluntary unit to include additional 
acreage. Additionally, you must pay the service fee listed in Sec. 
250.125 with your request for unitization revision.

<R05>
Sec. 250.1304  How will MMS require unitization?

    (a) If the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization of 
operations within a proposed unit area is necessary to prevent waste, 
conserve natural resources of the OCS, or protect correlative rights, 
including Federal royalty interests, the Regional Supervisor may require 
unitization.
    (b) If you ask MMS to require unitization, you must file a request 
with the Regional Supervisor. You must include a proposed unit agreement 
as described in Sec. Sec. 250.1301(d) and 250.1303(b); a proposed unit 
operating agreement; a proposed initial plan of operation; supporting 
geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and any other information 
that may be necessary to show that unitization meets the criteria of 
Sec. 250.1300. The proposed unit agreement must include a counterpart 
executed by each lessee seeking compulsory unitization. Lessees who seek 
compulsory unitization must simultaneously serve on the nonconsenting 
lessees copies of:
    (1) The request;
    (2) The proposed unit agreement with executed counterparts;
    (3) The proposed unit operating agreement; and
    (4) The proposed initial plan of operation.
    (c) If the Regional Supervisor initiates compulsory unitization, MMS 
will serve all lessees of the proposed unit area with a proposed 
unitization plan and a statement of reasons for the proposed 
unitization.
    (d) The Regional Supervisor will not require unitization until MMS 
provides all lessees of the proposed unit area written notice and an 
opportunity for a hearing. If you want MMS to hold a hearing, you must 
request it within 30 days after you receive written notice from the 
Regional Supervisor or after you are served with a request for 
compulsory unitization from another lessee.
    (e) MMS will not hold a hearing under this paragraph until at least 
30 days after MMS provides written notice of the hearing date to all 
parties owning interests that would be made subject to the unit 
agreement. The Regional Supervisor must give all lessees of the proposed 
unit area an opportunity to submit views orally and in writing and to 
question both those seeking and those opposing compulsory unitization. 
Adjudicatory procedures are not required. The Regional Supervisor will 
make a decision based upon a record of the hearing, including any 
written information made a part of the record. The Regional Supervisor 
will arrange for a court reporter to make a verbatim transcript. The 
party seeking compulsory unitization must pay for the court reporter and 
pay for and provide to the Regional Supervisor within 10 days after the 
hearing three copies of the verbatim transcript.
    (f) The Regional Supervisor will issue an order that requires or 
rejects compulsory unitization. That order must include a statement of 
reasons for the action taken and identify those parts of the record 
which form the basis of the decision. Any adversely affected party may 
appeal the final order of the Regional Supervisor under 30 CFR part 290.

    (a) When you receive the Reviewing Officer's final decision, you 
have 60 days to either pay the penalty or file an appeal in accordance 
with 30 CFR part 290, subpart A.
    (b) If you file an appeal, you must either:
    (1) Submit a surety bond in the amount of the penalty to the 
Regional Adjudication Office in the Region where the penalty was 
assessed, following instructions that the Reviewing Officer will include 
in the final decision; or
    (2) Notify the Regional Adjudication Office, in the Region where the 
penalty was assessed, that you want your lease-specific/area-wide bond 
on file to be used as the bond for the penalty amount.
    (c) If you choose the alternative in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the Regional Director may require additional security (i.e., 
security in excess of your existing bond) to ensure sufficient coverage 
during an appeal. In that event, the Regional Director will require you 
to post the supplemental bond with the regional office in the same 
manner as under Sec. Sec. 256.53(d) through (f) of this chapter. If the 
Regional Director determines the appeal should be covered by a lease-
specific abandonment account then you must establish an account that 
meets the requirements of Sec. 256.56.
    (d) If you do not either pay the penalty or file a timely appeal, 
MMS will take one or more of the following actions:
    (1) We will collect the amount you were assessed, plus interest, 
late payment charges, and other fees as provided by law, from the date 
you received the Reviewing Officer's final decision until the date we 
receive payment;
    (2) We may initiate additional enforcement, including, if 
appropriate, cancellation of the lease, right-of-way, license, permit, 
or approval, or the forfeiture of a bond under this part; or

intervals not exceeding 1,000 feet during the normal course of drilling. 
Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be 
obtained on all directionally drilled wells at intervals not exceeding 
500 feet during the normal course of drilling and at intervals not 
exceeding 200 feet in all planned angle-change portions of the borehole.
    (3) Directional surveys giving both inclination and azimuth shall be 
obtained on both vertically and directionally drilled wells at intervals 
not exceeding 500 feet prior to or upon setting a string of casing, or 
production liner, and at total depth. Composite directional surveys 
shall be prepared with the interval shown from the bottom of the 
conductor casing. In calculating all surveys, a correction from the true 
north to Universal-Transverse-Mercator-Grid-north or Lambert-Grid-north 
shall be made after making the magnetic-to-true-north correction. A 
composite dipmeter directional survey or a composite measurement while-
drilling directional survey will be acceptable as fulfilling the 
applicable requirements of this paragraph.
    (4) Wells are classified as vertical if the calculated average of 
inclination readings weighted by the respective interval lengths between 
readings from surface to drilled depth does not exceed 3 degrees from 
the vertical. When the calculated average inclination readings weighted 
by the length of the respective interval between readings from the 
surface to drilled depth exceeds 3 degrees, the well is classified as 
directional.
    (5) At the request of a holder of an adjoining lease, the Regional 
Supervisor may, for the protection of correlative rights, furnish a copy 
of the directional survey to that leaseholder.
    (f) Fixed drilling platforms. Applications for installation of fixed 
drilling platforms or structures including artificial islands shall be 
submitted in accordance with the provisions of subpart I, Platforms and 
Structures, of this part. Mobile drilling units that have their jacking

District Supervisor to determine specific operating requirements, field 
rules may be established for drilling, well completion, or well workover 
on the District Supervisor's initiative or in response to a request from 
a lessee; such rules may modify the specific requirements of this 
subpart. After field rules have been established, operations in the 
field shall be conducted in accordance with such rules and other 
requirements of this subpart. Field rules may be amended or canceled for 
cause at any time upon the initiative of the District Supervisor or upon 
the request of a lessee.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1608  Well casing and cementing.

    (a) General requirements. (1) For the purpose of this subpart, the 
several casing strings in order of normal installation are:
    (i) Drive or structural,
    (ii) Conductor,
    (iii) Cap rock casing,
    (iv) Bobtail cap rock casing (required when the cap rock casing does 
not penetrate into the cap rock),
    (v) Second cap rock casing (brine wells), and
    (vi) Production liner.
    (2) The lessee shall case and cement all wells with a sufficient 
number of strings of casing cemented in a manner necessary to prevent 
release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore (directly or 
indirectly) into the sea, protect freshwater aquifers from 
contamination, support unconsolidated sediments, and otherwise provide a 
means of control of the formation pressures and fluids. Cement 
composition, placement techniques, and waiting time shall be designed 
and conducted so that the cement in place behind the bottom 500 feet of 
casing or total length of annular cement fill, if less, attains a 
minimum compressive strength of 160 pounds per square inch (psi).
    (3) The lessee shall install casing designed to withstand the 
anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling 
loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations 
thereof. Safety factors in the drilling and casing program designs shall 
be of sufficient magnitude to provide well control during drilling and 
to assure safe operations for the life of the well.
    (4) In cases where cement has filled the annular space back to the 
mud line, the cement may be washed out or displaced to a depth not 
exceeding the depth of the structural casing shoe to facilitate casing 
removal upon well abandonment if the District Supervisor determines that 
subsurface protection against damage to freshwater aquifers and against 
damage caused by adverse loads, pressures, and fluid flows is not 
jeopardized.
    (5) If there are indications of inadequate cementing (such as lost 
returns,

[[Page 430]]

cement channeling, or mechanical failure of equipment), the lessee shall 
evaluate the adequacy of the cementing operations by pressure testing 
the casing shoe. If the test indicates inadequate cementing, the lessee 
shall initiate remedial action as approved by the District Supervisor. 
For cap rock casing, the test for adequacy of cementing shall be the 
pressure testing of the annulus between the cap rock and the conductor 
casings. The pressure shall not exceed 70 percent of the burst pressure 
of the conductor casing or 70 percent of the collapse pressure of the 
cap rock casing.
    (b) Drive or structural casing. This casing shall be set by driving, 
jetting, or drilling to a minimum depth of 100 feet below the mud line 
or such other depth, as may be required or approved by the District 
Supervisor, in order to support unconsolidated deposits and to provide 
hole stability for initial drilling operations. If this portion of the 
hole is drilled, a quantity of cement sufficient to fill the annular 
space back to the mud line shall be used.
    (c) Conductor and cap rock casing setting and cementing 
requirements. (1) Conductor and cap rock casing design and setting 
depths shall be based upon relevant engineering and geologic factors 
including the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, 
and water depths. The proposed casing setting depths may be varied, 
subject to District Supervisor approval, to permit the casing to be set 
in a competent formation or through formations determined desirable to 
be isolated from the wellbore by casing for safer drilling operations. 
However, the conductor casing shall be set immediately prior to drilling 
into formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon 
encountering such formations. Cap rock casing shall be set and cemented 
through formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon 
encountering such formations. Upon encountering unexpected formation 
pressures, the lessee shall submit a revised casing program to the 
District Supervisor for approval.
    (2) Conductor casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement 
that fills the calculated annular space back to the mud line. Cement 
fill shall be verified by the observation of cement returns. In the 
event that observation of cement returns is not feasible, additional 
quantities of cement shall be used to assure fill to the mud line.
    (3) Cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that 
fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet inside the 
conductor casing. When geologic conditions such as near surface 
fractures and faulting exist, cap rock casing shall be cemented with a 
quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to the mud 
line, unless otherwise approved by the District Supervisor. In brine 
wells, the second cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of 
cement that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet 
above the setting depth of the first cap rock casing.
    (d) Bobtail cap rock casing setting and cementing requirements. (1) 
Bobtail cap rock casing shall be set on or just in cap rock and lapped a 
minimum of 100 feet into the previous casing string.
    (2) Sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the 
top of the bobtail cap rock casing.
    (e) Production liner setting and cementing requirements. (1) 
Production liners for sulphur wells and bleedwells shall be set in cap 
rock at or above the bottom of the open hole (hole that is open in cap 
rock, below the bottom of the cap rock casing) and lapped into the 
previous casing string or to the surface. For brine wells, the liner 
shall be set in salt and lapped into the previous casing string or to 
the surface.

Sec. 250.1609  Pressure testing of casing.

    (a) Prior to drilling the plug after cementing, all casing strings, 
except the drive or structural casing, shall be pressure tested. The 
conductor casing shall be tested to at least 200 psi. All casing strings 
below the conductor casing shall be tested to 500 psi or 0.22 psi/ft, 
whichever is greater. (When oil or gas is not present in the cap rock, 
the production liner need not be cemented in place; thus, it would not 
be subject

[[Page 431]]

to pressure testing.) If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in 
30 minutes or if there is another indication of a leak, the casing shall 
be recemented, repaired, or an additional casing string run and the 
casing tested again. The above procedures shall be repeated until a 
satisfactory test is obtained. The time, conditions of testing, and 
results of all casing pressure tests shall be recorded in the driller's 
report.
    (b) After cementing any string of casing other than structural, 
drilling shall not be resumed until there has been a timelapse of at 
least 8 hours under pressure for the conductor casing string or 12 hours 
under pressure for all other casing strings. Cement is considered under 
pressure if one or more float valves are shown to be holding the cement 
in place or when other means of holding pressure are used.

gas, or sulphur production in paying quantities.


<R05>
Sec. 250.1712  What information must I submit before I permanently plug 
a well or zone?

    Before you permanently plug a well or zone, you must submit form 
MMS-124, Application for Permit to Modify, to the appropriate District 
Supervisor and receive approval. A request for approval must contain the 
following information:
    (a) The reason you are plugging the well (or zone), for completions 
with production amounts specified by the Regional Supervisor, along with 
substantiating information demonstrating its lack of capacity for 
further profitable production of oil, gas, or sulfur;
    (b) Recent well test data and pressure data, if available;
    (c) Maximum possible surface pressure, and how it was determined;
    (d) Type and weight of well-control fluid you will use;
    (e) A description of the work; and
    (f) A current and proposed well schematic and description that 
includes:
    (1) Well depth;
    (2) All perforated intervals that have not been plugged;
    (3) Casing and tubing depths and details;
    (4) Subsurface equipment;
    (5) Estimated tops of cement (and the basis of the estimate) in each 
casing annulus;
    (6) Plug locations;
    (7) Plug types;

Commerce makes the finding authorized by section 307(c)(3)(B)(iii) of 
the Coastal Zone Management Act.
    (5) Protecting archaeological resources. If the Regional Director 
believes that an archaeological resource may exist in the area that may 
be affected by drilling, the Regional Director will notify you of the 
need to prepare an archaeological report.
    (i) If the evidence suggests that an archaeological resource may be 
present, you must:
    (A) Locate the site of the drilling so as to not adversely affect 
the area where the archaeological resources may be, or
    (B) Establish to the satisfaction of the Regional Director that an 
archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely affected 
by drilling.

[[Page 462]]

This must be done by further archaeological investigation, conducted by 
an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using survey equipment and 
techniques deemed necessary by the Regional Director. A report on the 
investigation must be submitted to the Regional Director for review.
    (ii) If the Regional Director determines that an archaeological 
resource is likely to be present in the area that may be affected by 
drilling, and may be adversely affected by drilling, the Regional 
Director will notify you immediately. You must take no action that may 
adversely affect the archaeological resource unless further 
investigations determine that the resource is not archaeologically 
significant.
    (iii) If you discover any archaeological resource while drilling, 
you must immediately halt drilling and report the discovery to the 
Regional Director. If investigations determine that the resource is 
significant, the Regional Director will inform you how to protect it.
    (6) Application for permit to drill (APD). Before commencing deep 
stratigraphic test drilling activities under an approved drilling plan, 
you must submit an APD (Form MMS-123) and receive approval. You must 
comply with all regulations relating to drilling operations in 30 CFR 
part 250.
    (7) Revising an approved drilling plan. Before you revise an

approval.
    (8) After drilling. When you complete the test activities, you must 
permanently plug and abandon the boreholes of all deep stratigraphic 
tests in compliance with 30 CFR part 250. If the tract on which you 
conducted a deep stratigraphic test is leased to another party for 
exploration and development, and if the lessee has not disturbed the 
borehole, MMS will hold you and not the lessee responsible for problems 
associated with the test hole.
    (9) Deadline for completing a deep stratigraphic test. If your deep 
stratigraphic test well is within 50 geographic miles of a tract that 
MMS has identified for a future lease sale, as listed on the currently 
approved OCS leasing schedule, you must complete all drilling activities 
and submit the data and information to the Regional Director at least 60 
days before the first day of the month in which MMS schedules the lease 
sale. However, the Regional Director may extend your permit duration to 
allow you to complete drilling activities and submit data and 
information if the extension is in the national interest.
    (c) Group participation in test drilling. MMS encourages group 
participation for deep stratigraphic tests.
    (1) Purpose of group participation. The purpose is to minimize 
duplicative G&G activities involving drilling into the seabed of the 
OCS.
    (2) Providing opportunity for participation in a deep stratigraphic 
test. When you propose to drill a deep stratigraphic test, you must give 
all interested persons an opportunity to participate in the test 
drilling through a signed agreement on a cost-sharing basis. You may 
include a penalty for late participation of not more than 100 percent of 
the cost to each original participant in addition to the original share 
cost.
    (i) The participants must assess and distribute late participation 
penalties in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
    (ii) For a significant hydrocarbon occurrence that the Regional 
Director announces to the public, the penalty for subsequent late 
participants may be raised to not more than 300 percent of the cost of 
each original participant in addition to the original share cost.
    (3) Providing opportunity for participation in a shallow test 
drilling project. When you apply to conduct shallow test drilling 
activities, you must, if ordered by the Regional Director or required by 
the permit, give all interested persons an opportunity to participate in 
the test activity on a cost-sharing basis. You may include a penalty 
provision for late participation of not more than 50 percent of the cost 
to each original participant in addition to the original share cost.
    (4) Procedures for group participation in drilling activities. You 
must:
    (i) Publish a summary statement that describes the approved activity 
in a relevant trade publication;
    (ii) Forward a copy of the published statement to the Regional 
Director;

[[Page 463]]

    (iii) Allow at least 30 days from the summary statement publication 
date for other persons to join as original participants;
    (iv) Compute the estimated cost by dividing the estimated total cost 
of the program by the number of original participants; and
    (v) Furnish the Regional Director with a complete list of all 
participants before starting operations, or at the end of the 
advertising period if you begin operations before the advertising period 
is over. The names of any subsequent or late participants must also be 
furnished to the Regional Director.
    (5) Changes to the original application for test drilling. If you 
propose changes to the original application and the Regional Director 
determines that the changes are significant, the Regional Director will 
require you to publish the changes for an additional 30 days to give 
other persons a chance to join as original participants.
    (d) Bonding requirements. You must submit a bond under this part 
before you may start a deep stratigraphic test.
    (1) Before MMS issues a permit authorizing the drilling of a deep 
stratigraphic test, you must either:
    (i) Furnish to MMS a bond of not less than $200,000 that guarantees 
compliance with all the terms and conditions of the permit; or
    (ii) Maintain a $1 million bond that guarantees compliance with all 
the terms and conditions of the permit you hold for the OCS area where 
you propose to drill.
    (2) You must provide additional security to MMS if the Regional 
Director determines that it is necessary for the permit or area.
    (3) The Regional Director may require you to provide a bond, in an 
amount the Regional Director prescribes, before authorizing you to drill 
a shallow test well.
    (4) Your bond must be on a form approved by the Associate Director 
for Offshore Minerals Management.

Government or such State, as the case may be, may not raise as a defense 
any claim of sovereign immunity, or any claim that the employee who 
revealed the privileged or proprietary data or information which is the 
basis of such suit was acting outside the scope of the person's 
employment in revealing such data or information.
    (c) If the Director finds that any State cannot or does not comply 
with the conditions described in the agreement entered into pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Director shall thereafter withhold 
transmittal and deny access for inspection of privileged or proprietary 
data or information to such State until the Director finds that such 
State can and will comply with those conditions.

Sec. 253.5  What is the authority for collecting Oil Spill Financial 
Responsibility (OSFR) information?

    (a) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the 
information collection requirements in this part 253 under 44 U.S.C. 
3501 et seq. and assigned OMB control number 1010-0106.
    (b) MMS collects the information to ensure that the designated 
applicant for a COF has the financial resources necessary to pay for 
cleanup and damages that could be caused by oil discharges from the COF. 
MMS uses the information to ensure compliance of offshore lessees, 
owners, and operators of covered facilities with OPA; to establish 
eligibility of designated applicants for OSFR certification (OSFRC); and 
to establish a reference source of names, addresses, and telephone 
numbers of responsible parties for covered facilities and their 
designated agents, guarantors, and U.S. agents for service of process 
for claims associated with oil pollution from designated covered 
facilities. The requirement to provide the information is mandatory. No 
information submitted for OSFRC is confidential or proprietary.
    (c) An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.
    (d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of 
information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Minerals 
Management Service, Mail Stop 4230, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 
20240.

    (a) The following general parameters apply to the amount of OSFR 
that you must demonstrate:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you are the designated applicant for     Then you must demonstrate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only one COF..............................  The amount of OSFR that
                                             applies to the COF.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than one COF.........................  The highest amount of OSFR
                                             that applies to any one of
                                             the COFs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) You must demonstrate OSFR in the amounts specified in this 
section:
    (1) For a COF located wholly or partially in the OCS you must 
demonstrate OSFR in accordance with the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            Applicable
        COF worst case oil-spill discharge volume         amount of OSFR
------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 479]]

    (3) The Director may determine that you must demonstrate an amount 
of OSFR greater than the amount in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this 
section based on the relative operational, environmental, human health, 
and other risks that your COF poses. The Director may require an amount 
that is one or more levels higher than the amount indicated in paragraph 
(b)(1) or (2) of this section for your COF. The Director will not 
require an OSFR demonstration that exceeds $150 million.
    (4) You must demonstrate OSFR in the lowest amount specified in the 
applicable table in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) for a facility with a 
potential worst case oil-spill discharge of 1,000 bbls or less if the 
Director notifies you in writing that the demonstration is justified by 
the risks of the potential oil-spill discharge.


<R05>
Sec. 253.14  How do I determine the worst case oil-spill discharge 
volume?

    (a) To calculate the amount of OSFR you must demonstrate for a 
facility under Sec. 253.13(b), you must use the worst case oil-spill 
discharge volume that you determined under whichever of the following 
regulations applies:
    (1) 30 CFR Part 254--Response Plans for Facilities Located Seaward 
of the Coast Line, except that the volume of the worst case oil-spill 
discharge for a well must be four times the uncontrolled flow volume 
that you estimate for the first 24 hours.
    (2) 40 CFR Part 112--Oil Pollution Prevention; or
    (3) 49 CFR Part 194--Response Plans for Onshore Oil Pipelines.
    (b) If you are a designated applicant and you choose to demonstrate 
$150 million in OSFR, you are not required to determine any worst case 
oil-spill discharge volumes, since that is the maximum amount of OSFR 
required under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 253.15  What are my general OSFR compliance responsibilities?

    (a) You must maintain continuous OSFR coverage for all your leases, 
permits, and RUEs with COFs for which you are the designated applicant.
    (b) You must ensure that new OSFR evidence is submitted before your 
current evidence lapses or is canceled and that coverage for your new 
COF is submitted before the COF goes into operation.
    (c) If you use self-insurance to demonstrate OSFR and find that you 
no longer qualify to self-insure the required OSFR amount based upon 
your latest audited annual financial statements, then you must 
demonstrate OSFR using other methods acceptable to MMS by whichever of 
the following dates comes first:
    (1) Sixty calendar days after you receive your latest audited annual 
financial statement; or
    (2) The first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of your 
fiscal year.
    (d) You may use a surety bond to demonstrate OSFR. If you find that 
your bonding company has lost its state license or has had its U.S. 
Treasury Department certification revoked, then you must replace the 
surety bond within 15 calendar days using a method of OSFR that is 
acceptable to MMS.
    (e) You must notify MMS in writing within 15 calendar days after a 
change occurs that would prevent you from meeting your OSFR obligations 
(e.g., if you or your indemnitor petition for bankruptcy under Chapters 
7 or 11 of Title 11, U.S.C.). You must take any action MMS directs to 
ensure an acceptable OSFR demonstration.
    (f) If you deny payment of a claim presented to you under Sec. 
253.60, then you must give the claimant a written explanation for your 
denial.

international auditing standards that MMS determines to be equivalent.
    (c) The financial information you submit must be expressed in U.S. 
dollars. If this information was originally reported in another form of 
currency, you must convert it to U.S. dollars using the conversion 
factor that was effective on the last day of the fiscal year pertinent 
to your financial statements. You also must identify the source of the 
currency exchange rate.

<R05>
Sec. 253.26  What information must I submit to support my unencumbered 
assets demonstration?

    You must support your unencumbered assets evaluation with the 
information required by Sec. 253.23(a) and a list of reserved, 
unencumbered, and unimpaired U.S. assets whose value will not be 
affected by an oil discharge from a COF. The assets must be plant, 
property, or equipment held for use. You must submit a letter signed by 
your treasurer:
    (a) Identifying which assets are reserved;
    (b) Certifying that the assets are unencumbered, including 
contingent encumbrances;
    (c) Promising that the identified assets will not be sold, subjected 
to a security interest, or otherwise encumbered throughout the specified 
fiscal year; and
    (d) Specifying:
    (1) The State or the country of incorporation;
    (2) The total amount of the stockholders'/owners' equity listed on 
the balance sheet;
    (3) The identification and location of the reserved U.S. assets; and
    (4) The value of the reserved U.S. assets less accumulated 
depreciation and amortization, using the same valuation method used in 
your audited annual financial statement and expressed in U.S. dollars. 
The net value of the reserved assets must be at least two times the 
self-insurance amount requested for demonstration.


<R05>
Sec. 253.27  When I submit audited annual financial statements to verify 
my unencumbered assets, what standards must they meet?

    Any audited annual financial statements that you submit must:
    (a) Meet the standards in Sec. 253.24; and
    (b) Include a certification by the independent accountant who 
audited the financial statements that states:
    (1) The value of the unencumbered assets is reasonable and uses the 
same valuation method used in your audited annual financial statements;
    (2) Any existing encumbrances are noted;
    (3) The assets are long-term assets held for use; and
    (4) The valuation method used in the audited annual financial 
statements is for long-term assets held for use.


<R05>
Sec. 253.28  What financial test procedures must I use to evaluate the 
amount of self-insurance allowed as OSFR evidence based on unencumbered 
assets?

    (a) Divide the total amount of the stockholders'/owners' equity 
listed on the balance sheet by 4.
    (b) Divide the value of the unencumbered U.S. assets by 2.
    (c) The smaller number calculated under paragraphs (a) or (b) of 
this section is the maximum allowable amount you may use to demonstrate 
OSFR under this method.


<R05>
Sec. 253.29  How can I use insurance as OSFR evidence?

    (a) If you use insurance to satisfy all or part of your obligation 
to demonstrate OSFR, you may use only insurance certificates issued by 
insurers that have achieved a ``Secure'' rating for claims paying 
ability in their latest review by A.M. Best's Insurance Reports, 
Standard & Poor's Insurance Rating Services, or other equivalent rating 
made by a rating service acceptable to MMS.
    (b) You must submit information about your insurers to MMS on a 
completed and unaltered Form MMS-1019. The information you submit must:
    (1) Include all the information required by Sec. 253.41 and
    (2) Be executed on one original insurance certificate (i.e., Form 
MMS-1019) for each OSFR layer (see paragraph (c) of this section ), 
showing all participating insurers and their proportion (quota share) of 
this risk. The certificate must bear the original signatures of each 
insurer's underwriter or of their lead underwriters, underwriting 
managers, or delegated brokers, depending on who is authorized to bind 
the underwriter.
    (3) For each insurance company on the insurance certificate, 
indicate the insurer's claims-paying-ability rating and the rating 
service that issued the rating.
    (c) The insurance evidence you provide to MMS as OSFR evidence may 
be divided into layers, subject to the following restrictions:

[[Page 482]]

    (1) The total amount of OSFR evidence must equal the total amount 
you must demonstrate under Sec. 253.13;
    (2) No more than one insurance certificate may be used to cover each 
OSFR layer specified in Sec. 253.13(b) (i.e., four layers for an OCS 
COF, and five layers for a non-OCS COF);
    (3) You may use one insurance certificate to cover any number of 
consecutive OSFR layers;
    (4) Each insurer's participation in the covered insurance risk must 
be on a proportional (quota share) basis, must be expressed as a 
percentage of a whole layer, and the certificate must not contain 
intermediate, horizontal layers;
    (5) You may use an insurance deductible. If you use more than one 
insurance certificate, the deductible amount must apply only to the 
certificate that covers the base OSFR amount layer. To satisfy an 
insurance deductible, you may use only those methods that are acceptable 
as evidence of OSFR under this part; and
    (6) You must identify a U.S. agent for service of process on each 
insurance certificate you submit to MMS. The agent may be different for 
each insurance certificate.
    (d) You may submit to MMS a temporary insurance confirmation (fax 
binder) for each insurance certificate you use as OSFR evidence. Submit 
your fax binder on Form MMS-1019, and each form must include the 
signature of an underwriter for at least one of the participating 
insurers. MMS will accept your fax binder as OSFR evidence during a 
period that ends 90 days after the date that you need the insurance to 
demonstrate OSFR.


<R05>
Sec. 253.30  How can I use an indemnity as OSFR evidence?

    (a) You may use only one indemnity issued by only one indemnitor to 
satisfy all or part of your obligation to demonstrate OSFR.
    (b) Your indemnitor must be your corporate parent or affiliate.
    (c) Your indemnitor must complete a Form MMS-1018 and provide an 
indemnity that:
    (1) Includes all the information required by Sec. 253.41; and
    (2) Does not exceed the amounts calculated using the net worth or 
unencumbered assets tests specified under Sec. Sec. 253.21 through 
253.28.
    (d) You must submit your application to renew OSFR using an 
indemnity by the first calendar day of the 5th month after the close of 
your indemnitor's fiscal year. You may submit to MMS your initial 
application to demonstrate OSFR using an indemnity at any time.
    (e) Your indemnitor must identify a U.S. agent for service of 
process.


<R05>
Sec. 253.31  How can I use a surety bond as OSFR evidence?

    (a) Each bonding company that issues a surety bond that you submit 
to MMS as OSFR evidence must:
    (1) Be licensed to do business in the State in which the surety bond 
is executed;
    (2) Be certified by the U.S. Treasury Department as an acceptable 
surety for Federal obligations and listed in the current Treasury 
Circular No. 570;
    (3) Provide the surety bond on Form MMS-1020; and
    (4) Be in compliance with applicable statutes regulating surety 
company participation in insurance-type risks.
    (b) A surety bond that you submit as OSFR evidence must include all 
the information required by Sec. 253.41.


<R05>
Sec. 253.32  Are there alternative methods to demonstrate OSFR?

    The Director may accept other methods to demonstrate OSFR that 
provide equivalent assurance of timely satisfaction of claims. This may 
include pooling, letters of credit, pledges of treasury notes, or other 
comparable methods. Submit your proposal, together with all the 
supporting documents, to the Director at the address listed in Sec. 
253.45. The Director's decision whether to approve your alternative 
method to evidence OSFR is by this rule committed to the Director's sole 
discretion and is not subject to administrative appeal under 30 CFR part 
290 or 43 CFR part 4.


<R04>
         Subpart D_Requirements for Submitting OSFR Information


<R05>
Sec. 253.40  What OSFR evidence must I submit to MMS?

    (a) You must submit to MMS:

[[Page 483]]

    (1) A single demonstration of OSFR that covers all the COFs for 
which you are the designated applicant;
    (2) A completed and unaltered Form MMS-1016;
    (3) MMS forms that identify your COFs (Form MMS-1021, Form MMS-
1022), and the methods you will use to demonstrate OSFR (Form MMS-1018, 
Form MMS-1019, Form MMS-1020). Forms are available from the address 
listed in Sec. 253.45;
    (4) Any insurance certificates, indemnities, and surety bonds used 
as OSFR evidence for the COFs for which you are the designated 
applicant;
    (5) A completed Form MMS-1017 for each responsible party, unless you 
are the only responsible party for the COFs covered by your OSFR 
demonstration; and
    (6) Other financial instruments and information the Director 
requires to support your OSFR demonstration under Sec. 253.32.
    (b) Each MMS form you submit to MMS as part of your OSFR 
demonstration must be signed. You also must attach to Form MMS-1016 
proof of your authority to sign.


<R05>
Sec. 253.41  What terms must I include in my OSFR evidence?

    (a) Each instrument you submit as OSFR evidence must specify:
    (1) The effective date, and except for a surety bond, the expiration 
date;
    (2) That termination of the instrument will not affect the liability 
of the instrument issuer for claims arising from an incident (i.e., oil-
spill discharge or substantial threat of the discharge of oil) that 
occurred on or before the effective date of termination;
    (3) That the instrument will remain in force until the termination 
date or until the earlier of:
    (i) Thirty calendar days after MMS and the designated applicant 
receive from the instrument issuer a notification of intent to cancel; 
or
    (ii) MMS receives from the designated applicant other acceptable 
OSFR evidence; or
    (iii) All the COFs to which the instrument applies are permanently 
abandoned in compliance with 30 CFR part 250 or equivalent State 
requirements;
    (4) That the instrument issuer agrees to direct action for claims 
made under OPA up to the guaranty amount, subject to the defenses in 
paragraph (a)(6) of this section and following the procedures in Sec. 
253.60 of this part;
    (5) An agent in the United States for service of process; and
    (6) That the instrument issuer will not use any defenses against a 
claim made under OPA except:
    (i) The rights and defenses that would be available to a designated 
applicant or responsible party for whom the guaranty was provided; and
    (ii) The incident (i.e., oil-spill discharge or a substantial threat 
of the discharge of oil) leading to the claim for removal costs or 
damages was caused by willful misconduct of a responsible party for whom 
the designated applicant demonstrated OSFR.
    (b) You may not change, omit, or add limitations or exceptions to 
the terms and conditions in an MMS form that you submit as part of your 
OSFR demonstration. If you attempt to do this, MMS will disregard the 
changes, omissions, additions, limitations, or exceptions and by 
operation of this rule MMS will consider the form to contain all the 
terms and conditions included on the original MMS form.


<R05>
Sec. 253.42  How can I amend my list of COFs?

    (a) If you want to add a COF that is not identified in your current 
OSFR demonstration, you must submit to MMS a completed Form MMS-1022. If 
applicable, you also must submit any additional indemnities, surety 
bonds, insurance certificates, or other instruments required to extend 
the coverage of your original OSFR demonstration to the COFs to be 
added. You do not need to resubmit previously accepted audited annual 
financial statements for the current fiscal year.
    (b) If you want to drop a COF identified in your current OSFR 
demonstration, you must submit to MMS a completed Form MMS-1022. You 
must continue to demonstrate OSFR for the COF until MMS approves OSFR 
evidence for the COF from another designated applicant, or OSFR is no 
longer required (e.g., until a well that

[[Page 484]]

is a COF is properly plugged and abandoned).


<R05>
Sec. 253.43  When is my OSFR demonstration or the amendment to my OSFR 
demonstration effective?

    (a) MMS will notify you in writing when we approve your OSFR 
demonstration. If we find that you have not submitted all the 
information needed to demonstrate OSFR, we may require you to provide 
additional information before we determine whether your OSFR evidence is 
acceptable.
    (b) Except in the case of self-insurance or an indemnity, MMS 
acceptance of OSFR evidence is valid until the surety bond, insurance 
certificate, or other accepted OSFR instrument expires or is canceled. 
In the case of self-insurance or indemnity, acceptance is valid until 
the first day of the 5th month after the close of your or your 
indemnitor's current fiscal year.


<R05>
Sec. 253.44  When must I comply with this part?

    If you are the designated applicant for one or more COFs covered by 
a Certificate of Financial Responsibility (CFR) issued under 33 CFR part 
135 that expires after October 13, 1998, you must submit to MMS your 
evidence of OSFR for all your COFs no later than the earliest date that 
an existing CFR for any of your COFs expires. All other designated 
applicants must submit to MMS evidence of OSFR for their COFs no later 
than April 8, 1999.

                   Subpart E_Revocation and Penalties


<R05>
Sec. 253.50  How can MMS refuse or invalidate my OSFR evidence?

    (a) If MMS determines that any OSFR evidence you submit fails to 
comply with the requirements of this part, we may not accept it. If we 
do not accept your OSFR evidence, then we will send you a written 
notification stating:
    (1) That your evidence is not acceptable;
    (2) Why your evidence is unacceptable; and
    (3) The amount of time you are allowed to submit acceptable evidence 
without being subject to civil penalty under Sec. 253.51.
    (b) MMS may immediately and without prior notice invalidate your 
OSFR demonstration if you:
    (1) Are no longer eligible to be the designated applicant for a COF 
included in your demonstration; or
    (2) Permit the cancellation or termination of the insurance policy, 
surety bond, or indemnity upon which the continued validity of the 
demonstration is based.
    (c) If MMS determines you are not complying with the requirements of 
this part for any reason other than paragraph (b) of this section, we 
will notify you of our intent to invalidate your OSFR demonstration and 
specify the corrective action needed. Unless you take the corrective 
action MMS specifies within 15 calendar days from the date you receive 
such a notice, we will invalidate your OSFR demonstration.


<R05>
Sec. 253.51  What are the penalties for not complying with this part?

    (a) If you fail to comply with the financial responsibility 
requirements of OPA at 33 U.S.C. 2716 or with the requirements of this 
part, then you may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $25,000 per 
COF per day of violation (that is, each day a COF is operated without 
acceptable evidence of OSFR).
    (b) MMS will determine the date of a noncompliance. MMS will assess 
penalties in accordance with an OSFR penalty schedule using the 
procedures found at 30 CFR part 250, subpart N. You may obtain a copy of 
the penalty schedule from MMS at the address in Sec. 253.45.
    (c) MMS may assess a civil penalty against you that is greater or 
less than the amount in the penalty schedule after taking into account 
the factors in section 4303(a) of OPA (33 U.S.C. 2716a).

[[Page 485]]

    (d) If you fail to correct a deficiency in the OSFR evidence for a 
COF, then the Director may suspend operation of a COF in the OCS under 
30 CFR 250.170 or seek judicial relief, including an order suspending 
the operation of any COF.

 chapter 7 or 11.               designated applicant and/or any of the
                                responsible parties for the COF; or
                               (iii) Present your claim to the Fund
                                using the procedures at 33 CFR part 136.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) An assertion of            (i) Pursue any of the remedies in items

                               (iii) Initiate a lawsuit against any of
                                the designated applicant's guarantors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) If no one has resolved your claim to your satisfaction using the 
remedy that you elected under paragraph (b) of this section, then you 
may pursue another available remedy, unless the Fund has denied your 
claim or a court of competent jurisdiction has ruled against your claim. 
You may not pursue more than one remedy at a time.
    (d) You may ask MMS to assist you in determining whether a guarantor 
may be liable for your claim. Send your request for assistance to the 
address listed in Sec. 253.45. You must include any information you 
have regarding the existence or identity of possible guarantors.


<R05>
Sec. 253.61  When is a guarantor subject to direct action for claims?

    (a) If you are a guarantor, then you are subject to direct action 
for any claim asserted by:
    (1) The United States for any compensation paid by the Fund under 
OPA, including compensation claim processing costs; and
    (2) A claimant other than the United States if the designated 
applicant has:
    (i) Denied or failed to pay a claim because of being insolvent; or
    (ii) Filed a petition in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. chapters 7 or 
11.

<R04>
                            Subpart A_General


<R05>
Sec. 254.1  Who must submit a spill-response plan?

    (a) If you are the owner or operator of an oil handling, storage, or 
transportation facility, and it is located seaward of the coast line, 
you must submit a spill-response plan to MMS for approval. Your spill-
response plan must demonstrate that you can respond quickly and 
effectively whenever oil is discharged from your facility. Refer to 
Sec. 254.6 for the definitions of ``oil,'' ``facility,'' and ``coast 
line'' if you have any doubts about whether to submit a plan.
    (b) You must maintain a current response plan for an abandoned 
facility until you physically remove or dismantle the facility or until 
the Regional Supervisor notifies you in writing that a plan is no longer 
required.
    (c) Owners or operators of offshore pipelines carrying essentially 
dry gas do not need to submit a plan. You must, however, submit a plan 
for a pipeline that carries:
    (1) Oil;
    (2) Condensate that has been injected into the pipeline; or
    (3) Gas and naturally occurring condensate.
    (d) If you are in doubt as to whether you must submit a plan for an 
offshore facility or pipeline, you should check with the Regional 
Supervisor.
    (e) If your facility is located landward of the coast line, but you 
believe your facility is sufficiently similar to OCS facilities that it 
should be regulated by MMS, you may contact the Regional Supervisor, 
offer to accept MMS jurisdiction over your facility, and request that 
MMS seek from the agency with jurisdiction over your facility a 
relinquishment of that jurisdiction.


<R05>
Sec. 254.2  When must I submit a response plan?

    (a) You must submit, and MMS must approve, a response plan that 
covers each facility located seaward of the coast line before you may 
use that facility. To continue operations, you

[[Page 489]]

must operate the facility in compliance with the plan.
    (b) Despite the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, you may 
operate your facility after you submit your plan while MMS reviews it 
for approval. To operate a facility without an approved plan, you must 
certify in writing to the Regional Supervisor that you have the 
capability to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst 
case discharge or a substantial threat of such a discharge. The 
certification must show that you have ensured by contract, or other 
means approved by the Regional Supervisor, the availability of private 
personnel and equipment necessary to respond to the discharge. 
Verification from the organization(s) providing the personnel and 
equipment must accompany the certification. MMS will not allow you to 
operate a facility for more than 2 years without an approved plan.
    (c) If you have a plan that MMS already approved, you are not 
required to immediately rewrite the plan to comply with this part. You 
must, however, submit the information this regulation requires when 
submitting your first plan revision (see Sec. 254.30) after the 
effective date of this rule. The Regional Supervisor may extend this 
deadline upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 254.3  May I cover more than one facility in my response plan?

    (a) Your response plan may be for a single lease or facility or a 
group of leases or facilities. All the leases or facilities in your plan 
must have the same owner or operator (including affiliates) and must be 
located in the same MMS Region (see definition of Regional Response Plan 
in Sec. 254.6).
    (b) Regional Response Plans must address all the elements required 
for a response plan in Subpart B, Oil Spill Response Plans for Outer 
Continental Shelf Facilities, or Subpart D, Oil Spill Response 
Requirements for Facilities Located in State Waters Seaward of the Coast 
Line, as appropriate.
    (c) When developing a Regional Response Plan, you may group leases 
or facilities subject to the approval of the Regional Supervisor for the 
purposes of:
    (1) Calculating response times;
    (2) Determining quantities of response equipment;
    (3) Conducting oil-spill trajectory analyses;
    (4) Determining worst case discharge scenarios; and
    (5) Identifying areas of special economic and environmental 
importance that may be impacted and the strategies for their protection.
    (d) The Regional Supervisor may specify how to address the elements 
of a Regional Response Plan. The Regional Supervisor also may require 
that Regional Response Plans contain additional information if necessary 
for compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 254.4  May I reference other documents in my response plan?

    You may reference information contained in other readily accessible 
documents in your response plan. Examples of documents that you may 
reference are the National Contingency Plan (NCP), Area Contingency Plan 
(ACP), MMS environmental documents, and Oil Spill Removal Organization 
(OSRO) documents that are readily accessible to the Regional Supervisor. 
You must ensure that the Regional Supervisor possesses or is provided 
with copies of all OSRO documents you reference. You should contact the 
Regional Supervisor if you want to know whether a reference is 
acceptable.


<R05>
Sec. 254.5  General response plan requirements.

    (a) The response plan must provide for response to an oil spill from 
the facility. You must immediately carry out the provisions of the plan 
whenever there is a release of oil from the facility. You must also 
carry out the training, equipment testing, and periodic drills described 
in the plan, and these measures must be sufficient to ensure the safety 
of the facility and to mitigate or prevent a discharge or a substantial 
threat of a discharge.
    (b) The plan must be consistent with the National Contingency Plan 
and the appropriate Area Contingency Plan(s).
    (c) Nothing in this part relieves you from taking all appropriate 
actions necessary to immediately abate the

[[Page 490]]

source of a spill and remove any spills of oil.
    (d) In addition to the requirements listed in this part, you must 
provide any other information the Regional Supervisor requires for 
compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.

available to any authorized MMS representative upon request.


<R05>
Sec. 254.44  Calculating response equipment effective daily recovery 
capacities.

    (a) You are required by Sec. 254.26(d)(1) to calculate the 
effective daily recovery capacity of the response equipment identified 
in your response plan that you would use to contain and recover your 
worst case discharge. You must calculate the effective daily recovery 
capacity of the equipment by multiplying the manufacturer's rated 
throughput capacity over a 24-hour period by 20 percent. This 20 percent 
efficiency factor takes into account the limitations of the recovery 
operations due to available daylight, sea state, temperature, viscosity, 
and emulsification of the oil being recovered. You must use this 
calculated rate to determine if you have sufficient recovery capacity to 
respond to your worst case discharge scenario.
    (b) If you want to use a different efficiency factor for specific 
oil recovery devices, you must submit evidence to substantiate that 
efficiency factor. Adequate evidence includes verified performance data 
measured during actual spills or test data gathered according to the 
provisions of Sec. 254.45 (b) and (c).


<R05>
Sec. 254.45  Verifying the capabilities of your response equipment.

    (a) The Regional Supervisor may require performance testing of any 
spill-response equipment listed in your response plan to verify its 
capabilities if the equipment:
    (1) Has been modified;
    (2) Has been damaged and repaired; or
    (3) Has a claimed effective daily recovery capacity that is 
inconsistent with data otherwise available to MMS.
    (b) You must conduct any required performance testing of booms in 
accordance with MMS-approved test criteria. You may use the document 
``Test Protocol for the Evaluation of Oil-Spill Containment Booms,'' 
available from MMS, for guidance. Performance testing of skimmers also 
must be conducted in accordance with MMS approved test criteria. You may 
use the document ``Suggested Test Protocol for the Evaluation of Oil 
Spill Skimmers for the OCS,'' available from MMS, for guidance.

[[Page 498]]

    (c) You are responsible for any required testing of equipment 
performance and for the accuracy of the information submitted.


<R05>
Sec. 254.46  Whom do I notify if an oil spill occurs?

    (a) You must immediately notify the National Response Center (1-800-
424-8802) if you observe:
    (1) An oil spill from your facility;
    (2) An oil spill from another offshore facility; or
    (3) An offshore spill of unknown origin.
    (b) In the event of a spill of 1 barrel or more from your facility, 
you must orally notify the Regional Supervisor without delay. You also 
must report spills from your facility of unknown size but thought to be 
1 barrel or more.
    (1) If a spill from your facility not originally reported to the 
Regional Supervisor is subsequently found to be 1 barrel or more, you 
must then report it without delay.
    (2) You must file a written followup report for any spill from your 
facility of 1 barrel or more. The Regional Supervisor must receive this 
confirmation within 15 days after the spillage has been stopped. All 
reports must include the cause, location, volume, and remedial action 
taken. Reports of spills of more than 50 barrels must include 
information on the sea state, meteorological conditions, and the size 
and appearance of the slick. The Regional Supervisor may require 
additional information if it is determined that an analysis of the 
response is necessary.
    (c) If you observe a spill resulting from operations at another 
offshore facility, you must immediately notify the responsible party and 
the Regional Supervisor.


<R05>
Sec. 254.47  Determining the volume of oil of your worst case discharge 
scenario.

    You must calculate the volume of oil of your worst case discharge 
scenario as follows:
    (a) For an oil production platform facility, the size of your worst 
case discharge scenario is the sum of the following:
    (1) The maximum capacity of all oil storage tanks and flow lines on 
the facility. Flow line volume may be estimated; and
    (2) The volume of oil calculated to leak from a break in any 
pipelines connected to the facility considering shutdown time, the 
effect of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces and 
other factors; and
    (3) The daily production volume from an uncontrolled blowout of the 
highest capacity well associated with the facility. In determining the 
daily discharge rate, you must consider reservoir characteristics, 
casing/production tubing sizes, and historical production and reservoir 
pressure data. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well 
flowing for 30 days as required by Sec. 254.26(d)(1).
    (b) For exploratory or development drilling operations, the size of 
your worst case discharge scenario is the daily volume possible from an 
uncontrolled blowout. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must 
consider any known reservoir characteristics. If reservoir 
characteristics are unknown, you must consider the characteristics of 
any analog reservoirs from the area and give an explanation for the 
selection of the reservoir(s) used. Your scenario must discuss how to 
respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by Sec. 
254.26(d)(1).
    (c) For a pipeline facility, the size of your worst case discharge 
scenario is the volume possible from a pipeline break. You must 
calculate this volume as follows:
    (1) Add the pipeline system leak detection time to the shutdown 
response time.
    (2) Multiply the time calculated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
by the highest measured oil flow rate over the preceding 12-month 
period. For new pipelines, you should use the predicted oil flow rate in 
the calculation.
    (3) Add to the volume calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
the total volume of oil that would leak from the pipeline after it is 
shut in. Calculate this volume by taking into account the effects of 
hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces, length of 
pipeline segment, tie-ins with other pipelines, and other factors.

[[Page 499]]

    (d) If your facility which stores, handles, transfers, processes, or 
transports oil does not fall into the categories listed in paragraph 
(a), (b), or (c) of this section, contact the Regional Supervisor for 
instructions on the calculation of the volume of your worst case 
discharge scenario.

<R05>
Sec. 256.0  Authority for information collection.

    (a) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the 
information collection requirements in this part under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq. OMB assigned the control number 1010-0006. The title of this 
information collection is ``30 CFR Part 256, Leasing of Sulphur or Oil 
and Gas in the Outer Continental Shelf.''
    (b) MMS collects this information to determine if the applicant 
filing for a lease on the Outer Continental Shelf is qualified to hold 
such a lease. Response is required to obtain a benefit according to 43 
U.S.C. 1331 et seq. MMS will protect proprietary information collected 
according to section 26 of the OCS Lands Act and 30 CFR 256.10.
    (c) An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number.
    (d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of 
information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the 
burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Minerals 
Management Service, Mail Stop 4230, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC

<R05>
Sec. 256.1  Purpose.

    The purpose of the regulations in this part is to establish the 
procedures under which the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) will 
exercise the authority to administer a leasing program for oil, gas and 
sulphur. The procedures under which the Secretary will exercise the 
authority to administer a program to grant rights-of-way, rights-of-use 
and easements are addressed in other parts.

[64 FR 72795, Dec. 28, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 256.2  Policy.

    The management of Outer Continental Shelf resources is to be 
conducted in accordance with the findings, purposes and policy 
directions provided by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments 
of 1978 (43 U.S.C. 1332, 1801, 1802), and other Executive, legislative, 
judicial and Departmental guidance. The Secretary of the Interior shall 
consider available environmental information in making decisions 
affecting Outer Continental Shelf resources.


<R05>
Sec. 256.4  Authority.

    The outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) (43 U.S.C. 1331 et 
seq.) authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue, on a 
competitive basis, leases for oil and gas, and sulphur, in submerged 
lands of the outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The Act authorizes the 
Secretary to grant rights-of-way, rights-of-use and easements through 
the submerged lands of the OCS. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act 
of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6213), prohibits joint bidding by major oil and gas 
producers.

recording the bids received and no bids shall be accepted or rejected at 
that time.
    (b) The United States reserves the right to reject any and all bids 
received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.
    (c) In the event the highest bids are tie bids, the tie bidders 
(unless they would be disqualified under Sec. 256.35(b) of this part, 
or disqualified under Sec. 256.44 of this part if their bids had been 
joint bids) may file with the Director, within 15 days after 
notification, an agreement to accept the lease jointly; otherwise all 
bids shall be rejected.
    (d) Pursuant to section 8(c) of the Act, the Attorney General may 
review the results of the lease sale prior to the

acceptance of bids and issuance of leases.
    (e)(1) The decision of the authorized officer on bids shall be the 
final action of the Department, subject only to reconsideration by the 
Secretary, pursuant to written request, of the rejection of the high 
bid. The delegation of review authority to the Office of Hearings and 
Appeals shall not be applicable to decisions on high bids for leases on 
the Outer Continental Shelf.
    (2) The authorized officer must accept or reject the bid within 90 
days. The authorized officer may extend the time period for acceptance 
or rejection of a bid for 15 working days or longer, if circumstances 
warrant. Any bid not accepted within the prescribed time period, 
including any extension thereof, is deemed rejected.
    (3) Any high bidder whose bid is rejected by the authorized officer 
may, within 15 days of such rejection, file with the Secretary, with a

the balance of the bonus bid. The bidder must also file a bond as 
required in Sec. 256.52 of this title. Deposits and any interest 
accrued shall be refunded on high bids subsequently rejected.
    (g) If the successful bidder fails to execute the lease within the 
prescribed time or otherwise comply with the applicable regulations the 
deposit shall be forfeited and disposed of as other receipts under the 
Act.
    (h) If, before the lease is executed on behalf of the United States, 
the land which would be subject to the lease is withdrawn or restricted 
from leasing, all deposits and any interest due shall be refunded.
    (i) If the awarded lease is executed by an agent acting on behalf of 
the bidder, the lease shall be accompanied by evidence that the bidder 
authorized the agent to execute the lease. When three copies of the 
lease are executed and returned to the authorized officer, the lease 
shall be executed on behalf of the United States, and one fully executed 
copy shall be transmitted to the successful bidder.
    (j) No lease or permit shall be issued for any area within 15 
statute miles of the boundaries of the Point Reyes Wilderness in

Sec. 256.52  Bond requirements for an oil and gas or sulphur lease.

    This section establishes bond requirements for the lessee of an OCS 
oil and gas or sulphur lease.

[[Page 515]]

    (a) Before MMS will issue a new lease or approve the assignment of 
an existing lease to you as lessee, you or another record title owner 
for the lease must:
    (1) Maintain with the Regional Director a $50,000 lease bond that 
guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease; or
    (2) Maintain a $300,000 areawide bond that guarantees compliance 
with all the terms and conditions of all your oil and gas and sulphur 
leases in the area where the lease is located; or
    (3) Maintain a lease or areawide bond in the amount required in 
Sec. 256.53(a) or (b) of this part.
    (b) For the purpose of this section, there are three areas. The area 
offshore the Atlantic Coast is included in the Gulf of Mexico. Areawide 
bonds issued in the Gulf of Mexico will cover oil and gas or sulphur 
operations offshore the Atlantic Coast. The three areas are:
    (1) The Gulf of Mexico and the area offshore the Atlantic Coast.
    (2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, 
Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii; and
    (3) The area offshore the Coast of Alaska.
    (c) The requirement to maintain a lease bond (or substitute security 
instruments) under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and Sec. 256.53 (a) 
and (b) is satisfied if your operator provides a lease bond in the 
required amount that guarantees compliance with all the terms and 
conditions of the lease. Your operator may use an areawide bond under 
this paragraph to satisfy your bond obligation.
    (d) If a surety makes payment to the United States under a bond or 
alternative form of security maintained under this section, the surety's 
remaining liability under the bond or alternative form of security is 
reduced by the amount of that payment. See paragraph (e) of this section 
for the requirement to replace the reduced bond coverage.
    (e) If the value of your surety bond or alternative security is 
reduced because of a default, or for any other reason, you must provide 
additional bond coverage sufficient to meet the security required under 
this subpart within 6 months, or such shorter period of time as the 
Regional Director may direct.
    (f) You may pledge U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) 
securities instead of a bond. The Treasury securities you pledge must be 
negotiable for an amount of cash equal to the value of the bond they 
replace.
    (1) If you pledge Treasury securities under this paragraph (f), you 
must monitor their value. If their market value falls below the level of 
bond coverage required under this subpart, you must pledge additional 
Treasury securities to raise the value of the securities pledged to the 
required amount.
    (2) If you pledge Treasury securities, you must include authority 
for the Regional Director to sell them and use the proceeds when the 
Regional Director determines that you fail to satisfy any lease 
obligation.
    (g) You may pledge alternative types of security instruments instead 
of providing a bond if the Regional Director determines that the 
alternative security protects the interests of the United States to the 
same extent as the required bond.
    (1) If you pledge an alternative type of security under this 
paragraph, you must monitor the security's value. If its market value 
falls below the level of bond coverage required under this subpart, you 
must pledge additional securities to raise the value of the securities 
pledged to the required amount.
    (2) If you pledge an alternative type of security, you must include 
authority for the Regional Director to sell the security and use the 
proceeds when the Regional Director determines that you failed to 
satisfy any lease obligation.
    (h) If you fail to replace a deficient bond or to provide additional 
bond coverage upon demand, the Regional Director may:
    (1) Assess penalties under part 250, subpart N of this chapter;
    (2) Suspend production and other operations on your leases in 
accordance with Sec. 250.110 of this chapter; and
    (3) Initiate action to cancel your lease.

before lease exploration activities commence.
    (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director a $200,000 bond that 
guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by 
the earliest of:
    (A) The date you submit a proposed Exploration Plan (EP) for 
approval;
    (B) The date you submit a request for approval of the assignment of 
a lease on which an EP has been approved; or
    (C) December 8, 1997, for any lease for which an EP has been 
approved.
    (ii) The Regional Director may authorize you to submit the $200,000 
lease exploration bond after you submit an EP but before he/she approves 
drilling activities under the EP.
    (iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph (a) by 
providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.
    (2) A $200,000 lease exploration bond pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section need not be submitted and maintained if the lessee 
either:
    (i) Furnishes and maintains an areawide bond in the sum of $1 
million issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with 
all the terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulphur leases held by 
the lease on the OCS for the area in which the lessee is situated; or
    (ii) Furnishes and maintains a bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section.
    (b) This paragraph explains what bonds you (the lessee) must provide 
before lease development and production activities commence.
    (1)(i) You must furnish the Regional Director a $500,000 bond that 
guarantees compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease by 
the earliest of:
    (A) The date you submit a proposed Development and Production Plan 
(DPP) or Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) for 
approval;
    (B) The date you submit a request for approval of the assignment of 
a lease on which a DPP or DOCD has been approved; or
    (C) December 8, 1997, for any lease for which a DPP or DOCD has been

approves the installation of a platform or the commencement of drilling 
activities under the DPP or DOCD.
    (iii) You may satisfy the bond requirement of this paragraph by 
providing a new bond or by increasing the amount of your existing bond.
    (2) The lessee need not submit and maintain a $500,000 lease 
development bond pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the 
lessee furnishes and maintains an areawide bond in the sum of $3 million 
issued by a qualified surety and conditioned on compliance with all the 
terms and conditions of oil and gas and sulphur leases held by the 
lessee on the OCS for the area in which the lease is situated.
    (c) When a lessee can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
authorized officer that wells and platforms can be abandoned and removed 
and the drilling and platform sites cleared of obstructions for less 
than the amount of lease bond coverage required under paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, the authorized officer may accept a lease surety bond 
in an amount less than the prescribed amount but not less than the 
amount of the cost for well abandonment, platform removal, and site 
clearance.
    (d) The Regional Director may determine that additional security 
(i.e., security above the amounts prescribed in Sec. Sec. 256.52(a) and 
256.53 (a) and (b) of this part) is necessary to ensure compliance with 
the obligations under your lease and the regulations in this chapter.
    (1) The Regional Director's determination will be based on his/her 
evaluation of your ability to carry out present and future financial 
obligations demonstrated by:
    (i) Financial capacity substantially in excess of existing and 
anticipated lease and other obligations, as evidenced by audited 
financial statements (including auditor's certificate, balance sheet, 
and profit and loss sheet);

[[Page 517]]

    (ii) Projected financial strength significantly in excess of 
existing and future lease obligations based on the estimated value of 
your existing OCS lease production and proven reserves of future 
production;
    (iii) Business stability based on 5 years of continuous operation 
and production of oil and gas or sulphur in the OCS or in the onshore 
oil and gas industry;
    (iv) Reliability in meeting obligations based on:
    (A) Credit rating(s); or
    (B) Trade references, including names and addresses of other 
lessees, drilling contractors, and suppliers with whom you have dealt; 
and
    (v) Record of compliance with laws, regulations, and lease terms.
    (2) You may satisfy the Regional Director's demand for additional 
security by increasing the amount of your existing bond or by providing 
a supplemental bond or bonds.
    (e) The Regional Director will determine the amount of supplemental 
bond required to guarantee compliance. The Regional Director will 
consider potential underpayment of royalty and cumulative obligations to 
abandon wells, remove platforms and facilities, and clear the seafloor 
of obstructions in the Regional Director's case-specific analysis.
    (f) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities either 
increase or decrease, the Regional Director may adjust the amount of 
supplemental bond required.
    (1) If the Regional Director proposes an adjustment, the Regional 
Director will:
    (i) Notify you and the surety of any proposed adjustment to the 
amount of bond required; and
    (ii) Give you an opportunity to submit written or oral comment on 
the adjustment.
    (2) If you request a reduction of the amount of supplemental bond 
required, you must submit evidence to the Regional Director 
demonstrating that the projected amount of royalties due the Government 
and the estimated costs of lease abandonment and cleanup are less than 
the required bond amount. If the Regional Director finds that the 
evidence you submit is convincing, he/she may reduce the amount of 
supplemental bond required.

Sec. 256.56  Lease-specific abandonment accounts.

    (a) The Regional Director may authorize you to establish a lease-

by MMS within the timeframe the Regional Director prescribes.
    (3) You must provide binding instructions under which the 
institution managing the account is to purchase Treasury securities 
pledged to MMS under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Any interest paid on funds in a lease-specific abandonment 
account will be treated as other funds in the account unless the 
Regional Director authorizes in writing the payment of interest to the 
party who deposits the funds.
    (c) The Regional Director may allow you to pledge Treasury 
securities that are made payable upon demand to the Regional Director to 
satisfy your obligation to make payments into a lease-specific 
abandonment account.
    (d) Before the amount of funds in a lease-specific abandonment 
account equals the maximum insurable amount as determined by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance 
Corporation, the institution managing the account must use the funds in 
the account to purchase Treasury securities pledged to MMS under 
paragraph (c) of this section. The institution managing the lease 
specific-abandonment account will join with the Regional Director to 
establish a Federal Reserve Circular 154 account to hold these Treasury 
securities, unless the Regional Director authorizes the managing 
institution to retain the pledged Treasury securities in a separate 
trust account. You may obtain a copy of the current Treasury Circular 
No. 154 from the Surety Bond Branch, Financial Management Service, 
Department of the Treasury, East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782.
    (e) The Regional Director may require you to create an overriding 
royalty or production payment obligation for the benefit of a lease-
specific account pledged for the abandonment and clearance of a lease.

production from a lease other than the lease bonded through the lease-
specific abandonment account.

liabilities, taking into account liabilities under its guarantee of

Sec. 256.58  Termination of the period of liability and cancellation of 
a bond.

    This section defines the terms and conditions under which MMS will 
terminate the period of liability of a bond or cancel a bond. 
Terminating the period of liability of a bond ends the period during 
which obligations continue to accrue but does not relieve the surety of 
the responsibility for obligations that accrued during the period of 
liability. Canceling a bond relieves the surety of all liability. The 
liabilities that accrue during a period of liability include obligations 
that started to accrue prior to the beginning of the period of liability 
and had not been met and obligations that begin accruing during the 
period of liability.
    (a) When the surety under your bond requests termination:
    (1) The Regional Director will terminate the period of liability 
under your bond within 90 days after MMS receives the request; and

[[Page 521]]

    (2) If you intend to continue operations, or have not met all end of 
lease obligations, you must provide a replacement bond of an equivalent 
amount.
    (b) If you provide a replacement bond, the Regional Director will 
cancel your previous bond and the surety that provided your previous 
bond will not retain any liability, provided that:
    (1) The new bond is equal to or greater than the bond that was 
terminated, or you provide an alternative form of security, and the 
Regional Director determines that the alternative form of security 
provides a level of security equal to or greater than that provided for 
by the bond that was terminated;
    (2) For a base bond submitted under Sec. 256.52(a) or under Sec.  
256.53(a) or (b), the surety issuing the new bond agrees to assume all 
outstanding liabilities that accrued during the period of liability that 
was terminated; and
    (3) For supplemental bonds submitted under Sec. 256.53(d), the 
surety issuing the new supplemental bond agrees to assume that portion 
of the outstanding liabilities that accrued during the period of 
liability which was terminated and that the Regional Director determines 
may exceed the coverage of the base bond, and of which the Regional 
Director notifies the provider of the bond.
    (c) This paragraph applies if the period of liability is terminated 
for a bond but the bond is not replaced by a bond of an equivalent 
amount. The surety that provided your terminated bond will continue to 
be responsible for accrued obligations:
    (1) Until the obligations are satisfied; and
    (2) For additional periods of time in accordance with paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    (d) When your lease expires or is terminated, the surety that issued 
a bond will continue to be responsible, and the Regional Director will 
retain other forms of security as shown in the following table:

forfeited upon his/her estimate of the total cost of corrective action 
to bring your lease into compliance.
    (2) Advise you, your third-party guarantor, and any surety, that 
you, your guarantor, and any surety may avoid forfeiture if, within 5 
working days:

into compliance within the timeframe that the Regional Director 
prescribes;
    (ii) Your third-party guarantor agrees to, and demonstrates that it

cause the forfeiture of any bonds and other security deposited as your 
guarantee of compliance with the terms and conditions of your lease and 
the regulations in this chapter.
    (e) If the Regional Director determines that your bond and/or other 
security is forfeited, the Regional Director will:
    (1) Collect the forfeited amount; and
    (2) Use the funds collected to bring your leases into compliance and 
to correct any default.
    (f) If the amount the Regional Director collects under your bond and 
other security is insufficient to pay the full cost of corrective 
actions he/she may:
    (1) Take or direct action to obtain full compliance with your lease 
and the regulations in this chapter; and
    (2) Recover from you, any co-lessee, operating rights owner, and/or 
any third-party guarantor responsible under this subpart all costs in 
excess of the amount he/she collects under your forfeited bond and other 
security.
    (g) The amount that the Regional Director collects under your 
forfeited bond and other security may exceed the costs of taking the 
corrective actions required to obtain full compliance with the terms and 
conditions of your lease and the regulations in this chapter. In this 
case, the Regional Director will return the excess funds to the party 
from whom they were collected.

Sec. 256.64  How to file transfers.

    This section explains how to file instruments with MMS that create

    (a) You must submit to the Regional Director for approval all 
instruments that create or transfer ownership of a lease interest.
    (1) You must submit two copies of the instruments that create or 
transfer an interest. Each instrument that creates or transfers an 
interest must describe by officially designated subdivision the interest 
you propose to create or transfer.
    (2) You must submit your proposal to create or transfer an interest, 
or create or transfer separate operating rights, subleases, and record 
title interests within 90 days of the last date that a party executes 
the transfer agreement.
    (3) The transferee must meet the citizenship and other qualification 
criteria specified in Sec. 256.35 of this part. When you submit an 
instrument to create or transfer an interest as an association, you must 
include a statement signed by the transferee about the transferee's 
citizenship and qualifications to own a lease.
    (4) Your instrument to create or transfer an interest must contain 
all of

[[Page 524]]

the terms and conditions to which you and the other parties agree.
    (5) You do not gain a release of any nonmonetary obligation under 
your lease or the regulations in this chapter by creating a sublease or 
transferring operating rights.
    (6) You do not gain a release from any accrued obligation under your 
lease or the regulations in this chapter by assigning your record title 
interest in the lease.
    (7) You may create or transfer carried working interests, overriding 
royalty interests, or payments out of production without obtaining the 
Regional Director's approval. However, you must file instruments 
creating or transferring carried working interests, overriding royalty 
interests, or payments out of production with the Regional Director for 
record purposes.
    (8) You must pay the service fee listed in Sec. 256.63 of this 
subpart with your application for approval of any instrument of transfer 
you are required to file (Record Title/Operating Rights (Transfer) Fee). 
Where multiple transfers of interest are included in a single 
instrument, a separate fee applies to each individual transfer of 
interest. For any document you are not required to file by these 
regulations but which you submit for record purposes per lease affected, 
you must also pay the service fee listed in Sec. 256.63 (Non-required 
Document Filing Fee). Such documents may be rejected at the discretion 
of the authorized officer.
    (9) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(8) of this 
section, the requirements to pay a filing fee in connection with any 
application for approval of any instrument of transfer and to pay a fee 
in connection with documents not required to be filed are suspended

operating rights or sublease, shall furnish evidence of authority to 
execute the assignment or application for approval and the statement 
required by Sec. 256.46 of this part.

your record title interest in a lease or that creates a segregated 
lease, your assignee must furnish a bond in the amount prescribed in 
Sec. Sec. 256.52 and 256.53 of this part.
    (d) When you request approval for an assignment that assigns less 
than all the record title of a lease and that does not create a separate 
lease, the assignee may, with the surety's consent, become a joint 
principal on the surety instrument that guarantees compliance with all 
the terms and conditions of the lease.
    (e) An heir or devisee of a deceased holder of a lease, or any 
interest therein, shall be recognized as the lawful successor to such 
lease or interest, if evidence of status as an heir or devisee is 
furnished in the form of:
    (1) A certified copy of an appropriate order or decree of the court 
having jurisdiction of the distribution of the estate or,
    (2) If no court action is necessary, the statements of two 
disinterested parties having knowledge of the facts or a certified copy 
of the will.
    (f) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this 
section, the heirs or devisees shall file statements that they are the 
persons named as successors to the estate with evidence of their 
qualifications as provided in Sec. 256.46 of this part.
    (g) In the event an heir or devisee is unable to qualify to hold the 
lease or interest, the heir or devisee shall be recognized as the lawful 
successor of the deceased and be entitled to hold the lease for a period 
of not to exceed 2 years from the date of death of the predecessor in 
interest.

regulations in this chapter.
    (1) You are jointly and severally liable for the performance of each 
nonmonetary obligation under the lease and under the regulations in this 
chapter with each prior lessee and with each operating rights owner 
holding an interest at the time the obligation accrued, unless this 
chapter provides otherwise.
    (2) Sublessees and operating rights owners are jointly and severally 
liable for the performance of each nonmonetary obligation under the 
lease and

[[Page 525]]

under the regulations in this chapter to the extent that:
    (i) The obligation relates to the area embraced by the sublease;
    (ii) Those owners held their respective interest at the time the 
obligation accrued; and
    (iii) This chapter does not provide otherwise.
    (i) Where the proposed assignment or transfer is by a person who, at 
the time of acquisition of an interest in the lease, was on the List of 
Restricted Joint Bidders, and that assignment or transfer is of less 
than the entire interest of the assignor or transferor, to a person or 
persons on the same List of Restricted Joint Bidders, the assignor or 
transferor shall file a copy, prior to approval of the assignment, of 
all agreements applicable to the acquisition of that lease or a 
fractional interest.

    A separate instrument of assignment shall be filed for each lease.

for approval and one showing as to the qualifications of the assignee 
shall be sufficient.

sulfur, subject to section 6(b)(2) of the Act) shall continue in effect, 
and, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency, shall take 
precedence over these regulations.
    (b) A lease maintained under section 6(a) of the Act shall also be 
subject to all operating and conservation regulations applicable to the 
OCS. In addition, the regulations relating to geophysical and geological 
exploratory operations and to pipeline rights-of-way are applicable, to 
the extent that those regulations are not contrary to or inconsistent 
with the lease provisions relating to area, the minerals, rentals, 
royalties and term. The lessee shall comply with any provision of the 
lease as validated, the subject matter of which is not covered in the 
regulations in this part.

<R05>
Sec. 256.80  Leases of other minerals.

    The existence of a lease that meets the requirements of section 6(a) 
of the Act shall not preclude the issuance of other leases of the same 
area for deposits of other minerals. However, no other lease of minerals 
shall authorize or permit the lessee thereunder unreasonably to 
interfere with or endanger operations under the existing lease. No 
sulphur leases shall be granted by the United States on any area while 
such area is included in a lease covering sulphur under section 6(b) of 
the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 256.82  Environmental studies.

    (a) The Director shall conduct a study of any area or region 
included in any lease sale in order to establish information needed for 
assessment and management of impacts on the human, marine and coastal 
environments which may be affected by OCS oil and gas activities in such 
area or region. Any study shall, to the extent practicable, be designed 
to predict environmental impacts of pollutants introduced into the 
environments and of the impacts of offshore activities on the seabed and 
affected coastal areas.
    (b) Studies shall be planned and carried out in cooperation with the 
affected States and interested parties and, to the extent possible, 
shall not duplicate studies done under other laws. Where appropriate, 
the Director shall, to the maximum extent practicable, enter into 
agreements with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 
executing the environmental studies responsibilities. By agreement, the 
Director may also utilize services, personnel or facilities of any 
Federal, State or local government agency in the conduct of such study.
    (c) Any study of an area or region required by paragraph (a) of this 
section for a lease sale shall be commenced not later than six months 
prior to holding a lease sale for that area. The Director may utilize 
information collected in any prior study. The Director may initiate 
studies for areas or regions not identified in the leasing program.
    (d) After the leasing and developing of any area or region, the 
Director shall conduct such studies as are deemed necessary to establish 
additional information and shall monitor the human, marine and coastal 
environments of such area or region in a manner designed to provide 
information which can be compared with the results of studies conducted 
prior to OCS oil and gas development. This shall be done to identify any 
significant changes in the quality and productivity of such 
environments, to establish trends in the areas studies, and

[[Page 528]]

to design experiments identifying the causes of such changes. Findings 
from such studies shall be used to recommend modifications in practices 
which are employed to mitigate the effects of OCS activities and to 
enhance the data/information base for predicting impacts which might 
result from a single lease sale or cumulative OCS activities.
    (e) Information available or collected by the studies program shall, 
to the extent practicable, be provided in a form and in a timeframe that 
can be used in the decision-making process associated with a specific 
leasing action or with longer term OCS minerals management 
responsibilities.

<R05>
Sec. 260.111  What conditions apply to the bidding systems that MMS uses?

    (a) For each of the bidding systems in Sec. 260.110, we will 
include an annual rental fee. Other fees and provisions may apply as 
well. The Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register 
will specify the annual rental and any other fees the highest 
responsible qualified bidder must pay and any other provisions.
    (b) If we use any deferment or schedule of payments for the cash 
bonus bid, we will specify and include it in the Notice of OCS Lease 
Sale published in the Federal Register.
    (c) For the bidding systems listed in this subpart, if the bid 
variable is a cash bonus bid, the highest bid by a qualified bidder 
determines the amount of cash bonus to be paid. We will include the 
minimum bid level(s) in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the 
Federal Register.
    (d) For the bidding systems listed in this subpart, if the bid 
variable is the royalty rate, the highest bid by a qualified bidder 
determines the royalty rate to be paid. We will include the minimum 
royalty rate(s) in the Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal 
Register.
    (e) We may, by rule, add to or modify the bidding systems listed in 
Sec. 260.110, according to the procedural requirements of the OCSLA, 43 
U.S.C. 1331 et seq., as amended by Public Law 95-372, 92 Stat. 629.

                             Eligible Leases


<R05>
Sec. 260.112  How do royalty suspension volumes apply to eligible leases?

    Royalty suspension volumes, as specified in section 304 of the Act, 
apply to eligible leases that meet the criteria in Sec. 260.113. For 
purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 260.113 through 260.117:
    (a) Any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing 
under the lease or the regulations (e.g., fuel gas) do not count against 
royalty suspension volumes; and
    (b) Production includes volumes allocated to a lease under an 
approved unit agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 260.113  When does an eligible lease qualify for a royalty 
suspension volume?

    (a) Your eligible lease may receive a royalty suspension volume only 
if it is in a field where no current lease produced oil or gas (other 
than test production) before November 28, 1995. For

[[Page 533]]

eligible leases, the bidding system in Sec. 260.110(g) applies only to 
leases in fields that meet this condition.
    (b) You may receive a royalty suspension volume only if your entire 
lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. A field that 
lies on both sides of that meridian will receive a royalty suspension 
volume only for those eligible leases lying entirely west of the 
meridian.


<R05>
Sec. 260.114  How does MMS assign and monitor royalty suspension volumes 
for eligible leases?

    (a) We will assign your lease that has a qualifying well (under part 
250, subpart A of this title) to an existing field or designate a new 
field and will notify you and other affected lessees and operating 
rights holders in the field of that assignment.
    (1) Within 15 days of that notification, you or any of the other 
affected lessees or operating rights holders may file a written request 
with the Director of MMS (Director) for reconsideration accompanied by a 
``Statement of Reasons.''
    (2) The Director will respond in writing either affirming or 
reversing the assignment decision. The Director's decision is the final 
action of the Department of the Interior and is not subject to appeal to 
the Interior Board of Land Appeals under part 290 of this title and 43 
CFR part 4.
    (b) We have specified the water depth for each eligible lease in the 
final Notice of OCS Lease Sale. Our determination of water depth for 
each lease is final once we issue the lease. We have specified in the 
Notice the royalty suspension volume applicable to each water depth. The 
minimum royalty suspension volumes for fields in million barrels of oil 
equivalent (MMBOE) are shown in the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             Minimum royalty suspension
               Water depth                             volume
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) 200 to 400 meters....................  17.5 MMBOE
(2) 400 to 800 meters....................  52.5 MMBOE
(3) 800 meters or more...................  87.5 MMBOE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) Before commencing production, you must:
    (1) Notify the MMS Regional Supervisor for Production and 
Development of your intention to start production; and
    (2) Request confirmation of the size of the royalty suspension 
volume that applies to your eligible lease.
    (d) When production (other than test production) first occurs from 
any of the eligible leases in a field, we will determine what royalty 
suspension volume applies to the lease(s) in that field. We base the 
determination for eligible lease(s) on the royalty suspension volumes 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section and the water depths of 
eligible leases specified in Sec. 260.117(a).
    (e) Your eligible lease may obtain more than one royalty suspension 
volume. If a new field is discovered on your eligible lease that already 
benefits from the royalty suspension volume from another field, 
production from that new field receives a separate royalty suspension.

[66 FR 11518, Feb. 23, 2001, as amended at 67 FR 57739, Sept. 12, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 260.115  How long will a royalty suspension volume for an eligible 
lease be effective?

    A royalty suspension volume for an eligible lease will continue 
through the end of the month in which cumulative production from the 
leases in a field entitled to share the royalty suspension volume 
reaches that volume or the lease period ends.


<R05>
Sec. 260.116  How do I measure natural gas production on my eligible 
lease?

    You must measure natural gas production on your eligible lease 
subject to the royalty suspension volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic 
feet of natural gas, measured according to part 250, subpart L of this 
title, equals one barrel of oil equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 260.117  What other provisions apply to royalty suspension volumes 
for eligible leases?

    In addition to the provisions in Sec. Sec. 260.111 through 260.116, 
the provisions in this section apply to royalty suspension volumes on 
eligible leases.
    (a) If a new field consists of eligible leases in different water-
depth categories, the royalty suspension volume associated with the 
eligible lease in the deepest water applies.

[[Page 534]]

    (b) If your eligible lease is the only eligible lease in a field, 
you do not owe royalty on the production from your lease up to the 
applicable royalty suspension volume.
    (c) If a field consists of more than one eligible lease:
    (1) Payment of royalties on the eligible leases' initial production 
is suspended until cumulative production equals the field's established 
royalty suspension volume;
    (2) Only production from leases entitled to share in the field's 
royalty suspension volume counts as part of this cumulative production; 
and
    (3) The royalty suspension volume for each eligible lease is equal 
to each lease's actual production (or production allocated under an 
approved unit agreement) until the field's royalty suspension volume is 
reached.
    (d) This paragraph applies if we add an eligible lease to a field 
that has an established royalty suspension volume that we approved under 
part 203 of this title. This paragraph also applies to a field that has 
an established royalty suspension volume as a result of production 
starting from one or more eligible leases in the field. In situations 
covered by this paragraph:
    (1) The field's royalty suspension volume will not change, even if 
the added lease is in deeper water;
    (2) If we granted a royalty suspension volume under part 203 of this 
title that is larger than the minimum specified for that water depth, 
the added eligible lease may share in the larger suspension volume;
    (3) The eligible lease may receive a royalty suspension volume only 
to the extent of its production before the cumulative production equals 
the field's previously established royalty suspension volume; and
    (4) Only production from leases entitled to share in the field's 
previously established royalty suspension volume counts as part of this 
cumulative production.
    (e) A pre-Act lease may receive a royalty suspension volume under 
part 203 of this title for a field that already has a royalty suspension 
volume due to eligible leases. If this happens, then:
    (1) The eligible and pre-Act leases share a single royalty 
suspension volume;
    (2) The field's royalty suspension volume is the larger of the 
volume for the eligible leases or the volume MMS grants in response to 
the pre-Act leases' application; and
    (3) The suspension volume for each eligible lease is its actual 
production from the lease until cumulative production from all leases in 
the field entitled to share in the field-based suspension volume equals 
the suspension volume.
    (f) If we reassign a well on an eligible lease to another field, the 
past production from that well:
    (1) Will count toward the royalty suspension volume, if any, 
specified for the field to which it is reassigned; and
    (2) Will not count toward the royalty suspension volume, if any, for 
the field from which it was reassigned.

                     Royalty Suspension (RS) Leases


<R05>
Sec. 260.120  How does royalty suspension apply to leases issued in a 
sale held after November 2000?

    We may issue leases with suspension of royalties for a period, 
volume or value of production, as authorized in section 303 of the Act. 
For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec. 260.121 through 260.124:
    (a) Any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing 
under the lease or the regulations (e.g., fuel gas) do not count against 
royalty suspension volumes; and
    (b) Production includes volumes allocated to a lease under an 
approved unit agreement.


<R05>
Sec. 260.121  When does a lease issued in a sale held after November 
2000 get a royalty suspension?

    (a) We will specify any royalty suspension for your RS lease in the 
Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the Federal Register for the sale 
in which you acquire the RS lease and will repeat it in the lease 
document. In addition:
    (1) Your RS lease may produce royalty-free the royalty suspension we 
specify for your lease, even if the field to which we assign it is 
producing.

[[Page 535]]

    (2) The royalty suspension we specify in the Notice of OCS Lease 
Sale for your lease does not apply to any other leases in the field to 
which we assign your RS lease.
    (b) You may apply for a supplemental royalty suspension for a 
project under part 203 of this title, if your lease lies:
    (1) In the Gulf of Mexico,
    (2) In water 200 meters or deeper, and
    (3) Wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.
    (c) Your RS lease retains the royalty suspension with which we 
issued it even if we deny your application for more relief.


<R05>
Sec. 260.122  How long will a royalty suspension volume be effective 
for a lease issued in a sale held after November 2000?

    (a) The royalty suspension volume for your RS lease will continue 
through the end of the month in which cumulative production from your 
lease reaches the applicable royalty suspension volume or the lease 
period ends.
    (b)(1) Notwithstanding any royalty suspension under this subpart, 
you must pay royalty at the lease stipulated rate on:
    (i) Any oil produced for any period stipulated in the lease during 
which the arithmetic average of the daily closing prices on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for light sweet crude oil exceeds a 
threshold price stipulated in the lease, or
    (ii) Any natural gas produced for any period stipulated in the lease 
during which the arithmetic average of the daily closing prices on the 
NYMEX for natural gas exceeds a threshold price stipulated in the lease.
    (2) You must pay any royalty due under this paragraph, plus late 
payment interest under Sec. 218.54 of this title, no later than 90 days 
after the end of the period for which royalty is owed.
    (3) Any production on which you must pay royalty under this 
paragraph will count toward the production volume determined under 
Sec. Sec. 260.120 through 260.124.
    (c) If you must pay royalty on any product (either oil or natural 
gas) for any period under paragraph (b), you must continue to pay 
royalty on that product during the next succeeding period of the same 
length until the arithmetic average of the daily closing NYMEX prices 
for that product for that period can be determined. If the arithmetic 
average of the daily closing prices for that product for that period is 
less than the threshold price stipulated in the lease, you are entitled 
to a credit or refund of royalties paid for that period with interest 
under applicable law.
    (d) MMS will adjust the threshold oil and gas prices referred to in 
paragraph (b) for any period stipulated in the lease by the percentage, 
if any, by which the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic 
product changed during the preceding period.


<R05>
Sec. 260.123  How do I measure natural gas production for a lease issued 
in a sale held after November 2000?

    You must measure natural gas production subject to the royalty 
suspension volume for your lease as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of 
natural gas, measured according to part 250, subpart L of this title, 
equals one barrel of oil equivalent.


<R05>
Sec. 260.124  How will royalty suspension apply if MMS assigns a lease 
issued in a sale held after November 2000 to a field that has an eligible 
or pre-Act lease?

    (a) We will assign your lease that has a qualifying well (under part 
250, subpart A of this title) to an existing field or designate a new 
field and will notify you and other affected lessees and operating 
rights holders in the field of that assignment.
    (1) Within 15 days of the final notification, you or any of the 
other affected lessees or operating rights holders may file a written 
request with the Director for reconsideration, accompanied by a 
Statement of Reasons.
    (2) The Director will respond in writing either affirming or 
reversing the assignment decision. The Director's decision is the final 
action of the Department of the Interior and is not subject to appeal to 
the Interior Board of Land Appeals under part 290 of this title and 43 
CFR part 4.
    (b) If we establish a royalty suspension volume for a field, either 
as a result of an approved application for royalty relief submitted for 
a pre-Act

[[Page 536]]

lease under part 203 of this title or as the result of production 
starting from one or more eligible leases in the field, then:
    (1) Royalty-free production from your RS lease shares from and 
counts as part of any royalty suspension volume under Sec. 260.114(d) 
for the field to which we assign your lease; and
    (2) Your RS lease may continue to produce royalty-free up to the 
royalty suspension we specified for your lease, even if the field to 
which we assign your RS lease has produced all of its royalty suspension 
volume.
    (c) Your lease may share in a suspension volume larger than the 
royalty suspension with which we issued it and to the extent we grant a 
larger volume in response to an application by a pre-Act lease submitted 
under part 203 of this title. To share in any larger royalty suspension 
volume, you must file an application described in Sec. Sec. 203.71 and 
203.83. In no case will royalty-free production for your RS lease be 
less than the royalty suspension specified for your lease.

minerals produced in direct association with the OCS mineral specified 
in the lease but not the rights to minerals specifically reserved.
    (c) The existence of an OCS mineral, oil and gas, or sulphur lease 
shall not preclude the issuance of a lease(s) for other OCS minerals in 
the same area. However, no OCS mineral lease shall authorize or permit 
the lessee thereunder to unreasonably interfere with or endanger 
operations under an existing OCS mineral, oil and gas, or sulphur lease.


<R05>
Sec. 281.9  Jurisdictional controversies.

    In the event of a controversy between the United States and a State 
as to whether certain lands are subject to Federal or State jurisdiction 
(43 U.S.C. 1336), either the Governor or the Secretary may initiate 
negotiations in an attempt to settle the jurisdictional controversy. 
With the concurrence of the Attorney General, the Secretary may enter 
into an agreement with a State with respect to OCS mineral activities 
under the Act or under State authority and to payment and impounding of 
rents, royalties, and other sums and with respect to the offering of 
lands for lease pending settlement of the controversy.

    (b) Within 45 days after receipt of a request submitted under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Director shall either initiate steps 
leading to the offer of OCS minerals for lease and notify the applicant 
of the action taken or inform the applicant of the reasons for not 
initiating steps leading to the offer of OCS minerals for lease.
    (c) Any interested party may at any time submit information to the 
Director concerning the scheduling of proposed lease sales of OCS 
minerals in any area of the OCS. Such information may include but not be 
limited to any of the following:
    (1) Benefits of conducting a lease sale in an area.
    (2) Costs of conducting a lease sale in an area.
    (3) Geohazards which could be encountered in an area.
    (4) Geological information about an area and mineral resource 
potential.
    (5) Environmental information about an area.

<R05>
Sec. 281.12  Request for OCS mineral information and interest.

    (a) When considering whether to offer OCS minerals for lease, the 
Secretary, upon the Department of the Interior's own initiative or as a 
result of a submission under Sec. 281.11, may request indications of 
interest in the leasing of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS 
minerals, or all OCS minerals in the area being considered for lease. 
Requests for information and interest shall be published in the Federal 
Register and may be published elsewhere.
    (b) States and local governments, industry, other Federal Agencies, 
and all interested parties (including the public) may respond to a 
request for information and interest. All information provided to the 
Secretary will be considered in the decision whether to proceed with 
additional steps leading to the offering of OCS minerals for lease.
    (c) The Secretary may request specific information concerning the 
offering of a specific OCS mineral, a group of OCS minerals, or all OCS 
minerals in a broad area for lease or the offering of one or more 
discrete tracts which represent a minable orebody. The Secretary's 
request may ask for comments on OCS areas which have been determined to 
warrant special consideration and analysis. Requests may be for comments 
concerning geological conditions or archaeological resources on the 
seabed; multiple uses of the area proposed for leasing, including 
navigation, recreation and fisheries; and other socioeconomic, 
biological, and environmental information relating to the area proposed 
for leasing.

[54 FR 2049, Jan. 18, 1989, as amended at 59 FR 53094, Oct. 21, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 281.13  Joint State/Federal coordination.

    (a) The Secretary may invite the adjacent State Governor(s) to join 
in, or the adjacent State Governor(s) may request that the Secretary 
join in, the establishment of a State/Federal task force or some other 
joint planning or coordination arrangement when industry interest exists 
for OCS mineral leasing or geological information appears to support the 
leasing of OCS minerals in specific areas. Participation in joint State/
Federal task forces or other arrangements will afford the adjacent State 
Governor(s) opportunity for access to available data and information 
about the area; knowledge of progress made in the leasing process and of 
the results of subsequent exploration and development activities; 
facilitate the resolution of issues of mutual interest; and provide a 
mechanism for planning, coordination, consultation, and other activities 
which the Secretary and the Governor(s) may

[[Page 554]]

identify as contributing to the leasing process.
    (b) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangement are to be 
constituted pursuant to such terms and conditions (consistent with 
Federal law and these regulations) as the Secretary and the adjacent 
State Governor(s) may agree.
    (c) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements will 
provide a forum which the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) may 
use for planning, consultation, and coordination on concerns associated 
with the offering of OCS minerals other than oil, gas, or sulphur for 
lease.
    (d) With respect to the activities authorized under these 
regulations each State/Federal task force may make recommendations to 
the Secretary and adjacent State Governor(s) concerning:
    (1) The identification of areas in which OCS minerals might be 
offered for lease;
    (2) The potential for conflicts between the exploration and 
development of OCS mineral resources, other users and uses of the area, 
and means for resolution or mitigation of these conflicts;
    (3) The economic feasibility of developing OCS mineral resources in 
the area proposed for leasing;
    (4) Potential environmental problems and measures that might be 
taken to mitigate these problems;
    (5) Development of guidelines and procedures for safe, 
environmentally responsible exploration and development practices; and
    (6) Other issues of concern to the Secretary and adjacent State 
Governor(s).
    (e) State/Federal task forces or other such arrangements might also 
be used to conduct or oversee research, studies, or reports (e.g., 
Environmental Impact Statements).


<R05>
Sec. 281.14  OCS mining area identification.

    The Secretary, after considering the available OCS mineral resources 
and environmental data and information, the recommendation of any joint 
State/Federal task force established pursuant to Sec. 281.13 of this 
part, and the comments received from interested parties, shall select 
the tracts to be considered for offering for lease. The selected tracts 
will be considered in the environmental analysis conducted for the 
proposed lease offering.


<R05>
Sec. 281.15  Tract size.

    The size of the tracts to be offered for lease shall be as 
determined by the Secretary and specified in the leasing notice. It is 
intended that tracts offered for lease be sufficiently large to include 
potentially minable OCS mineral orebodies. When the presence of any 
minable orebody is unknown and additional prospecting is needed to 
discover and delineate OCS minerals, the size of tracts specified in the 
leasing notice may be relatively large.


<R05>
Sec. 281.16  Proposed leasing notice.

    (a) Prior to offering OCS minerals in an area for lease, the 
Director shall assess the available information including 
recommendations of any joint State/Federal task force established 
pursuant to Sec. 281.13 of this part to determine lease sale procedures 
to be prescribed and to develop a proposed leasing notice which sets out 
the proposed primary term of the OCS mineral leases to be offered; lease 
stipulations including measures to mitigate potentially adverse impacts 
on the environment; and such rental, royalty, and other terms and 
conditions as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice.
    (b) The proposed leasing notice shall be sent to the Governor(s) of 
any adjacent State(s), and a Notice of its availability shall be 
published in the Federal Register at least 60 days prior to the 
publication of the leasing notice.
    (c) Written comments of the adjacent State Governor(s) submitted 
within 60 days after publication of the Notice of Availability of the 
proposed leasing notice shall be considered by the Secretary.
    (d) Prior to publication of the leasing notice, the Secretary shall 
respond in writing to the comments of the adjacent State Governor(s) 
stating the reasons for accepting or rejecting the Governor's 
recommendations, or for implementing any alternative mutually acceptable 
approach identified in consultation with the Governor(s) as a means to 
provide a reasonable balance between the national interest and the

[[Page 555]]

well being of the citizens of the adjacent State.


<R05>
Sec. 281.17  Leasing notice.

    (a) The Director shall publish the leasing notice in the Federal 
Register at least 30 days prior to the date that OCS minerals will be 
offered for lease. The leasing notice shall state whether oral or sealed 
bids or a combination thereof will be used; the place, date, and time at 
which sealed bids shall be filed; and the place, date, and time at which 
sealed bids shall be opened and/or oral bids received. The leasing 
notice shall contain or reference a description of the tract(s) to be 
offered for lease; specify the mineral(s) to be offered for lease (if 
less than all OCS minerals are being offered); specify the period of 
time the primary term of the lease shall cover; and any stipulation(s), 
term(s), and condition(s) of the offer to lease (43 U.S.C. 1337(k)).
    (b) The leasing notice shall contain a reference to the OCS minerals 
lease form which shall be issued to successful bidders.
    (c) The leasing notice shall specify the terms and conditions 
governing the payment of the winning bid.


<R05>
Sec. 281.18  Bidding system.

    (a) The OCS minerals shall be offered by competitive, cash bonus 
bidding under terms and conditions specified in the leasing notice and 
in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
    (b)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of sealed bids, 
such bids received in response to the leasing notice shall be opened at 
the place, date, and time specified in the leasing notice. The sole 
purpose of opening bids is to publicly announce and record the bids 
received, and no bids shall be accepted or rejected at that time.
    (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject any and all sealed 
bids received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.
    (3) In the event the highest bids are tie bids when using sealed 
bidding procedures, the tied bidders may be permitted to submit oral 
bids to determine the highest cash bonus bidder.
    (c)(1) When the leasing notice specifies the use of oral bids, oral 
bids shall be received at the place, time, and date and in accordance 
with the procedures specified in the leasing notice.
    (2) The Secretary reserves the right to reject all oral bids 
received for any tract, regardless of the amount offered.
    (d) When the leasing notice specifies the use of deferred cash bonus 
bidding, bids shall be received in accordance with paragraph (b) or (c) 
of this section, as appropriate. The high bid will be determined based 
upon the net present value of each total bid. The appropriate discount 
rate will be specified in the leasing notice. High bidders using the 
deferred bonus option shall pay a minimum of 20 percent of the cash 
bonus bid prior to lease issuance. At least a total of 60 percent of the 
cash bonus bid shall be due on or before the 5th anniversary of the 
lease, and payment of the remainder of the cash bonus bid shall be due 
on the 10th anniversary of the lease. The lessee shall submit a bond 
guaranteeing payment of the deferred portion of the bonus, in accordance 
with Sec. 281.33.


<R05>
Sec. 281.19  Lease term.

    An OCS mineral lease for OCS minerals other than sand and gravel 
shall be for a primary term of not less than 20 years as stipulated in 
the leasing notice. The primary lease term for each OCS mineral shall be 
determined based on exploration and development requirements for the OCS 
minerals being offered by the Secretary. An OCS mineral lease for sand 
and gravel shall be for a primary term of 10 years unless otherwise 
stipulated in the leasing notice. A lease will continue beyond the 
specified primary term for so long thereafter as leased OCS minerals are 
being produced in accordance with an approved mining operation or the 
lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of the lease and the 
regulations in this chapter under which a lessee can earn continuance of 
the OCS mineral lease in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 281.20  Submission of bids.

    (a) If the bidder is an individual, a statement of citizenship shall 
accompany the bid.

[[Page 556]]

    (b) If the bidder is an association (including a partnership), the 
bid shall be accompanied by a certified statement indicating the State 
in which it is registered and that the association is authorized to hold 
mineral leases on the OCS, or appropriate reference to statements or 
records previously submitted to an MMS OCS office (including material 
submitted in compliance with prior regulations).

compliance with prior regulations).
    (2) Evidence of authority of persons signing to bind the 
corporation. Such evidence may be in the form of a certified copy of 
either the minutes of the board of directors or of the bylaws indicating 
that the person signing has authority to do so, or a certificate to that 
effect signed by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the corporation 
over the corporate seal, or appropriate reference to statements or 
records previously submitted to an MMS OCS office (including material 
submitted in compliance with prior regulations). Bidders are advised to 
keep their filings current.
    (3) The bid shall be executed in conformance with corporate 
requirements.
    (d) Bidders should be aware of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1860, 
which prohibits unlawful combination or intimidation of bidders.
    (e) When sealed bidding is specified in the leasing notice, a 
separate sealed bid shall be submitted for each bid unit that is bid 
upon as described in the leasing notice. A bid may not be submitted for 
less than a bidding unit identified in the leasing notice.
    (f) When oral bidding is specified in the leasing notice, 
information which must accompany a bid pursuant to paragraph (a), (b), 
or (c) of this section, shall be presented to MMS at the lease sale 
prior to the offering of an oral bid.


<R05>
Sec. 281.21  Award of leases.

    (a)(1) The decision of the Director on bids shall be the final 
action of the Department, subject only to reconsideration by the 
Secretary, pursuant to a written request in accordance with paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. The delegation of review authority to the Office 
of Hearings and Appeals shall not be applicable to decisions on high 
bids for leases in the OCS.
    (2) Any bidder whose bid is rejected by the Director may file a 
written request for reconsideration with the Secretary within 15 days of 
notice of rejection, accompanied by a statement of reasons with a copy 
to the Director. The Secretary shall respond in writing either affirming 
or reversing the decision.
    (b) Written notice of the Director's action in accepting or 
rejecting bids shall be transmitted promptly to those bidders whose 
deposits have been held. If a bid is accepted, such notice shall 
transmit three copies of the lease form to the successful bidder. As 
provided in Sec. 281.26 of this part, the bidder shall, not later than 
the 10th business day after receipt of the lease, execute the lease, pay 
the first year's rental, and unless payment of a portion of the bid is 
deferred, pay the balance of the bonus bid. When payment of a portion of 
the bid is deferred, the successful bidder shall also file a bond to 
guarantee payment of the deferred portion as required in Sec. 281.33. 
Deposits shall be refunded on high bids subsequently rejected. When 
three copies of the lease have been executed by the successful bidder 
and returned to the Director, the lease shall be executed on behalf of 
the United States; and one fully executed copy shall be transmitted to 
the successful bidder.
    (c) If the successful bidder fails to execute the lease within the 
prescribed time or to otherwise comply with the applicable regulations, 
the successful bidder's deposit shall be forfeited and disposed of in 
the same manner as other receipts under the Act.
    (d) If, before the lease is executed on behalf of the United States, 
the land which would be subject to the lease is

[[Page 557]]

withdrawn or restricted from leasing, the deposit shall be refunded.
    (e) If the awarded lease is executed by an agent acting on behalf of 
the bidder, the bidder shall submit with the executed lease, evidence 
that the agent is authorized to act on behalf of the bidder.


<R05>
Sec. 281.22  Lease form.

    The OCS mineral leases shall be issued on the lease form prescribed 
by the Secretary in the leasing notice.


<R05>
Sec. 281.23  Effective date of leases.

    Leases issued under the regulations in this part shall be dated and 
become effective as of the first day of the month following the date 
leases are signed on behalf of the lessor except that, upon written 
request, a lease may be dated and become effective as of the first day 
of the month within which it is signed on behalf of the lessor.


<R04>
                   Subpart C_Financial Considerations


<R05>
Sec. 281.26  Payments.

    (a) For sealed bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage 
of the total amount bid is required to be submitted with the bid. The 
percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in 
the leasing notice. The remittance may be made in cash or by Federal 
Reserve check, commerical check, bank draft, money order, certified 
check, or cashier's check made payable to ``Department of the Interior--
MMS.'' Payment of this portion of the bonus bid may not be made by 
Electronic Funds Transfer.
    (b) For oral bids, a bonus bid deposit of a specified percentage of 
the total amount bid must be submitted to the official designated in the 
leasing notice following the completion of the oral bidding. The 
percentage of bonus bid required to be deposited will be specified in 
the leasing notice. Payment of this portion of the bonus bid shall be 
made by Electronic Fund Transfer within the timeframe specified in the 
leasing notice.
    (c) The deposit received from high bidders will be placed in a 
Treasury account pending acceptance or rejection of the bid. Other bids 
submitted under paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the 
bidders. If the high bid is subsequently rejected, an amount equal to 
that deposited with the high bid will be returned according to 
applicable regulations.
    (d) The balance of the winning bonus bid and all rentals and 
royalties must be paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
this part, the Leasing Notice, and Subchapter A of this chapter.
    (e) For each lease issued pursuant to this subpart, there shall be 
one person identified who shall be solely responsible for all payments 
due and payable under the provisions of the lease. The single 
responsible person shall be designated as the payor for the lease and 
shall be so identified on the Solid Minerals Payor Information Form 
(MMS-4030) in accordance with Sec. 210.201 of this title. The 
designated person shall be responsible for all bonus, rental, and 
royalty payments.
    (f) Royalty shall be computed at the rate specified in the leasing 
notice, and paid in value unless the Secretary elects to have the 
royalty delivered in kind.
    (g) For leases which provide for minimum royalty payments, each 
lessee shall pay the minimum royalty specified in the lease at the end 
of each lease year beginning with the lease year in which production 
royalty is paid (whether the full amount specified in the lease or \1/2\ 
the amount specified in the lease pursuant to Sec. 281.28(b) on this 
part) of OCS minerals produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise 
disposed of) from the leasehold.
    (h) Unless stated otherwise in the lease, product valuation will be 
in accordance with the regulations of this chapter. The value used in 
the computation of royalty shall be determined by the Director. The 
value, for royalty purposes, shall be the gross proceeds received by the 
lessee for produced substances at the point the product is produced and 
placed in its first marketable condition, consistent with prevailing 
practices in the industry. In establishing the value, the Director shall 
consider, in this order: (1) The price received by the lessee; (2) 
commodity and spot market transactions; (3) any other

[[Page 558]]

valuation method proposed by the lessee and approved by the Director; 
and (4) value or cost netback. For non-arm's length transactions, the 
first benchmark will only be accepted if it is not less than the second 
benchmark.
    (i) All payors must submit payments and payment information forms 
and maintain auditable records in accordance with the following Royalty 
Management regulations of this title:

Section 210.200--Required recordkeeping.

<R05>
Sec. 281.27  Annual rental.

    (a) The annual lease rental shall be due and payable in accordance 
with the provisions of this section. No rental shall be due or payable 
under a lease commencing with the first lease anniversary date following 
the commencement of royalty payments on leasehold production computed on 
the basis of the royalty rate specified in the lease except that annual 
rental shall be due for any year in which production from the leasehold 
is not subject to royalty pursuant to Sec. 281.28.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice and 
subsequently issued lease, no annual rental payment shall be due during 
the first 5 years in the life of a lease.
    (c) The leasee shall pay an annual rental in the amount specified in 
the leasing notice and subsequently issued lease not later than the last 
day prior to the commencement of the rental year.
    (d) A rental adjustment schedule and amount may be specified in a 
leasing notice and subsequently issued lease when a variance is 
warranted by geologic, geographic, technical, or economic conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 281.28  Royalty.

    (a) The royalty due the lessor on OCS minerals produced (i.e., sold, 
transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of) from a lease shall be set 
out in a separate schedule attached to and made a part of each lease and 
shall be as specified in the leasing notice. The royalty due on 
production shall be based on a percentage of the value or amount of the 
OCS mineral(s) produced, a sum assessed per unit of product, or other 
such method as the Secretary may prescribe in the leasing notice. When 
the royalty specified is a sum assessed per unit of product, the amount 
of the royalty shall be subject to an annual adjustment based on changes 
in the appropriate price index, when specified in the leasing notice. 
When the royalty is specified as a percentage of the value or amount of 
the OCS minerals produced, the Secretary will notify the lessee when and 
where royalty is to be delivered in kind.
    (b) When prescribed in the leasing notice and subsequently issued 
lease, royalty due on OCS minerals produced from a leasehold will be 
reduced for up to any 5 consecutive years, as specified by the lessee 
prior to the commencement of production, during the 1st through 15th 
year in the life of the lease. No royalty shall be due in any year of 
the specified 5-year period that occurs during the 1st through 10th 
years in the life of the lease, and a royalty of one-half the amount 
specified in the lease shall be due in any year of the specified 5-year 
period that occurs in the 11th through 15th year in the life of the 
lease. The lessee shall pay the amount specified in the lease rental for 
any royalty free year. The minimum royalty specified in the lease shall 
apply during any year of reduced royalty.


<R05>
Sec. 281.29  Royalty valuation.

    The method of valuing the product from a leasehold shall be in 
accordance with regulations of this chapter and

[[Page 559]]

procedures prescribed in the leasing notice and subsequently issued 
lease.


<R05>
Sec. 281.30  Minimum royalty.

    Unless otherwise specified in the leasing notice, each lease issued 
pursuant to the regulations in this part shall require the payment of a 
specified minimum annual royalty beginning with the year in which OCS 
minerals are produced (sold, transferred, used, or otherwise disposed 
of) from the leasehold except that the annual rentals shall apply during 
any year that royalty free production is in effect pursuant to Sec. 
281.28(b). Minimum royalty payments shall be offset by royalty paid on 
production during the lease year. Minimum royalty payments are due at 
the beginning of the lease year and payable by the end of the month 
following the end of the lease year for which they are due.


<R05>
Sec. 281.31  Overriding royalties.

    (a) Subject to the approval of the Secretary, an overriding royalty 
interest may be created by an assignment pursuant to section 8(e) of the 
Act. The Secretary may deny approval of an assignment which creates an 
overriding royalty on a lease whenever that denial is determined to be 
in the interest of conservation, necessary to prevent premature 
abandonment of a producing mine, or to make possible the mining of 
economically marginal or low-grade ore deposits. In any case, the total 
of applicable overriding royalties may not exceed 2.5 percent or one-
half the base royalty due the Federal Government, whichever is less.
    (b) No transfer or agreement may be made which creates an overriding 
royalty interest unless the owner of that interest files an agreement in 
writing that such interest is subject to the limitations provided in 
Sec. 281.30 of this part, paragraph (a) of this section, and Sec.  
281.32 of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 281.32  Waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, minimum royalty 
or production royalty.

    (a) The Secretary may waive, suspend, or reduce the rental, minimum 
royalty, and/or production royalty prescribed in a lease for a specified 
time period when the Secretary determines that it is in the national 
interest, it will result in the conservation of natural resources of the 
OCS, it will promote development, or the mine cannot be successfully 
operated under existing conditions.
    (b) An application for waiver, suspension, or reduction of rental, 
minimum royalty, or production royalty under paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be filed in duplicate with the Director. The application 
shall contain the serial number(s) of the lease(s), the name of the 
lessee(s) of record, and the operator(s) if applicable. The application 
shall either:
    (1)(i) Show the location and extent of all mining operations and a 
tabulated statement of the minerals mined and subject to royalty for 
each of the last 12 months immediately prior to filing the application:
    (ii) Contain a detailed statement of expenses and costs of operating 
the lease, the income from the sale of any lease products, and the 
amount of all overriding royalties and payments out of production paid 
to others than the United States; and
    (iii) All facts showing whether or not the mine(s) can be 
successfully operated under the royalty fixed in the lease; or
    (2) If no production has occurred from the lease, show that the 
lease cannot be successfully operated under the rental, royalty, and 
other conditions specified in the lease.
    (c) The applicant for a waiver, suspension, or reduction under this 
section shall file documentation that the lessee and the royalty holders 
agree to a reduction of all other royalties from the lease so that the 
aggregate of all other royalties does not exceed one-half the amount of 
the reduced royalties that would be paid to the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 281.33  Bonds and bonding requirements.

    (a) When the leasing notice specifies that payment of a portion of 
the bonus bid can be deferred, the lessee shall be required to submit a 
surety or personal bond to guarantee payment of a deferred portion of 
the bid. Upon the payment of the full amount of the cash

[[Page 560]]

bonus bid, the lessee's bond will be released.
    (b) All bonds to guarantee payment of the deferred portion of the 
high cash bonus bid furnished by the lessee must be in a form or on a 
form approved by the Associate Director for Offshore Minerals 
Management. A single copy of the required form is to be executed by the 
principal or, in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an

assigned, in whole or in part, pursuant to section 8(e) of the Act to 
anyone qualified to hold a lease.
    (b) Any approved assignment shall be deemed to be effective on the 
first day of the lease month following the date that it is submitted to 
the Director for approval unless by written request the parties request 
that the effective date be the first of the month in which the Director 
approves the assignment.
    (c) The assignor shall be liable for all obligations under the lease 
occurring prior to the effective date of an assignment.
    (d) The assignee shall be liable for all obligations under the lease 
occurring on or after the effective date of an assignment and shall

    (a)(1) All instruments of transfer of a lease or of an interest 
therein including subleases and assignments of record interest shall be 
filed in triplicate for approval within 90 days from the date of final 
execution. They shall include a statement over the transferee's own 
signature with respect to citizenship and qualifications similar to that 
required of a lessee and shall contain all of the terms and conditions 
agreed upon by the parties thereto.
    (2) An application for approval of any instrument required to be 
filed shall not be accepted unless accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of 
$50. Any document not required to be filed by these regulations but

not be entitled to compensation.
    (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, may be 
canceled by the Secretary upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or 
misrepresentation and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been 
afforded to the lessee.

following:
    (1) Cancellation may occur at any time if the Secretary determines 
after a hearing that:
    (i) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause 
serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), 
to property, to any mineral (in areas leased or not leased), to the 
national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human 
environment;
    (ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
    (iii) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of 
continuing such lease in force;

such lease shall have been under suspension or temporary prohibition by 
the Secretary, with due extension of any lease term continuously for a 
period of 5 years, or for a lesser period upon request of the lessee; 
and
    (3) Cancellation shall entitle the lessee to receive such 
compensation as is shown to the Secretary as being equal to the lesser 
of:
    (i) The fair value of the canceled rights as of the date of 
cancellation, taking into account both anticipated revenues from the 
lease and anticipated costs, including costs of compliance with all 
applicable regulations and operating orders, liability for cleanup costs 
or damages, or both, and all other costs reasonably anticipated on the 
lease, or
    (ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenues from the lease 
(plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of 
reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct 
expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease 
and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to 
the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures 
from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case 
of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more 
partners to exercise due diligence, the innocent parties shall have the 
right to seek damages for such loss from the responsible party or 
parties and the right to acquire the interests of the negligent party or 
parties and be issued the lease in question.
    (iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of 
the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:
    (A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to 
section (5)(d) of the Act;
    (B) A Testing Plan or Mining Plan is disapproved because of the 
lessee's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 
applicable Federal Law; or
    (C) The lessee(s) of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with a 
provision of the Act, the lease, or regulations issued under the Act, 
and the noncompliance continues for a period of 30 days or more after 
the mailing of a notice of noncompliance by registered or certified 
letter to the lessee(s).

a lease or right of use and easement and may require a lessee or holder 
to obtain additional environmental data when deemed necessary to assure 
adequate protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments.
    (2) The Director is to be provided an opportunity to inspect, cut, 
and remove representative portions of all samples acquired by a lessee 
in the course of operations on the lease.
    (c) In addition to the rights and privileges granted to a lessee 
under any lease issued or maintained under the Act, on request, the 
Director may grant a lessee, subject to such conditions as the Director 
may prescribe, a right of use and easement to construct and maintain 
platforms, artificial islands, and/or other installations and devices 
which are permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed and which 
are needed for the conduct of leasehold exploration, testing, 
development, production, and processing activities or other leasehold 
related operations whether on or off the lease.
    (d)(1) The Director may approve the consolidation of two or more OCS 
mineral leases or portions of two or more OCS mineral leases into a 
single mining unit requested by lessees, or the Director may require 
such consolidation when the operation of those leases or portions of 
leases as a single mining unit is in the interest of conservation of the 
natural resources of the OCS or the prevention of waste. A mining unit

[[Page 568]]

may also include all or portions of one or more OCS mineral leases with 
all or portions of one or more adjacent State leases for minerals in a 
common orebody. A single unit operator shall be responsible for 
submission of required Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans covering 
OCS mineral operations for an approved mining unit.
    (2) Operations such as exploration, testing, and mining activities 
conducted in accordance with an approved plan on any lease or portion of 
a lease which is subject to an approved mining unit shall be considered 
operations on each of the leases that is made subject to the approved 
mining unit.
    (3) Minimum royalty paid pursuant to a Federal lease, which is 
subject to an approved mining unit, is creditable against the production 
royalties allocated to that Federal lease during the lease year for 
which the minimum royalty is paid.
    (4) Any OCS minerals produced from State and Federal leases which 
are subject to an approved mining unit shall be accounted for separately 
unless a method of allocating production between State and Federal 
leases has been approved by the Director and the appropriate State 
official.

    (i) Approve any Delineation Plan which is consistent with the 
criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Require the lessee to modify any Delineation Plan that is 
inconsistent with the criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or
    (iii) Disapprove a Delineation Plan when it is determined that an 
activity proposed in the plan would probably cause serious harm or 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life); to property; to 
natural resources of the OCS including mineral deposits (in areas leased 
or not leased); or to the marine, coastal, or human environment, and the 
proposed activity cannot be modified to avoid the conditions.
    (3) The Director shall notify the lessee in writing of the reasons 
for disapproving a Delineation Plan or for requiring modification of a 
plan and the conditions that must be met for plan approval.
    (c)(1) In the evaluation of a Testing Plan, the Director shall 
consider whether the plan is consistent with:
    (i) The provisions of the lease;
    (ii) The provisions of the Act;

other exceptional circumstances and that (A) implementation of the 
activities described in the plan would probably cause serious harm and 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to 
any mineral deposit (in areas leased or not leased), to the national 
security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environments; 
(B) that the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and (C) the 
advantages of disapproving the Testing Plan outweigh the advantages of 
development and production of the OCS mineral resources.
    (3) The Director shall notify the lessee in writing of the reason(s)

existence of exceptional geological conditions in the lease area, 
exceptional resource values in the marine or coastal environment, or 
other exceptional circumstances, and that--
    (A) Implementation of the activities described in the plan would 
probably cause serious harm and damage to life (including fish and other 
aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposit (in areas leased or 
not leased), to the national security or defense, or to the marine, 
coastal, or human environments;
    (B) That the threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease 
to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
    (C) The advantages of disapproving the Mining Plan outweigh the 
advantages of development and production of the OCS mineral resources.
    (3) The Director shall notify the lessee in writing of the reason(s) 
for disapproving a Mining Plan or for requiring modification of a Mining 
Plan and the conditions that must be met for approval of the plan.
    (e) The Director shall assure that a scheduled onsite compliance

operations; and require compliance with applicable provisions of the 
law, the regulations, the lease,

[[Page 570]]

and the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plans. The Director may 
give oral orders or approvals whenever prior approval is required before 
the commencement of an operation or activity. Oral orders or approvals 
given in response to a written request shall be confirmed in writing 
within 3 working days after issuance of the order or granting of the 
oral approval.
    (2) The Director shall, after completion of the technical and 
environmental evaluations, approve, disapprove, or require modification, 
as appropriate, of the design plan, fabrication plan, and installation 
plan for platforms, artificial islands, and other installations and 
devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed. The approval, 
disapproval, or requirement to modify such plans may take the form of a 
condition of granting a right of use and easement under paragraph (a) of 
this section or as authorized under any lease issued or maintained under 
the Act.
    (g) The Director shall establish practices and procedures to govern 
the collection of all rents, royalties, and other payments due the

coastal, or human environment.


<R05>
Sec. 282.13  Suspension of production or other operations.

    (a) The Director may direct the suspension or temporary prohibition 
of production or any other operation or activity on all or any part of a 
lease when it has been determined that such suspension or temporary 
prohibition is in the national interest to:
    (1) Facilitate proper development of a lease including a reasonable 
time to develop a mine and construct necessary support facilities, or
    (2) Allow for the construction or negotiation for use of 
transportation facilities.
    (b) The Director may also direct or, at the request of the lessee, 
approve a suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other 
operation or activity, if:
    (1) The lessee failed to comply with a provision of applicable law, 
regulation, order, or the lease;
    (2) There is a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or 
damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any 
mineral deposit, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;
    (3) The suspension or temporary prohibition is in the interest of 
national security or defense;
    (4) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary for the 
initiation and conduct of an environmental evaluation to define 
mitigation measures to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.
    (5) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to 
facilitate the installation of equipment necessary for safety of 
operations and protection of the environment;
    (6) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to allow 
for undue delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits 
or consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or appeals;
    (7) The Director determines that continued operations would result 
in premature abandonment of a producing mine, resulting in the loss of 
otherwise recoverable OCS minerals;
    (8) The Director determines that the lessee cannot successfully 
operate a producing mine due to market conditions that are either 
temporary in nature or require temporary shutdown and reinvestment in 
order for the lessee to adapt to the conditions; or
    (9) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to comply 
with judicial decrees prohibiting production or any other operation or 
activity, or the permitting of those activities, effective the date set 
by the court for that prohibition.
    (c) When the Director orders or approves a suspension or a temporary

[[Page 571]]

prohibition of operation or activity including production on all of a 
lease pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the term of the 
lease shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time 
that the suspension or temporary prohibition is in effect, except that 
no lease shall be so extended when the suspension or temporary 
prohibition is the result of the lessee's gross negligence or willful 
violation of a provision of the lease or governing regulations.
    (d) The Director may, at any time within the period prescribed for a 
suspension or temporary prohibition issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, require the lessee to submit a Delineation, Testing, or 
Mining Plan for approval in accordance with the requirements for the 
approval of such plans in this part.
    (e)(1) When the Director orders or issues a suspension or a 
temporary prohibition pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the 
Director may require the lessee to conduct site-specific studies to 
identify and evaluate the cause(s) of the hazard(s) generating the 
suspension or temporary prohibition, the potential for damage from the 
hazard(s), and the measures available for mitigating the hazard(s). The 
nature, scope, and content of any study shall be subject to approval by 
the Director. The lessee shall furnish copies and all results of any 
such study to the Director. The cost of the study shall be borne by the 
lessee unless the Director arranges for the cost of the study to be 
borne by a party other than the lessee. The Director shall make results 
of any such study available to interested parties and to the public as 
soon as practicable after the completion of the study and submission of 
the results thereof.
    (2) When the Director determines that measures are necessary, on the 
basis of the results of the studies conducted in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section and other information available to and 
identified by the Director, the lessee shall be required to take 
appropriate measures to mitigate, avoid, or minimize the damage or 
potential damage on which the suspension or temporary prohibition is 
based. When deemed appropriate by the Director, the lessee shall submit 
a revised Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan to incorporate the 
mitigation measures required by the Director. In choosing between 
alternative mitigation measures, the Director shall balance the cost of 
the required measures against the reduction or potential reduction in 
damage or threat of damage or harm to life (including fish and other 
aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or 
not leased), to the national security or defense, or to the marine, 
coastal, or human environment.
    (f)(1) If under the provisions of paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) 
of this section, the Director, with respect to any lease, directs the 
suspension of production or other operations on the entire leasehold, no 
payment of rental or minimum royalty shall be due for or during the 
period of the directed suspension and the time for the lessee specify 
royalty free period of a period of reduced royalty pursuant to Sec. 
281.28(b) of this subchapter will be extended for the period of directed 
suspension. If under the provisions of paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) 
of this section the Director, with respect to a lease on which there has 
been no production, directs the suspension of operations on the entire 
leasehold, no payment of rental shall be due during the period of the 
directed suspension.
    (2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director grants the 
request of a lessee for a suspension of production or other operations, 
the lessee's obligations to pay rental, minimum royalty, or royalty 
shall continue to apply during the period of the approved suspension, 
unless the Director's approval of the lessee's request for suspension 
authorizes the payment of a lesser amount during the period of approved 
suspension. If under the provision of this section, the Director grants 
a lessee's request for a suspension of production or other operations 
for a lease which includes provisions for a time period which the lessee 
may specify during which production from the leasehold would be royalty 
free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation pursuant to Sec. 
281.28(b) of this subchapter, the time during which production from a 
leasehold may be royalty

[[Page 572]]

free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation shall not be extended 
unless the Director's approval of the suspension specifies otherwise.
    (3) If the lease anniversary date falls within a period of 
suspension for which no rental or minimum royalty payments are required 
under paragraph (a) of this section, the prorated rentals or minimum 
royalties are due and payable as of the date the suspension period 
terminates. These amounts shall be computed and notice thereof given the 
lessee. The lessee shall pay the amount due within 30 days after receipt 
of such notice. The anniversary date of a lease shall not change by 
reason of any period of lease suspension or rental or royalty relief 
resulting therefrom.


<R05>
Sec. 282.14  Noncompliance, remedies, and penalties.

    (a)(1) If the Director determines that a lessee has failed to comply 
with applicable provisions of law; the regulations in this part; other 
applicable regulations; the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or 
Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and the Director 
determines that such noncompliance poses a threat of immediate, serious, 
or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine or the deposit being 
mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other resources, the 
Director shall order the lessee to take immediate and appropriate 
remedial action to alleviate the threat. Any oral orders shall be 
followed up by service of a notice of noncompliance upon the lessee by 
delivery in person to the lessee or agent, or by certified or registered 
mail addressed to the lessee at the last known address.
    (2) If the Director determines that the lessee has failed to comply 
with applicable provisions of law; the regulations in this part; other 
applicable regulations; the lease; the requirements of an approved 
Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or 
instructions, and such noncompliance does not pose a threat of 
immediate, serious, or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine 
or the deposit being mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other 
resources, the Director shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the 
lessee by delivery in person to the lessee or agent or by certified or 
registered mail addressed to the lessee at the last known address.
    (b) A notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect(s) the 
lessee has failed to comply with the provisions of applicable law; 
regulations; the lease; the requirements of an approved Delineation, 
Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and 
shall specify the action(s) which must be taken to correct the 
noncompliance and the time limits within which such action must be 
taken.
    (c) Failure of a lessee to take the actions specified in the notice 
of noncompliance within the time limit specified shall be grounds for a 
suspension of operations and other appropriate actions, including but 
not limited to the assessment of a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per 
day for each violation that is not corrected within the time period 
specified (43 U.S.C. 1350(b)).
    (d) Whenever the Director determines that a violation of or failure 
to comply with any provision of the Act; or any provision of a lease, 
license, or permit issued pursuant to the Act; or any provision of any 
regulation promulgated under the Act probably occurred and that such 
apparent violation continued beyond notice of the violation and the 
expiration of the reasonable time period allowed for corrective action, 
the Director shall follow the procedures concerning remedies and 
penalties in subpart N, Remedies and Penalties, of part 250 of this 
title to determine and assess an appropriate penalty.
    (e) The remedies and penalties prescribed in this section shall be 
concurrent and cumulative, and the exercise of one shall not preclude 
the exercise of the other. Further, the remedies and penalties 
prescribed in this section shall be in addition to any other remedies 
and penalties afforded by any other law or regulation (43 U.S.C. 
1350(e)).


<R05>
Sec. 282.15  Cancellation of leases.

    (a) Whenever the owner of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with 
any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued 
under the

[[Page 573]]

Act, and the default continues for a period of 30 days after mailing of 
notice by registered or certified letter to the lease owner at the 
owner's record post office address, the Secretary may cancel the lease 
pursuant to section 5(c) of the Act, and the lessee shall not be 
entitled to compensation. Any such cancellation is subject to judicial 
review as provided by section 23(b) of the Act.
    (b) Whenever the owner of any producing lease fails to comply with 
any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued 
under the Act, the Secretary may cancel the lease only after judicial 
proceedings pursuant to section 5(d) of the Act, and the lessee shall 
not be entitled to compensation.
    (c) Any lease issued under the Act, whether producing or not, may be 
canceled by the Secretary upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or 
misrepresentation and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been 
afforded to the lessee.
    (d) The Secretary may cancel a lease in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Cancellation may occur at any time if the Secretary determines 
after a hearing that--
    (i) Continued activity pursuant to such lease would probably cause 
serious harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), 
to property, to any mineral (in areas leased or not leased), to the 
national security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human 
environment;
    (ii) The threat of harm or damage will not disappear or decrease to 
an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
    (iii) The advantages of cancellation outweigh the advantages of 
continuing such lease in force.

such lease shall have been under suspension or temporary prohibition by 
the Secretary, with due extension of any lease term continuously for a 
period of 5 years or for a lesser period upon request of the lessee;
    (3) Cancellation shall entitle the lessee to receive such 
compensation as is shown to the Secretary as being equal to the lesser 
of--
    (i) The fair value of the canceled rights as of the date of 
cancellation, taking account of both anticipated revenues from the lease 
and anticipated costs, including costs of compliance with all applicable 
regulations and operating orders, liability for cleanup costs or 
damages, or both, and all other costs reasonably anticipated on the 
lease, or
    (ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenue from the lease 
(plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of 
reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct 
expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease 
and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to 
the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures 
from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case 
of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more 
partners to exercise due diligence, the innocent parties shall have the 
right to seek damages for such loss from the responsible party or 
parties and the right to acquire the interests of the negligent party or 
parties and be issued the lease in question.
    (iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of 
the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:
    (A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to 
section (5)(d) of the Act;
    (B) A Testing Plan or Mining Plan is disapproved because the 
lessee's failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of 
applicable Federal law; or
    (C) The lessee of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with a

    (b) In all cases where there is more than one lease owner of record, 
one person shall be designated payor for the lease. The payor shall be 
responsible for making all rental, minimum royalty, and royalty 
payments.
    (c) In all cases where lease operations are not conducted by the 
sole lessee, a ``designation of operator'' shall be submitted to and 
accepted by the Director prior to the commencement of leasehold 
operations. This designation when accepted will be recognized as 
authority for the designee to act on behalf of the lessees and to 
fulfill the lessees' obligations under the Act, the lease, and the 
regulations of this part. All changes of address and any termination of 
a designation of operator shall be reported immediately, in writing, to 
the Director. In the case of a termination of a designation of operator 
or in the event of a controversy between the lessee and the designated 
operator, both the lessee and the designated operator will be 
responsible for the protection of the interests of the lessor.
    (d) When required by the Director or at the option of the lessee, 
the lessee shall submit to the Director the designation of a local 
representative empowered to receive notices, provide access to OCS 
mineral and environmental data and information, and comply with orders

the designated representative, the Director shall be notified 
immediately.
    (e) Before beginning operations, the lessee shall inform the 
Director in writing of any designation of a local representative under 
paragraph (d) of this section and the address of the mine office 
responsible for the exploration, testing, development, or production 
activities; the lessee's temporary and permanent addresses; or the name 
and address of the designated operator who will be responsible for the 
operations, and who will act as the local representative of the lessee. 
The Director shall also be informed of each change thereafter in the 
address of the mine office or in the name or address of the local 
representative.
    (f) The holder of a right of use and easement shall exercise its 
rights under the right of use and easement in accordance with the 
regulations of this part.
    (g) A lessee shall submit reports and maintain records in accordance 
with Sec. 282.29 of this part.
    (h) When an oral approval is given by MMS in response to an oral 
request under these regulations, the oral request shall be confirmed in 
writing by the lessee or holder of a right of use and easement within 72 
hours.
    (i) The lessee is responsible for obtaining all permits and 
approvals from MMS or other Agencies needed to carry out exploration, 
testing, development, and production activities under a lease issued 
under part 281 of this title.


<R05>
Sec. 282.21  Plans, general.

    (a) No exploration, testing, development, or production activities, 
except

[[Page 575]]

preliminary activities, shall be commenced or conducted on any lease 
except in accordance with a plan submitted by the lessee and approved by 
the Director. Plans will not be approved before completion of 
comprehensive technical and environmental evaluations to assure that the 
activities described will be carried out in a safe and environmentally 
responsible manner. Prior to the approval of a plan, the Director will 
assure that the lessee is prepared to take adequate measures to prevent 
waste; conserve natural resources of the OCS; and protect the 
environment, human life, and correlative rights. The lessee shall 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director that the lease is in 
good standing, the lessee is authorized and capable of conducting the 
activities described in the plan, and that an acceptable bond has been 
provided.
    (b) Plans shall be submitted to the Director for approval. The 
lessee shall submit the number of copies prescribed by the Director. 
Such plans shall describe in detail the activities that are to be 
conducted and shall demonstrate that the proposed exploration, testing, 
development, and production activities will be conducted in an 
operationally safe and environmentally responsible manner that is 
consistent with the provisions of the lease, applicable laws, and 
regulations. The Governor of an affected State and other Federal 
Agencies shall be provided an opportunity to review and provide comments 
on proposed Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans and any proposal for 
a significant modification to an approved plan. Following review, 
including the technical and environmental evaluations, the Director 
shall either approve, disapprove, or require the lessee to modify its

activities required in Sec. 282.28 of this part and shall submit such 
other environmental data as the Director may require to conform with the 
requirements of these regulations.
    (e)(1) All maps shall be appropriately marked with reference to 
official lease boundaries and elevations marked with reference to sea 
level. When required by the Director, vertical projections and cross 
sections shall accompany plan views. The maps shall be kept current and 
submitted to the Director annually, or more often when required by the 
Director. The accuracy of maps furnished shall be certified by a 
professional engineer or land surveyor.
    (2) The lessee shall prepare such maps of the leased lands as are 
necessary to show the geological conditions as determined from G&G 
surveys, bottom sampling, drill holes, trenching, dredging, or mining. 
All excavations shall be shown in such manner that the volume of OCS 
minerals produced during a royalty period can be accurately ascertained.
    (f) Any lessee who acquires rock, mineral, and core samples under a 
lease shall keep a representative split of each geological sample and a 
quarter longitudinal segment of each core for 5 years during which time 
the samples shall be available for inspection at the convenience of the 
Director who may take cuts of such cores, cuttings, and samples.
    (g)(1) The lessee shall keep all original data and information 
available for inspection or duplication, by the Director at the expense 
of the lessor, as long as the lease continues in force. Should the 
lessee choose to dispose of original data and information once the lease 
has expired, said data and information shall be offered to the lessor 
free of costs and shall, if accepted, become the property of the lessor.
    (2) Navigation tapes showing the location(s) where samples were 
taken and test drilling conducted shall be retained for as long as the 
lease continues in force.
    (h) Lessees shall maintain records in which will be kept an accurate 
account of all ore and rock mined; all ore put through a mill; all 
mineral products produced; all ore and mineral products sold, 
transferred, used, or otherwise disposed of and to whom sold or 
transferred, and the inventory weight, assay value, moisture content, 
base sales price, dates, penalties, and price received. The percentage 
of each of the mineral products recovered and the percentages lost shall 
be shown. The records associated with activities on a lease shall be 
available to the Director for auditing.
    (i) When special forms or reports other than those referred to in 
the regulations in this part may be necessary, instructions for the

<R05>
Sec. 282.30  Right of use and easement.

    (a) A right of use and easement that includes any area subject to a 
lease issued or maintained under the Act shall be granted only after the 
lessee has been notified by the requestor and afforded the opportunity 
to comment on the request. A holder of a right under a right of use and 
easement shall exercise that right in accordance with the requirements 
of the regulations in this part. A right of use and easement shall be 
exercised only in a manner which does not interfere unreasonably with 
operations of any lessee on its lease.

[[Page 584]]

    (b) Once a right of use and easement has been exercised, the right 
shall continue, beyond the termination of any lease on which it may be 
situated, as long as it is demonstrated to the Director that the right 
of use and easement is being exercised by the holder of the right and 
that the right of use and easement continues to serve the purpose 
specified in the grant. If the right of use and easement extends beyond 
the termination of any lease on which the right may be situated or if it 
is situated on an unleased portion of the OCS, the rights of all 
subsequent lessees shall be subject to such right. Upon termination of a 
right of use and easement, the holder of the right shall abandon the 
premises in the same manner that a lessee abandons activities on a lease 
to the satisfaction of the Director.


<R05>
Sec. 282.31  Suspension of production or other operations.

    A lessee may submit a request for a suspension of production or 
other operations. The request shall include justification for granting 
the requested suspension, a schedule of work leading to the initiation 
or restoration of production or other operations, and any other 
information the Director may require.


<R04>
                           Subpart D_Payments


<R05>
Sec. 282.40  Bonds.

    (a) Pursuant to the requirements for a bond in Sec. 281.33 of this 
title, prior to the commencement of any activity on a lease, the lessee 
shall submit a surety or personal bond to cover the lessee's royalty and 
other obligations under the lease as specified in this section.
    (b) All bonds furnished by a lessee or operator must be in a form 
approved by the Associate Director for Offshore Minerals Management. A 
single copy of the required form is to be executed by the principal or, 
in the case of surety bonds, by both the principal and an acceptable 
surety.
    (c) Only those surety bonds issued by qualified surety companies 
approved by the Department of the Treasury shall be accepted. (See 
Department of Treasury Circular No. 570 and any supplemental or 
replacement circulars.)
    (d) Personal bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier's check, 
certified check, or negotiable U.S. Treasury bonds of an equal value to 
the amount specified in the bond. Negotiable Treasury bonds shall be 
accompanied by a proper conveyance of full authority to the Director to 
sell such securities in case of default in the performance of the terms 
and conditions of the lease.
    (e) A bond in the minimum amount of $50,000 to cover the lessee's 
obligations under the lease shall be submitted prior to the commencement 
of any activity on a leasehold. A $50,000 bond shall not be required on 
a lease if the lessee already maintains or furnishes a $300,000 bond 
conditioned on compliance with the terms of leases for OCS minerals 
other than oil, gas, and sulphur held by the lessee on the OCS for the 
area in which the lease is located. A bond submitted pursuant to Sec. 
256.58(a) of this chapter may be amended to include the aforementioned 
condition for compliance. Prior to approval of a Delineation, Testing, 
or Mining Plan, the bond amount shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to 
cover the operations and activities described in the proposed plan.
    (f) For the purposes of this section there are four areas:
    (1) The Gulf of Mexico;
    (2) The area offshore the Pacific Coast States of California, 
Oregon,Washington, and Hawaii;
    (3) The area offshore the coast of Alaska; and
    (4) The area offshore the Atlantic coast.
    (g) A separate bond shall be required for each area. An operator's 
bond may be submitted for a specific lease(s) in the same amount as the 
lessee's bond(s) applicable to the lease(s) involved.
    (h) Where, upon a default, the surety makes a payment to the United 
States of an obligation incurred under a lease, the face amount of the 
surety bond and the surety's liability thereunder shall be reduced by 
the amount of such payment.
    (i) After default, the principal shall, within 6 months after notice 
or within such shorter period as may be fixed by the Director, either 
post a new bond or increase the existing bond to the

[[Page 585]]

amount previously held. In lieu thereof, the principal may, within that 
time, file separate or substitute bonds for each lease. Failure to meet 
these requirements may result in a suspension of operations including 
production on leases covered by such bonds.
    (j) The Director shall not consent to termination of the period of 
liability of any bond unless an acceptable alternative bond has been 
filed or until all the terms and conditions of the lease covered by the 
bond have been met.

Sec. 282.41  Method of royalty calculation.

    In the event that the provisions of royalty management regulations 
do not apply to the specific commodities produced under regulations in 
this part, the lessee shall comply with procedures specified in the 
leasing notice.


<R05>

        Subpart A_Offshore Minerals Management Appeal Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 290.1  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    The purpose of this subpart is to explain the procedures for appeals 
of Minerals Management Service (MMS) Offshore Minerals Management (OMM)

<R05>
Sec. 290.2  Who may appeal?

    If you are adversely affected by an OMM official's final decision or 
order issued under 30 CFR chapter II, subchapter B, you may appeal that 
decision or order to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA). Your 
appeal must conform with the procedures found in this subpart and 43 CFR 
part 4, subpart E. A request for reconsideration of an MMS decision 
concerning a lease bid, authorized in 30 CFR 256.47(e)(3) and 
281.21(a)(1), or a deep water field determination, authorized in 30 CFR 
203.79(a) and 30 CFR 260.110(d)(2), is not subject to the procedures 
found in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 290.3  What is the time limit for filing an appeal?

    You must file your appeal within 60 days after you receive OMM's 
final decision or order. The 60-day time period applies rather than the 
time period provided in 43 CFR 4.411(a). A decision or order is received 
on the date you sign a receipt confirming delivery or, if there is no 
receipt, the date otherwise documented.


<R05>
Sec. 290.4  How do I file an appeal?

    For your appeal to be filed, MMS must receive all of the following 
within 60 days after you receive the decision or order:
    (a) A written Notice of Appeal together with a copy of the decision 
or order you are appealing in the office of the OMM officer that issued 
the decision or order. You cannot extend the 60-day period for that 
office to receive your Notice of Appeal; and
    (b) A nonrefundable processing fee of $150 paid with the Notice of 
Appeal.
    (1) Identify the order you are appealing on the check or other form 
of payment you use to pay the processing fee.
    (2) You cannot extend the 60-day period for payment of the 
processing fee.
    (3) You must pay the processing fee to MMS following the 
requirements for making payments found in 30 CFR 218.51. You are not 
required to use

[[Page 587]]

Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for these payments.


<R05>
Sec. 290.5  Can I obtain an extension for filing my Notice of Appeal?

    You cannot obtain an extension of time to file the Notice of Appeal. 
See 43 CFR 4.411(c).


<R05>
Sec. 290.6  Are informal resolutions permitted?

    (a) You may seek informal resolution with the issuing officer's next 
level supervisor during the 60-day period established in Sec. 290.3.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart precludes resolution by settlement of 
any appeal or matter pending in the administrative process after the 60-
day period established in Sec. 290.3.


<R05>
Sec. 290.7  Do I have to comply with the decision or order while my 
appeal is pending?

    (a) The decision or order is effective during the 60-day period for 
filing an appeal under Sec. 290.3 unless:
    (1) OMM notifies you that the decision or order, or some portion of 
it, is suspended during this period because there is no likelihood of 
immediate and irreparable harm to human life, the environment, any 
mineral deposit, or property; or
    (2) You post a surety bond under 30 CFR 250.1409 pending the appeal 
challenging an order to pay a civil penalty.
    (b) This section applies rather than 43 CFR 4.21(a) for appeals of 
OMM orders.
    (c) After you file your appeal, IBLA may grant a stay of a decision 
or order under 43 CFR 4.21(b); however, a decision or order remains in 
effect until IBLA grants your request for a stay of the decision or 
order under appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 290.8  How do I exhaust my administrative remedies?

    (a) If you receive a decision or order issued under chapter II, 
subchapter B, you must appeal that decision or order to IBLA under 43 
CFR part 4, subpart E to exhaust administrative remedies.
    (b) This section does not apply if the Assistant Secretary for Land 
and Minerals Management or the IBLA makes a decision or order 
immediately effective notwithstanding an appeal.

document by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to 
the addressee of record established in paragraph (b) of this section. 
Instead of certified or registered mail, RMP or a delegated State may 
deliver the document personally to the addressee of record and obtain a 
signature acknowledging the addressee's receipt of the document. 
Official correspondence includes all orders that are appealable under 
this subpart.
    (b) Addressee of record. (1) The addressee of record for 
administrative correspondence for refiners participating in the 
Government's Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program is the position title, 
department name and address, or individual name and address identified 
in the executed royalty oil sale contract. The refiner/purchaser may 
identify, in writing, a different position title, department name and 
address, or individual name and address for billing purposes. The 
refiner must notify MMS, in writing, of all addressee changes.
    (2) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence on 
anyone required to report energy and mineral resources removed from 
Federal and Indian leases to the RMP Production Accounting and Auditing 
System is the most recent position title, department name and address, 
or individual name and address that RMP has in its records for the 
reporter/payor. The reporter/payor is responsible for notifying RMP, in 
writing, of any addressee changes.
    (3) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence 
concerning

[[Page 591]]

onshore Federal leases is the current lessee of record with the Bureau 
of Land Management. For Indian leases, the addressee of record is the 
current lessee of record with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. For offshore 
leases, the addressee of record is the current lessee of record with the 
MMS Offshore Minerals Management Program. The lessee is responsible for 
notifying the appropriate Government office of any addressee changes.
    (4) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence in 
connection with reviews and audits of payor records is the position 
title, department name and address, or individual name and address 
designated, in writing, by the company at the initiation of the audit, 
or the most recent addressee that was specified, in writing, by the 
payor.
    (5) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence 
relating to reporting on the ``Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance'' 
(Form MMS-2014) is the most recent position title, department name and 
address, or individual name and address specified, in writing, by the 
payor. The payor is responsible for notifying RMP, in writing, of any 
addressee changes.
    (6) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence in 
connection with remittances pertaining to rental and bonuses from 
nonproducing Federal leases is the most recent position title, 
department name and address, or individual name and address maintained 
in RMP records. The payor is responsible for notifying RMP, in writing, 
of any addressee changes.
    (7) The addressee of record for serving official correspondence 
including orders, demands, invoices, or decisions, and other actions 
identified with payors reporting to the RMP Auditing and Financial 
System not identified above is the position title, department name and 
address or individual name and address for the payor identified on the 
most recent Payor Confirmation Report (Report No. RPI140R1) of a Payor 
Information Form (PIF) (Form MMS-4025 or Form MMS-4030) returned by RMP 
to the payor for the Federal or Indian lease (see 30 CFR 210.51 and 
210.201).
    (8) If correspondence applies to more than one category identified 
in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section, MMS may serve the 
official correspondence in accordance with the requirements of any one 
paragraph.
    (c) Dates of service. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this 
section, MMS considers official correspondence as served on the date 
that it is received at the address of record established under paragraph 
(b) of this section. A receipt signed by any person at that address is 
evidence of service. If official correspondence is served both 
personally and by registered or certified mail, the date of service is 
the earlier of the two dates, if they are different.
    (d) Constructive service. (1) If delivery cannot be made after 
reasonable effort at the address of record established under paragraph 
(b) of this section, MMS deems official correspondence as constructively 
served 7 days after the date that the document is mailed.
    (2) This provision covers such situations as nondelivery because the 
addressee has moved without filing a forwarding address, the forwarding 
order had expired, delivery was expressly refused, or the document was 
unclaimed where the attempt to deliver is substantiated by U.S. Postal 
Service authorities.
