                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    This subpart provides Agency policy concerning:
    (a) The applicability of Federal rather than State Law in the 
conduct of Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency

    (b) The liability of an auctioneer for conversion of personal

Congress to achieve national purposes of the U.S. Government.
    (a) Instruments evidencing or securing a loan payable to or held by 
the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354, such as promissory notes, bonds, guaranty agreements,

with applicable Federal law.
    (c) In order to implement and facilitate these Federal loan 
programs, the application of local procedures, especially for 
recordation and notification purposes, may be utilized to the fullest 
extent feasible and practicable. However, the use of local procedures 
shall not be deemed or construed to be any waiver by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of Federal immunity from any 
local control, penalty, or liability, or to subject FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to any State required acts or

claim or assert any local immunity, privilege, or exemption to defeat 
the obligation such party incurred in obtaining or assuring such Federal 
benefit or assistance.

<R05>
Sec. 1900.151  General.

    (a) Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2045-BB (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) requires the 
maintenance of high standards of honesty, integrity, and impartiality by 
employees. To reduce the potential for employee conflict of interest, 
any processing, approval, servicing or review activity, including access 
through automated information systems, is conducted only by authorized 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employees who:
    (1) Are not themselves the recipient.
    (2) Are not members of the family or known close relatives of the 
recipient.
    (3) Do not have an immediate working relationship with the 
recipient, the employee related to the recipient, or the employee who 
would normally conduct the activity.
    (4) Do not have a business or close personal association with the 
recipient.
    (b) No provision of this subpart takes precedence over individual 
program requirements or restrictions, especially those restrictions 
found in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Instruction 2045-BB (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 office) relating to eligibility for FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employees, members of families 
of employees, close relatives, or business or close personal associates 
of employees.
    (c) The determination of a case's need for special handling under 
the provisions of this subpart is not an adverse action and, therefore, 
is not subject to appeal.


<R05>

requested information under subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter and 
pertinent program regulations.
    (b) Responsibility of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 employee. An FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-

successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) may be used as the

association is defined in Sec. 1900.152 of this subpart, if the employee 
believes there may be a potential conflict of interest, the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official who is processing or 
servicing the assistance may be notified and special handling requested.

of this subpart). When completed FmHA or its successor agency under

    (3) Notifies the recipient in writing of the change in 
responsibility and any other pertinent information,
    (4) [Reserved]
    (d) Relationship or association established after application for

relationship or association is established after an application has been 
filed or assistance has been provided, both recipient and employee are 
required to notify the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 official who is processing or servicing the assistance. FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Guide Letter 1900-D-1 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office) may be used for the notice.
    (e) Relationship or association with a State Office, Finance Office 
or National Office employee. If an identified relationship or 
association is with an employee at a State Office (other than a State 
Director), Finance Office or National Office, the processing/servicing 
official completes and submits FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 Guide Letter 1900-D-2 (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) to the State Director 
in the normal manner. The State Director reviews the information, 
determines the need for special handling, designates the processing/
servicing official, completes and submits FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 Guide Letter 1900-D-3 (available in any FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) to the 
Administrator for written concurrence. When the Administrator's 
concurrence is received, the State Director returns completed FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Guide Letter 1900-D-3 to 
the original official who completes the action described in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (f) Relationship or association with a State Director. If an 
identified relationship or association is with a State Director, the 
processing/servicing official completes and submits FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Guide Letter 1900-D-2 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office) to the Administrator. The Administrator reviews, determines the 
need for special handling, designates the processing/servicing official, 
completes and returns FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 Guide Letter 1900-D-3 (available in any FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 office) to the original official who completes 
the action described in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (g) Change in relationship or association, status of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 assistance, or employee's duty 
station. If the relationship or association has changed, the application 
denied or the assistance otherwise terminated, or the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employee's duty station 
changed, the designated processing/servicing official completes FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Guide Letter 1900-D-2 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office) with the new information and submits it. The review process 
takes place as described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section 
to determine if processing/servicing activity may return to normal or 
requires another change. If the assistance is denied or otherwise 
terminated, the designated official notifies the original official.

contractors, packagers, and others who provide housing for sale or rent, 
are obligated under the provisions of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1968 to provide fair housing to all persons regardless of race,

[[Page 24]]

    (a) Coverage. The prohibitions against discrimination in the sale, 
rental, or financing of housing contained in title VIII apply to:

families.
    (ii) Any person who has participated as principal in the sale or

successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employees, multiple housing 
borrowers, and those with whom FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 does business (contractors, realtors, packagers) from:
    (1) Refusing to sell or rent a particular dwelling because of a 
person's race, color, religion, or national origin. The following 
actions constitute violations of this provision:
    (i) Refusing to package an RH loan application.
    (ii) Refusing or failing to show a particular dwelling or home in a 
particular subdivision.
    (iii) Directing persons only to areas populated by those of similar

other areas.
    (iv) Representing unsold dwellings or sites as sold to prospective 
buyers.
    (2) Requiring applicants for services to meet different terms or

representation a preference for applicants of a particular race or 
ethnic origin.
    (i) Words indicative of the race or ethnic background of the

subdivision,'' may not be used in advertising housing financed or to be 
financed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (ii) Selection of advertising media and the areas to be covered by 
any advertising must be made to reach potential applicants of all races 
or ethnic origins.
    (c) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
affirmative action. (1) It is the policy of the Farmers Home 
Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to 
administer its housing program affirmatively so individuals of similar 
income levels in the housing market area have housing choices available 
to them regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, or national 
origin. Each participant in FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 housing program shall pursue affirmative fair housing

their eligibility and in concluding sales and rental transactions.
    (2) Applicability. The affirmative fair housing marketing 
requirements shall apply as follows:
    (i) Participants in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 housing programs who request approval for subdivision

assisting five or more families or five or more conditional commitments 
for single family dwelling units during a 12-month period must submit an 
affirmative marketing plan.
    (ii) An Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan is required to be

of five or more units or five or more single-family dwellings located in 
the same subdivision.
    (3) Affirmative fair housing marketing plans will be submitted on 
form HUD 935.2(3-76) or the participant must be a signatory to a 
voluntary affirmative marketing agreement approved by the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. The plan, if submitted on form HUD 
935.2(3-76) shall describe an affirmative program which will meet the 
following requirements:
    (i) Reaching those prospective buyers or tenants, regardless of sex, 
of majority and minority groups in the marketing area who traditionally 
would not be expected to apply for such housing without special outreach 
efforts because of existing racial or socio-economic patterns.

policy in recruiting from both majority and minority groups including 
both sexes, for staff engaged in the sale or rental of properties.

    We are pledged to the letter and spirit of U.S. policy for the 
achievement of equal housing opportunity throughout the nation. We 
encourage and support an affirmative advertising and marketing program 
in which there are no barriers to obtaining housing because of race, 
color, religion, sex, or national origin.

    (vi) Undertaking efforts to publicize the availability of housing 
opportunities to minority persons through the type of media customarily 
used by the applicant or participant, including minority publications 
and other minority outlets available in the housing market area. As part 
of these efforts all advertising must include either the equal housing 
opportunity logo or statement. When illustrations or persons are 
included they shall depict persons of both sexes and of majority and 
minority groups.
    (4) The affirmative fair housing marketing plans or evidence that 
the participant is covered by an approved voluntary affirmative 
marketing agreement must be submitted as follows:
    (i) For subdivisions with the preliminary submission of plans and 
specifications.

labor housing, cooperative housing, technical assistance grants and site 
development loans with SF 424.1, ``Application for Federal Assistance 
(For Non-construction)'', or SF 424.2, ``Application for Federal 
Assistance (For Construction)'', or with the letter of application. 
Subsequent loans or grants extended to the participant will necessitate

    (iii) For conditional commitments for five or more individual 
dwelling units in a 12-month period with the application for the fifth 
conditional commitment.
    (iv) For real estate brokers listing housing properties on an

    (iii) For conditional commitments involving individual dwelling 
units, one year or until all units built through conditional commitments 
issued within the one year period have been sold.
    (iv) For real estate brokers who list acquired rural housing

properties covered under the plan have been sold, whichever is later.

[[Page 26]]

    (6) Affirmative fair housing marketing plans will be reviewed and 
approved by the official authorized to approve the assistance requested. 
The County Supervisor will review and submit with comments to the 
official authorized to approve the assistance requested, those fair 
housing marketing plans where the assistance requested exceeds his 
approval authority. Any participant covered by this section must have an 
approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan for any assistance 
approved 90 or more days after the issuance of these regulations.
    (7) Approved affirmative fair housing marketing plans will be made 
available by the participant for public inspection at the participant's 
place of business and at each sales or rental office. Participants who 
fulfill the requirements of this section by filing a Form HUD 9352(3-76) 
will maintain records to reflect their efforts in fulfilling the 
affirmative fair housing marketing plan. These records will be made 
available for review by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 personnel. Affirmative fair housing marketing plans will be 
reviewed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354

appropriate relief.
    (d) Discrimination complaints. (1) Complaints against FmHA or its

will be sent to the State Director. The State Director will forward the 
complaints to the Administrator, Attention: Equal Opportunity Officer.
    (2) Complaints of discrimination against packagers, contractors or 
others with whom FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
deals should be filed with the Department of Housing and Urban

successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employees and routed through 
the State Director to the Administrator, Attention: Equal Opportunity 
Officer.
    (e) Relations to other regulations. Nothing in this section in any

Sec. 1901.205  Nondiscrimination in construction financed with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan or grant.

    Executive Order 11246 provides for equal employment opportunity 
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and the 
elimination of all facilities segregated on the basis of race, color, 
religion, or national origin on construction work financed by FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 involving a construction

    (a) Compliance. This section applies to Federal or federally 
assisted construction contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000 for 
on-site construction. It also applies to invitations for bids published 
for such construction. If construction work of over $10,000 is partially

    The preamble to regulations establishing a new part 60-4 to 41 CFR

action taken, construction contractors and subcontractors will continue 
to be subject to the goals and timetables for minority utilization on 
Federal and federally

[[Page 33]]

assisted construction existing now under Executive order 11246. Such 
goals are published in appendix B.
    Now, therefore, based on the foregoing and 41 CFR part 60-4, each 
contracting agency, each applicant, and each contractor shall include 
the appropriate goal set forth in appendix A and appendix B in all 
invitations for bids or other solicitations for federally involved 
construction contracts in excess of $10,000. The goals in appendix A 
hereby are established on a nationwide basis as the standards for female 
utilization for all trades.
    Appendix B established the goals for minority utilization which 
shall be applicable for the respective areas set forth in appendix B.
    Appendix A and appendix B shall be effective with respect to 
transactions for which the invitations for bids or other solicitations 
or amendments thereto are sent, on or after May 8, 1978.

<R05>
Sec. 1901.254  Scope.

    FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will evaluate 
all undertakings for possible HA significance. This subpart covers the 
following types of undertakings:
    (a) Undertakings requiring a historical and archeological 
assessment. Although the following undertakings are presumed to involve 
nonfederally owned lands, they may have an effect on properties having 
HA significance and, therefore, will require a historical and 
archeological assessment:
    (1) Loans and grants for the development of business and industry 
including guaranteed loans.
    (2) Loans and grants for multiple family housing projects of 25 or 
more dwelling units.
    (3) Subdivision plans submitted for approval having 25 or more 
building sites.
    (4) Loans and grants in rural areas to construct, enlarge, extend, 
or otherwise improve:
    (i) Community water, sanitary sewage, solid waste disposal, and 
storm waste water disposal systems.
    (ii) Other essential community facilities such as fire and rescue, 
health, safety, public buildings, schools, transportation, traffic, and 
law enforcement.
    (5) Loans to develop community irrigation, drainage, and other soil 
and water conservation and use facilities.
    (6) Loans to acquire and develop grazing land for livestock of an 
association of members.
    (7) Loans in areas designated by the Soil Conservation Service 
(SCS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), to conserve and develop 
natural resources and to contribute to economic improvement of the area.
    (8) Loans to protect and develop land and water resources in small 
watersheds.
    (9) Loans to permit Indian tribes to buy land within their 
reservations.
    (b) Undertakings presumed not to require a historical and 
archeological assessment. The following undertakings are generally 
presumed to involve nonfederally owned lands and not to have an effect 
on properties of historical and archeological value and will therefore 
not usually require a historical and archeological assessment. However, 
when the State Director or County Supervisor finds or has had 
communication or obtains information from a recognized historical and 
archeological authority that a specific undertaking may have an effect 
on a property included or eligible for inclusion in the National 
Register, a historical and archeological assessment will be made.
    (1) Loans to farmers and ranchers in rural areas for the purchase, 
development, and operation of farms and ranches.
    (2) Loans to individual families in rural areas for the purchase, 
construction, or improvement of single family residences.
    (3) Loans and grants for multiple family housing projects of not 
more than 24 family dwelling units.
    (4) Subdivision plans submitted for approval having 24 or less 
building sites.
    (5) Loans to farmers, ranchers, and other rural residents to develop 
land,

[[Page 44]]

water, and other related resources for increased production of food and 
other crops, improved pastures, feed crops, water facilities for 
livestock, and improved habitats for fish and wildlife.
    (6) Emergency and disaster loans to farmers, ranchers and other 
rural residents in declared or designated areas as a result of a major 
or national disaster.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.255  Historical and archeological assessments.

    (a) The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
official, normally the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 County Supervisor, who receives a preapplication or application 
for loan or grant assistance on an undertaking that may have an effect 
on HA properties will, as part of the process, take the following 
actions:
    (1) Carefully review the State supplements issued by the State 
Director pursuant to Sec. 1901.262(a) to determine whether there are any 
properties within the project area that appear in the National Register.
    (2) Document the following:
    (i) A brief narrative report of the findings and conclusions of an 
on-site reconnaissance of the project area.
    (ii) Any ``in-house'' knowledge of known or suspected HA sites in 
the project area.
    (3) Submit the information outlined in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
State Director as part of the preapplication or application.
    (b) Upon receipt of the preapplication/application the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Director will, as a 
concurrent part of the preapplication/application review, prepare a 
historical and archeological assessment of the undertaking. In making 
the assessment the State Director will consider information from the 
following sources:
    (1) State and Regional Clearinghouse comments.
    (2) Information submitted by the County Supervisor pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (3) Factual comments or recommendations of the SHPO or other 
responsible Federal, State, or local officials.
    (4) Any other reliable information concerning properties in the 
project area having HA significance.
    (c) Upon completion of the preapplication or application review, the 
State Director will take the following actions:
    (1) When his assessment indicates that no properties of HA 
significance will be effected by the proposed undertaking, he will 
proceed with processing of the preapplication or application.
    (2) When his assessment indicates that there are properties included 
in the National Register that may be effected by the proposed 
undertaking, he will in consultation with the SHPO, the applicant and 
its representatives, and other appropriate historical and archeological 
authorities plan appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate any adverse 
effects. He will also notify the Advisory Council and Secretary of the 
Interior of the proposed undertaking, and of its possible effect on the 
National Register properties and provide them with a copy of the 
proposed plan in order to afford them a reasonable opportunity for 
comment. Comments that are received with 45 calendar days of 
notification in accordance with the requirements for comment as outlined 
in section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, will 
be considered in further development of the undertaking.
    (3) When his assessment indicates that there are properties thay may 
be eligible for inclusion in the National Register, based on his 
application of the National Register criteria, he will request the 
Regional Director of the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the 
Interior, Attention: Interagency Archeological Services, in writing, to 
cause a survey of the project area to be made to determine the 
significance of the properties in accordance with section 3(b) of Pub. 
L. 93-291. The State Director's letter to the Regional Director should 
request a response within 45 calendar days as to whether the National 
Park Service intends to cause a survey to be made, declines to undertake 
a survey, or that a

[[Page 45]]

survey is not warranted based on available data. The addresses of the 
Regional Offices of the National Park Service are listed in exhibit A of 
this subpart. If no response is received within the 45-day period, the 
State Director will proceed as outlined in paragraph (c)(7) of this 
section.
    (4) The State Director will cooperate fully with the National Park 
Service in the conduct of a survey should one be undertaken to assure 
that:
    (i) The professional archeologist/historian conducting the survey 
provides his written opinion as to the eligibility of any identified 
properties for inclusion in the National Register.
    (ii) When the professional archeologist/historian recommends 
recovery, protection, or preservation of identified properties, the 
National Park Service is requested to undertake this project.
    (5) When the survey made in paragraph (c)(3) of this section does 
not identify any historical and archeological properties that may be 
eligible for inclusion in the National Register, or the National Park 
Service is not going to undertake activity pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(4)(ii) of this section, the State Director, after consultation with 
the SHPO and the National Park Service, will document the findings and 
proceed with processing of the application.
    (6) When the survey identifies properties that may be eligible for 
inclusion in the National Register, the State Director will request the 
SHPO to proceed with the nomination of such properties. The State 
Director will then proceed as outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section for any properties accepted for inclusion in the National 
Register.
    (7) When the National Park Service declines to cause a survey to be 
made or determines that one is not warranted, the State Director will 
document such facts and proceed with processing of the application.


<R05>
Secs. 1901.256-1901.258  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1901.259  Actions to be taken when archeological properties are discovered during construction.

    (a) When properties of significant HA value are discovered during 
construction, the State Director will immediately consult with the 
applicant, the SHPO and the Regional Director of the National Park 
Service to determine whether there is sufficient factual evidence to 
warrant a decision to stop construction and undertake detailed survey 
and recovery.
    (b) When the consultations in paragraph (a) of this section result 
in a determination by the National Park Service to request the applicant 
to stop construction, such stop action should be taken so that the Park 
Service can initiate measures for immediate recovery within 60 days 
after notification of a discovery.
    (c) When the consultations in paragraph (a) of this section do not 
result in a determination by the National Park Service to stop 
construction and to undertake a survey and recovery, construction should 
be permitted to proceed with caution. In the event that the National 
Park Service determines that recovery is necessary, the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 applicant/borrower and the 
Park Service should determine that the consent of all persons, 
associations, or public entities having legal interests in the property 
involved has been secured. Also, the applicant should be informed that 
the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to compensate any person, 
association, or public entity damaged as a result of delay in 
construction or as a result of the temporary loss of the use of public 
or any nonfederally owned land.
    (d) No survey or recovery work will be required which in the 
determination of the State Director would seriously impede FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 actions in providing 
assistance where the State Director determines that immediate action is 
required to avoid loss or damage of life or property. Nevertheless, 
appropriate measures will be taken to the extent practical to preserve, 
protect, or mitigate any damage to properties having HA significance.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.260  Coordination with other agencies.

    (a) When other Agencies are directly involved in any undertaking 
that requires a historical and archeological

[[Page 46]]

assessment, the State Director will contact the Agencies concerned to 
determine if a joint assessment will be prepared and whether a single 
lead Agency will assume primary responsibility for preparing the 
assessment.
    (b) When a lead Agency is agreed upon other than FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354, FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 will provide that Agency with information about 
its respective areas of responsibility. Assessments will indicate Agency 
participation and concurrence.
    (c) When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
program activities are planned that primarily supplement those of the 
SCS, USDA, such as watershed projects, resource conservation and 
development measures, and irrigation and drainage projects, the SCS will 
be designated as the lead Agency.

Sec. 1901.262  State supplement.

    (a) The State Director shall be responsible for preparing a list of 
all properties included in the National Register in his area of 
jurisdiction and issuing such list as a part of a State supplement. Such 
a list will be updated as needed to reflect changes in the National 
Register.
    (b) State Directors may also supplement this subpart and its exhibit 
as appropriate to meet State and local laws and regulations.

hereafter deposited for any purpose in accounts with it in its 
individual capacity under terms and conditions which indicate that the 
Reserve bank will continue to maintain such deposit accounts in its

    (i) As collateral pledged to a Reserve bank (in its individual 
capacity) for advances by it.

    (2) The application of the book-entry procedure under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section shall not detract from or adversely affect the 
relationships that would otherwise exist between a Reserve bank in its 
individual capacity and its depositors concerning any deposit under this 
paragraph. Whenever the book-entry procedure is applied to such FmHA or

bank is authorized to take all action necessary in respect of the book-

successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities.
    (3) A Reserve bank as fiscal agent of the United States acting on 
behalf of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may

    (4) Any person having an interest in FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 securities which are deposited with a Reserve 
bank (in either its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United 
States) for any purpose shall be deemed to have consented to their

103-354 securities pursuant to the provisions of this subpart and in the 
manner and under the procedure prescribed by the Reserve bank.

bank (in its individual capacity or as fiscal agent of the United 
States), or to the United States, or to any transferee or pledgee 
eligible to maintain an appropriate book-entry account in its name with 
a Reserve bank under this subpart is effected and perfected, 
notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, by a Reserve bank 
making an appropriate entry in its records of the securities transferred 
or pledged. The making of such an entry in the records of a Reserve bank 
shall:
    (i) Have the effect of a delivery in bearer form of definitive FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities.
    (ii) Have the effect of a taking of delivery by the transferee or 
pledgee.
    (iii) Constitute the transferee or pledgee a holder.

favor of the pledgee. A transfer or pledge of book-entry FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities effected under this 
paragraph shall have priority over any transfer, pledge, or other 
interest, theretofore or thereafter effected or perfected under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section or any other manner.
    (2) A transfer or pledge of transferable FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 securities, or any interest therein, 
which is maintained by a Reserve bank (in its individual capacity or as 
fiscal agent of the United States) in a book-entry account under this 
subpart, including securities in book-entry form under 
Sec. 1901.506(b)(1)(iii) is effected, and a pledge is perfected by any 
means that would be effective under applicable law to effect a transfer 
or to effect and perfect a pledge of FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 securities, or any interest therein, if the 
securities were maintained by the Reserve bank in bearer definitive 
form. For purposes of transfer or pledge hereunder, book-entry FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities maintained by a 
Reserve bank shall, notwithstanding any provision of law to the 
contrary, be deemed to be maintained in bearer definitive form. A 
Reserve bank maintaining book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 securities, either in its individual capacity or as 
fiscal agent of the United States, is not a bailee for the purposes of 
notification of pledges of these securities under this paragraph, or a 
third person in possession for the purposes of acknowledgment of 
transfers thereof under this paragraph. Where transferable FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities are recorded on the 
books of a depositary (a bank, banking institution, financial firm, or 
similar party, which regularly accepts in the course of its business 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities as a 
custodial service for customers, and maintains accounts in the names of 
such customers reflecting ownership of or interest in such securities) 
for account of the pledgor or transferor thereof and such securities are 
on deposit with a Reserve bank in a book-entry account hereunder, such 
depositary shall, for purposes of perfecting a pledge of such securities 
or effecting delivery of such

[[Page 51]]

securities to a purchaser under applicable provisions of law, be the 
bailee to which notification of the pledge of the securities may be 
given or the third person in possession from which acknowledgment of the 
holding of the securities for the purchaser may be obtained. A Reserve 
bank will not accept notice or advice of a transfer or pledge effected 
or perfected under this paragraph and any such notice or advice shall 
have no effect. A Reserve bank may continue to deal with its depositor 
in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, notwithstanding any 
transfer or pledge effected or perfected under this paragraph.
    (3) No filing or recording with a public recording office or officer 
shall be necessary or effective with respect to any transfer or pledge 
of book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
securities or any interest therein.
    (4) A Reserve bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate instructions, 
convert book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
securities into definitive FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 securities and deliver them in accordance with such 
instructions. No such conversion shall affect existing interest in such 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities.
    (5) A transfer of book-entry FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 securities within a Federal Reserve Bank shall be 
made in accordance with procedures established by the Reserve bank not 
inconsistent with this subpart. The transfer of book-entry FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities by a Reserve bank 
may be made through a telegraphic transfer procedure.

order to a transferee.
    (2) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 securities 
which are actually to be delivered upon withdrawal may be issued in 
bearer or registered form.
    (e) Delivery of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 securities. A Reserve bank which has received FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 securities and effected pledges, made 
entries regarding them, or transferred or delivered them according to 
the instructions of its depositor is not liable for conversion or for 
participation in breach of fiduciary duty even though the depositor had 
no right to dispose of or take other action in respect of the 
securities. A Reserve bank shall be fully discharged of its obligations 
under this subpart by the delivery of FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 securities in definitive form to its depositor or 
upon the order of such depositor. Customers of a member bank or other 
depositary (other than a Reserve bank) may obtain FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 securities in definitive form only by 
causing the depositor of the Reserve bank to order the withdrawal 
thereof from the Reserve bank.

required for the conversion to book-entry FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 securities of registered FmHA or its successor

    (a) Orders and payment. Orders for investment in certificates may be 
placed with the Finance Office by mail, telephone, or in person. Payment 
for purchase of certificates may be made by a wire transfer to the 
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for credit to the Farmers Home 
Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, by a 
certified check or bank draft payable to the Farmers Home Administration 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The rate of interest 
paid on the certificate will be the rate in effect on the date the 
Finance Office receives the payment.
    (b) Registration. (1) The registration used must express the actual 
ownership of a certificate and may not restrict the authority of the 
owner to dispose of it in any manner. FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 reserves the right to treat the registration as 
conclusive ownership. Request for registration must be clear, accurate, 
and complete, and include the appropriate taxpayer identifying number or 
social security number.
    (2) The registration of all certificates owned by the same person, 
organization, or fiduciary should be uniform with respect to the name of 
the owner and, in case of fiduciary, the description of the fiduciary 
capacity. Individual owners should be designated by the names by which 
they are ordinarily known or under which they do business, preferably 
including at least one full given name. The name of an individual may be 
preceded by an applicable title, as, for example ``Mrs.'' ``Mr.'', 
``Miss',' ``Ms.''; ``Dr.'', or ``Rev.'', or followed by a designation 
such as ``M.D.'', ``D.D.'', ``Sr.'', or ``Jr.'', Any other similar 
suffix should be included when ordinarily used or when necessary to 
distinguish the owner from another member of his family. The address 
should include, where appropriate, the name and street, route, or any 
other location feature, and zip code.

[[Page 53]]

    (3) If an erroneously inscribed certificate is received, it should 
not be altered in any respect. FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 should be given full particulars about the error and asked 
to furnish instructions.
    (c) Transfers and exchanges--closed periods--(1) General. Transfer 
of registered certificates should be made by assignment in accordance 
with this section. Registered securities are eligible for denominational 
exchange. Specific instructions for issuance and delivery of new 
certificates signed by the owner or the owner's authorized 
representative must accompany the certificates presented. Certificates 
presented for transfer must be received by FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 not less than 1 full month before the date on 
which they mature. Any certificates so presented which are received too 
late to comply with this provision will be accepted for payment only.
    (2) Closing of transfer books. The transfer books are closed for 1 
full month preceding interest payment dates. If the date set for closing 
falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the books will be closed 
as of the close of business on the last business day preceding that 
date. The books are reopened on the first business day following the 
date on which interest falls due. Registered certificates which have not 
matured, or have been submitted for transfer and are received when the 
books are closed for that certificate, will be processed on or after the 
date such books are reopened. If certificates are received for transfer 
when the books are closed for payment of final interest at maturity, the 
following action will be taken in the absence of different instructions:
    (i) Payment of final interest will be made to the registered owner 
of record on the date the books were closed.
    (ii) Payment of principal will be made to the assignee under a 
proper assignment of the certificate.
    (d) Redemption or payment--(1) General. Certificates are payable in 
regular course of business at maturity. FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 may provide for the exchange of maturing 
certificates. The registered certificates should be presented and 
surrendered for redemption at the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Finance Office. No assignments or evidence in support 
of them will be required by or on behalf of the registered owner or 
assignee for redemption for his or its account, or for redemption-
exchange if the new certificates are to be registered in exactly the 
same names and forms as in the registrations or assignments of the 
certificates surrendered.
    (2) Redemption at maturity. Registered certificates presented and 
surrendered for redemption at maturity need not be assigned unless the 
owner desires that payment be made to some other person. Should the 
owner so desire assignments should be made to the ``Farmers Home 
Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for 
redemption for the account of (inserting name and address of person to 
whom payment is to be made).'' Specific instructions for the issuance 
and delivery of the redemption check signed by the owner or the owner's 
authorized representative must accompany the certificates unless 
included in the assignment. Payment of the principal and interest will 
be made by a check drawn on the Treasurer of the United States to the 
order of the person entitled and mailed in accordance with the 
instructions received. If instructions are not received concerning 
interest, interest will be paid to the registered owner.
    (3) Interest. The interest on FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 certificates accrues and is payable annually. A full 
interest period does not include the day on which the last preceding 
interest became due, but does include the day on which the next 
succeeding interest payment is due. Certificates will cease to bear 
interest on the date of their maturity. The interest on registered 
certificates is payable by checks drawn on the Treasurer of the United 
States to the order of the registered owners, except as otherwise 
provided in this section. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 prepares the interest checks in advance of the interest payment 
date and ordinarily mails them in time to reach the addressees on that 
date. Interest on a registered certificate which has not

[[Page 54]]

matured and which is presented for any transaction when the books for 
that certificate are closed will be paid by check drawn to the order of 
the registered owner of record. On receipt of notice of the death or 
incompetency of an individual named as registered owner, a change in the 
name or in the status of a partnership, corporation, or unincorporated 
association, the removal, resignation, succession, or death of a 
fiduciary or trustee, delivery of interest checks will be withheld 
pending receipt and approval of evidence showing who is entitled to 
receive the interest checks. If the inscriptions on certificates do not 
clearly identify the owners, delivery of interest checks may be withheld 
pending reissue of the certificates in the correct registration, except 
as provided in this section. The final installment of interest will be 
paid by check drawn to the order of the registered owner of record on 
presentation and surrender of the certificate for redemption. To assure 
timely delivery of interest checks, owners should promptly notify FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 of any change of 
address.
    (e) Assignments. Assignments of certificates should be executed by 
the owner or the owner's authorized representative in the presence of an 
officer authorized to certify assignments. Assignments shall be made on 
the back of the certificate. Registered certificates may be assigned to 
a specified transferee or to FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 for redemption or for exchange for other certificates 
offered at maturity. Assignments to ``United States, Farmers Home 
Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354,'' 
``Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 for Transfer,'' or ``Farmers Home Administration or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for Exchange'' will not be 
accepted unless supplemented by specific instructions by or in behalf of 
the owner. If an alteration or erasure has been made in an assignment, a 
new assignment from the assignor should be obtained. Otherwise, an 
affidavit or explanation by the person responsible for the alteration or 
erasure should be submitted for consideration.
    (f) Death of certificate holder. The Finance Office should be 
notified of the death of the registered owner of a certificate. The 
following documents should be forwarded with the notice if available.
    (1) A certified copy of the death certificate.

or Executor (include the mailing address of the Administrator or 
Executor). The Finance Office will notify the person submitting such 
notice and/or documentation if any other records or documents are 
needed. Legal opinions and advice will be obtained by the Finance Office 
as needed from the Regional Attorney. After all legal requirements are 
met, the certificate should be reissued in the name of the current 
owner.
    (g) Replacement. Lost, stolen, destroyed, or mutilated certificates 
will be replaced by the Finance Office on the registered owner's 
compliance with the requirements of Sec. 1901.509.

the effective date of the sale. In other cases, the price will be 
determined by an agreement between the parties.
    (b) Sale of insured notes by private holders to private buyers. (1) 
On receipt of notice from a private holder of intention to assign an 
insured note, the Director, Finance Office, will send the holder:
    (i) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 471-7 
``Notice and Acknowledgment of Sale of Insured or Guaranteed Loan.''
    (ii) A statement of the unpaid principal. If requested the Director, 
Finance Office, will furnish a statement of account instead of or in 
addition to a statement of the unpaid principal.
    (iii) Appropriate information on how to complete the assignment.
    (2) If the Director, Finance Office, is informed that an insured 
note has been assigned and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 is requested to recognize the assignment, the Director, Finance 
Office, will send the assignor Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 471-7, with directions for its execution.
    (3) On receipt of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 471-7 properly executed by the assignor, the Director, Finance 
Office, will complete and execute the acknowledgment section of the 
form. The Director, Finance Office, will retain the original of the 
form, have two facsimile copies made and send one to the assignor, and 
one to the assignee. For any correction or other change to be made in 
the record of the name or address of a private holder, or of a 
designated agent of a private holder, a request will be made to FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in writing.
    (4) As of the date of the acknowledgment, executed by the Director, 
Finance Office, on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 471-7 the Director, Finance Office, will transfer the insured 
note from the assignor to the assignee as the insured holder on the 
records of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The 
name and address of the assignee will be recorded by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 exactly as they appear on Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 471-7.
    (5) Payments transmitted by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 on or after the acknowledgment date shown on Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 471-7 will be 
transmitted to the assignee. The Director, Finance Office, will give 
notice to the assignor and the assignee of any payments transmitted by 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to the assignor 
before the acknowledgment date and after either the date of sale, or the 
date of the statement of account, whichever is earlier. However, FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not be liable for any 
failure to give such notice.

    (c) Assignment of insured notes to FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354--(1) Assignment at the request of the holder. 
For assignment of an insured note to FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 during the option period at the request of the 
holder, the following procedure will apply:
    (i) The holder will endorse the insured note as follows: ``Pay to 
the order of the United States of America. Without recourse.'' The 
holder will then deliver the endorsed note, together with the insurance 
agreement, to the Director, Finance Office.
    (ii) On receipt of the endorsed note with the accompanying insurance 
agreement, the Director, Finance Office, will acknowledge receipt of the 
note and process payment to the assignor of the par value of the note as 
of the date of the Treasury check.
    (2) Assignment at the request of FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354. The procedure for assigning an insured note at the 
request of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be 
the same as that prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except 
that the Director, Finance Office, will send a written request to the 
holder requiring that the insured note be assigned to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and delivered to the Director, 
Finance Office, with the accompanying insurance agreement. The Director, 
Finance Office, will explain that the assignment is necessary to enable 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to service the 
account properly and will give the holder all necessary information as 
to the manner of making the assignment and the amount to be paid by FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (d) Replacement of called or fully paid notes. Certain insurance 
endorsements contain a clause or rider providing for a replacement note 
when the original note is paid in full, or is called by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354. This provision applies to 
loans sold for a fixed period of 10 years or longer for loans sold on or 
after December 1, 1969, and a fixed period of 15 years or longer for 
loans sold before December 1, 1969. If a note is paid in full or called 
by the Government and the lender is entitled to a replacement note, the 
lender may obtain a certificate of beneficial ownership in lieu of the 
replacement note. The certificate will carry the rates and terms 
applicable to the replacement note.
    (e) Death of a noteholder. The Finance Office should be notified of 
the death of a holder of an insured note. The following documents should 
be forwarded with the notice if available:
    (1) A certified copy of the death certificate.
    (2) A certified copy of the court order appointing the Administrator 
or Executor (include the mailing address of the Administrator or 
Executor). The Finance Office will notify the person submitting the 
notice and/or documentation if any other records or documents are 
needed, and will provide any additional instructions that are needed. 
Legal opinions and advice will be obtained by the Finance Office as 
needed from the Regional Attorney.


<R05>
Sec. 1901.509  Loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of insured notes, insurance contracts, and certificates of beneficial ownership.

    (a) Block sale insurance contracts. The Associate Administrator is 
authorized in connection with block sale insurance contracts to 
authorize the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's 
fiscal agent to establish requirements for issuance of a replacement 
insurance contract when the original issued by the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York (FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's 
fiscal agent) is lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced. When a 
block sale insurance contract is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a duplicate 
may be issued to the registered holder upon receipt of an acceptable 
certificate of loss and an indemnity bond without surety. The 
certificate of loss should include the legal name and present address of 
the owner and address when issued, if different from the present 
address; the capacity of person certifying, if other than owner; the 
identity of the insurance contract, including series number, contract 
number, denomination, issue date, and form of inscription of registry, 
and the full statement of

[[Page 57]]

circumstances of loss. All available portions of an insurance contract 
that is mutilated, defaced, or partially destroyed should be submitted 
to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354's fiscal agent) for determination as to whether 
a duplicate insurance contract can be issued without a certificate of 
loss and posting of an indemnity bond. In the event the holder of a 
block sales insurance contract obtains possession of the underlying 
notes, the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply.
    (b) Notes and certificates of beneficial ownership sold by County 
Office and Finance Office. The Director, or the insured loan officer of 
the Finance Office, is authorized on behalf of the Government, in 
connection with insured notes or certificates of beneficial ownership 
sold through the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Finance Office to require indemnity bonds from a noteholder when a note 
or certificate is lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced while 
in the custody of the holder or his designee. When a note or certificate 
of beneficial ownership is lost, stolen, or destroyed while in the 
custody of the holder or his designee, the following will apply:
    (1) A certificate of loss should be filed with FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office. The certificate should 
include:
    (i) Legal name and present address of owner when issued, if 
different from present address.
    (ii) Capacity of person certifying, if other than the owner.
    (iii) Identity of the note or certificate of beneficial ownership, 
including the name and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 case number of the maker thereof, issue date, interest rate of 
obligation, face amount of note or certificate of beneficial ownership, 
and a full description of any assignment, endorsement, or any other 
writing.
    (iv) A full statement of circumstances of the loss, theft, or 
destruction of the note.
    (2) An indemnity bond in the amount of the unpaid principal and 
interest will be required except in the following instances:
    (i) Substantially the entire note or certificate of beneficial 
ownership is presented and surrendered by the owner or holder, and the 
Director, Finance Office, is satisfied as to the identity of the 
instruments and that any missing portions are not sufficient to form the 
basis of a valid claim against the United States or the borrower; or
    (ii) The owner or holder is the United States, a Federal Reserve 
Bank, a Federal Government Corporation, a State or territory, or the 
District of Columbia.
    (3) An indemnity bond without surety will be provided in the 
following cases:
    (i) Cases involving registered unassigned obligations held by banks, 
trust companies, savings and loan associations, or companies holding 
certificates of authority from Secretary of the Treasury as acceptable 
sureties on Federal Bonds (companies listed on Treasury Department 
Circular 570) where the financial responsibilities of such claimants are 
well known or readily ascertainable.
    (ii) Cases involving registered unassigned obligations where the 
evidence reasonably justifies a conclusion that the obligations were 
destroyed and the unpaid principal and interest amount does not exceed 
$1,000.
    (4) An indemnity posted with a qualified surety is required in all 
cases involving registered unassigned obligations other than those cited 
in paragraphs (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this 
section. A qualified surety is a company holding a certificate of 
authority from the Secretary of the Treasury as acceptable sureties on 
Federal Bonds, and listed in Treasury Department Circular 570.
    (5) All indemnity bonds for notes must be payable to both the 
borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. All 
indemnity bonds for certificates of beneficial ownership must be payable 
to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The bond may 
be posted at the time the note or certificate of beneficial ownership 
becomes eligible for repurchase by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354. If the holder desires to continue to hold the

[[Page 58]]

note for the life of the note, an indemnity bond will not be required.
    (6) An assignment of the note or certificate of beneficial ownership 
shall be made to the United States of America, acting through the 
Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354, United States Department of Agriculture. An acceptable form of 
assignment is available from the Director, Finance Office.
    (c) Other cases. Cases involving bearer obligations and other cases 
not discussed in this section will be forwarded to the Director, Finance 
Office, for requirements.
    (d) Replacement of notes. FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 will not attempt to obtain replacement notes from borrowers.

<R05>
Sec. 1902.1  General.

    This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures of the Farmers 
Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 for disbursement of funds under the Loan Disbursement System (LDS), 
in establishing and using supervised bank accounts, and in placing 
Multi-Family Housing (MFH) reserve accounts in supervised bank accounts. 
The LDS system provides for disbursement of funds on an as needed basis 
to substantially reduce interest costs to FmHA or its successor agency

<R05>
Sec. 1902.2  Policies concerning disbursement of funds.

    (a) The Automated Data Processing System (ADPS) will be utilized 
whenever possible in accordance with the specific program procedures, 
except where prohibited by State statutes. The capability to request 
Treasury checks on an as needed basis reduces the need for supervised 
bank accounts. Therefore, supervised bank accounts will be used only in 
certain instances. e.g.:
    (1) When a construction loan is made and the construction is 
substantially completed, but a small amount is being withheld pending 
completion of landscaping or some similar item, or a small loan closing. 
In this case, the amount of funds not disbursed when the predetermined 
amortization effective date occurs may be placed in a supervised bank 
account for future disbursement as appropriate.
    (2) When a large number of checks will be issued in the construction 
of a dwelling or other development, as for example under the ``borrower 
method'' of construction or in Operating (OL) loans and Emergency (EM) 
loans. In such cases, installment checks will be requested from the 
Finance Office as necessary and deposited in a supervised bank account 
and disbursed to suppliers, sub-contractors, etc., as necessary. Those 
District and County Offices authorized to request checks by the ADPS may 
request more than one check at a time. If more than one check is 
required, a Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
440-57 or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-57 will be prepared for each check.
    (3) Association loan and grant funds made on a multiple advance 
basis need not be deposited in a supervised bank account unless required 
by State statutes or otherwise determined necessary by the Loan Approval 
Official.
    (4) Supervised bank accounts will be used only when needed as 
defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section to assure the correct 
expenditures of all or a part of loan and grant funds, borrower 
contributions, and borrower income. Such accounts will be limited in 
amount and duration to the extent feasible through the prudent 
disbursement of funds and the prompt termination of the interests of 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and other lenders 
when the accounts are no longer required.
    (5) Income from the sale of security or Economic Opportunity (EO) 
property or the proceeds from insurance on such property will be 
deposited in a supervised bank account under Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 402-1 when the District Director or 
County Supervisor determines it is needed as defined in paragraph (a)(6) 
of this section to assure that the funds will be available for 
replacement of the property.
    (6) When it is determined by the County Supervisor and requested or 
agreed to by the borrower that special supervision is needed in the 
management of the borrower's financial affairs, funds may be deposited 
in a supervised bank account. This supervisory technique will be used 
for a temporary period to help the borrower learn to properly manage 
his/her financial affairs. Such a period will not exceed one year unless 
extended by the District Director.
    (7) In exceptional cases when the unincorporated EO cooperative or 
grazing association borrower cannot obtain a position fidelity bond, its 
income may be deposited as provided for in Sec. 1902.6 (and 
Sec. 1902.2(f) of this subpart if another lender is involved).
    (b) For all construction loans and those loans using multiple 
advances, only the actual amount to be disbursed at loan closing will be 
requested through the State Office terminal. Subsequent checks will be 
ordered as needed through the ADPS system.
    (c) Program instructions provide information as to the type of note 
to be utilized and the method of handling advances and the interest 
accrued thereon. For individual loan programs, interest will accrue from 
the loan closing

[[Page 62]]

date or date of check whichever is later. For association and 
organization type loans interest will accrue from the date the check is 
delivered to the borrower. For all RRH, RCH, LH or RHS loans, interest 
will accrue from the date of the check.
    (d) For all loan accounts, when the total amount has not been 
advanced at the amortization effective date, as defined in the FMI for 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1940-1, (and 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-51, for 
multiple family housing), the Finance Office will forward the remaining 
balance to the District Director or County Supervisor for appropriate 
action, unless the District Director or County Supervisor notifies the 
Finance Office of other arrangements.
    (e) When a check cannot be negotiated within 20 working days from 
the date of the check, the District Director or County Supervisor will 
process the check(s) with Form(s) FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1940-10, ``Cancellation of U.S. Treasury Check and/or 
Obligation,'' (or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1944-53, ``Multiple Family Housing Cancellation of U.S. Treasury 
Check and/or Obligation,'' for multiple family housing loans) in 
accordance with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Instruction 2018-D (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 office).
    (f) The debt instruments executed at the time of loan closing 
constitute an obligation on the part of the Government to disburse all 
funds at one time or in multiple advances provided the funds are for 
purposes authorized by the Government at the time of loan closing. This 
obligatory commitment takes priority over any intervening liens or 
advances by other creditors regardless of the provisions of the State 
laws involved.

Sec. 1902.3  Procedures to follow in fund disbursement.

    (a) The District Director or County Supervisor will determine during 
loan approval the amount(s) of loan check(s)--full or partial--and 
forward such request to be processed through the ADPS system.
    (b) When check(s) are delivered to the District or County Office, 
the District Director or County Supervisor will make sure that the name 
of the borrower and the amount(s) of check(s) coincide with the request 
on file. The District Director or County Supervisor should be sure that 
the check is properly endorsed to insure payment to the intended 
recipient. Examples of such restrictive endorsements are:
    (1) ``For Deposit only to Account No. (Number of Construction 
Account) of (Name of Borrower) in (Name of Financial Institution).''
    (2) ``Pay to the order of (3rd party payee)''--(Contractor, 
Developer, Sub-Contractor, Building Supply House, etc.) for the purpose 
of __________.
    (c) When necessary and only under the circumstances listed in 
Sec. 1902.2 the District Director or County Supervisor will establish, 
or cause to be established, a supervised bank account. Funds deposited 
in a supervised bank account are to be recorded and accounted for on 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 402.2, 
``Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals.''

Sec. 1902.4  Establishing MFH reserve accounts in a supervised bank account.

    (a) General requirements. All MFH borrowers required to maintain 
reserve accounts must place the reserve accounts in a supervised bank 
account(s) which meets the following requirements:
    (1) Countersignature requirements. The reserve account must require 
that any funds withdrawn be countersigned by an authorized FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official.

[[Page 63]]

    (2) Restrictions on collateral. The financial institution holding 
the reserve account must ensure that the funds are not pledged or taken 
as security without the Agency's prior consent.
    (3) Interest bearing. The reserve account funds are encouraged to be 
maintained in an interest-bearing account. The ``Interest-Bearing 
Deposit Agreement'' set out in exhibit B of this subpart is not required 
to be used for reserve accounts.
    (4) Restricted investments. Reserve funds must be placed in 
investments authorized in subpart C of part 1930 of this chapter. The 
authorized investments are deemed to be of acceptable risk such that the 
potential for any loss is minimal.
    (5) Financial institutions. The reserve account must be maintained 
in authorized financial institutions set out in subpart C of part 1930 
of this chapter (e.g., banks, savings and loan institutions, credit 
unions, brokerage firms, mutual funds, etc.). Generally, any financial 
institution may be used provided invested or deposited funds are insured 
to protect against theft and dishonesty. The reserve account funds need 
not be Federally insured. However, if Federally insured, any amount held 
above the Federal insurance ceilings established must be backed by a 
pledge of collateral from the financial institution, or otherwise 
covered by non-federal insurance against theft and dishonesty.
    (6) Rules where multiple projects are involved. A reserve account(s) 
must be maintained for each borrower. When a borrower owns multiple 
projects, reserve accounts may be established for each project. A single 
reserve account may also be established by a borrower owning multiple 
projects, provided the conditions set out in subpart C of part 1930 of 
this chapter are met.
    (7) Term. Reserve accounts are expected to be kept for the full term 
of the loan.
    (b) Deposits and account activity statements--(1) Deposits. 
Generally, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
will not require the review or approval of deposits or the use of Forms 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 402-1 or FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 402-2.
    (2) Account activity statements. Generally, the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not monitor or reconcile 
the reserve account activity statements issued periodically by the 
financial institutions holding the funds. FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 will monitor reserve account levels through 
budget reports, audits, and Agency reserve tracking systems. If disputes 
arise or the borrower is in violation of Agency regulations, the Agency 
may require account activity statements. When account activity 
statements are sought, it will normally be sufficient to obtain the 
statement which reflects balances as of the last activity statement 
ending period. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 402-2 is not required to be used.

<R05>
Sec. 1902.6  Establishing supervised bank accounts.

    (a) Each borrower will be given an opportunity to choose the 
financial institution in which the supervised bank account will be 
established, provided the bank is a member of the FDIC, the savings and 
loan is a member of the FSLIC, and the credit union is a member of the 
NCUA.
    (b) When accounts are established, it should be determined that:
    (1) The financial institution is fully informed concerning the 
provisions of the applicable deposit agreement,
    (2) Agreements are reached with respect to the services to be 
provided by the financial institution including the frequency and method 
of transmittal of checking account statements, and
    (3) Agreement is reached with the financial institution regarding 
the place where the counter-signature will be on checks.
    (c) When possible, District Directors or County Supervisors will 
make arrangements with financial institutions to waive service charges 
in connection

[[Page 64]]

with supervised bank accounts. However, there is no objection to the 
payment by the borrower of a reasonable charge for such service.
    (d) For each borrower, if the amounts of any loan and grant funds, 
plus any borrower contributions and funds from other sources to be 
deposited in the supervised bank account will exceed $100,000, the 
financial institution will be required to pledge collateral for the 
excess over $100,000, before the deposit is made (see Sec. 1902.7).
    (e) Only one supervised bank account will be established for any 
borrower regardless of the amount or source of funds, except for RRH 
loans where separate accounts will be established for each project.
    (f) When a supervised bank account is established, an original and 
two copies of the applicable Deposit Agreement and the Interest-Bearing 
Deposit Agreement (Exhibit B), when applicable, will be executed by the 
borrower, the financial institution, and a District or County Office 
employee. The original will be retained in the borrower's case file, one 
executed copy will be delivered to the financial institution and one 
executed copy to the borrower. An extra copy of the Interest-Bearing 
Deposit Agreement, when applicable, will be prepared and attached to the 
certificate, passbook, or other evidence of deposit representing the 
interest-bearing deposit.
    (1) If an agreement on the applicable Deposit Agreement has 
previously been executed and Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 402-6, ``Termination of Interest in Supervised Bank 
Account,'' has not been executed with respect to it, a new agreement is 
not required when additional funds are to be deposited unless requested 
by the financial institution.
    (2) When the note and security instrument are signed by two joint 
borrowers or by both husband and wife, a joint survivorship supervised 
bank account will be established from which either can withdraw funds if 
State laws permit such accounts. In such cases both parties will sign 
the Deposit Agreement(s).

Sec. 1902.7  Pledging collateral for deposit of funds in supervised bank accounts.

    (a) Funds in excess of $100,000, per financial institution, 
deposited for borrowers in supervised bank accounts, must be secured by 
pledging acceptable collateral with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in an 
amount not less than the excess.
    (b) As soon as it is determined that the loan will be approved and 
the applicant has selected or tentatively selected a financial 
institution for the supervised bank account, the District Director or 
County Supervisor will contact the financial institution to determine:
    (1) That the financial institution selected is insured by the FDIC 
(banks), FSLIC (savings and loans), or NCUA (credit unions).
    (2) Whether the financial institution is willing to pledge 
collateral with the FRB under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176) to 
the extent necessary to secure the amount of funds being deposited in 
excess of $100,000.
    (3) If the financial institution is not a member of the Federal 
Reserve System, it will be necessary for the financial institution to 
pledge the securities with a correspondent bank who is a member of the 
System. The correspondent bank should contact the FRB informing them 
they are holding securities pledged for the supervised bank account 
under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176).
    (c) If the financial institution is agreeable to pledging 
collateral, the District Director or County Supervisor should complete 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Form Letter 1901-
A-2 ``Designated Financial Institution--Collateral Pledge'' in an 
original and two copies, the original for the National Office, the first 
copy for the State Office, and the second copy for the District or 
County Office. The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Form Letter 1902-A-2 should be forwarded to the National Office at least 
30 days before the date of loan closing.
    (d) The National Office will arrange for the financial institution 
under its

[[Page 65]]

designation as a depositary and financial agent of the U.S. Government 
to pledge the requested collateral.
    (e) If, two days before loan closing, the local FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office which requested the 
collateral has not received notification from National Office that 
collateral has been pledged, contact should be made with the financial 
institution to ascertain whether they have pledged collateral with their 
local FRB under 31 CFR part 202 (Treasury Circular 176). If the 
financial institution has pledged collateral, the local FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office should contact the 
National Office, Budget Division, Revolving Fund Analysis Branch who 
will follow-up with the local FRB concerning the collateral.
    (f) When the amount of deposit in the supervised bank account has 
been reduced to a point where the financial institution desires part or 
all of the collateral released, it should contact the National Office at 
the address noted above. The local FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 office will be contacted for release authorization. 
The authorization release will be made through the local FRB, with 
notification to the financial institution. The local FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office may also request 
release through the National Office.

<R05>
Sec. 1902.8  Authority to establish supervised bank accounts, deposit loan checks and other funds, countersign checks, close accounts, and execute all forms in 
          connection with supervised bank account transactions.

    District Directors or County Supervisors are authorized to establish 
supervised bank accounts, deposit loan checks and other funds, 
countersign checks, close accounts, and execute all forms in connection 
with supervised bank account transactions and redelegate this authority 
to a person listed in exhibit B of FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1951-B, under their supervision who are 
considered capable of exercising such authority. State Directors will 
make written demand upon the bank for withdrawals as outlined in 
Sec. 1902.16.


<R05>
Sec. 1902.9  Deposits.

    (a) Deposit by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
personnel. (1) Checks made payable solely to the Federal Government, or 
any agency thereof, and a joint check when the Treasurer of the United 
States is a joint payee, may not be deposited in a supervised bank 
account.
    (2) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel 
will accept funds for deposit in a borrower's supervised bank account 
only in the form of a check or money order endorsed by the borrower 
``For Deposit Only,'' or a check drawn to the order of the financial 
institution in which the funds are to be deposited, or a loan check 
drawn on the U.S. Treasury.
    (i) A joint check that is payable to the borrower and FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be endorsed by the 
District Director or County Supervisor as provided in Sec. 1951.57(e) of 
this chapter.
    (ii) Ordinarily, when deposits are made from funds which are 
received as the result of consent or subordination agreements or 
assignments of income, the check should be drawn to the order of the 
financial institution in which the supervised bank account is 
established or jointly to the order of the borrower and the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354. All such checks should be 
delivered or mailed to the District or County Office.
    (3) If direct or insured loan funds (other than OL or EM, loan 
funds) or borrower contributions are to be deposited in a supervised 
bank account, such funds will be deposited on the date of loan closing 
after it has been determined that the loan can be closed. However, if it 
is impossible to deposit the funds on the day the loan is closed due to 
reasons such as distance from the financial institution or banking 
hours, the funds will be deposited on the first banking day following 
the date of loan closing.
    (4) Grant funds will be deposited when such funds are delivered.

[[Page 66]]

    (5) When funds from any source are deposited by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel in a supervised bank 
account, a deposit slip will be prepared in an original and two copies 
and distribution as follows: Original to the financial institution, one 
copy to the borrower, and one copy for the borrower's case folder. The 
names of the borrower, the sources of funds, and ``Subject to FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Countersignature,'' and if 
applicable, the account number will be entered on each deposit slip.
    (6) A loan or grant check drawn on the U.S. Treasury may be 
deposited in a supervised bank account without endorsement by the 
borrower when it will facilitate delivery of the check and is acceptable 
to the financial institution. The borrower will be notified immediately 
of any deposit made and will be furnished a copy of the deposit slip. 
When a deposit of this nature is made, the following endorsement will be 
used:

    For deposit only in the supervised bank account of (name of 
borrower) in the (name of financial institution and address when 
necessary for identification) pursuant to Deposit Agreement dated 
________.

    (7) Accounts established through the use of Interest-Bearing Deposit 
Agreement will be in the name of the depositor and the Government.
    (b) Deposits by borrowers. Funds in any form may be deposited in the 
supervised bank account by the borrower if authorized by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 provided the financial 
institution has agreed that when a deposit in made to the account by 
other than FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
personnel, the financial institution will promptly deliver or mail a 
copy of the deposit slip to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 District or County Office.
    (1) A loan or grant check drawn on the U.S. Treasury may be 
deposited in a supervised bank account by a borrower, provided the 
following endorsement is used and is inserted thereon prior to delivery 
to the borrower for signature:

    For deposit only in my supervised bank account in the (name of 
financial institution and address when necessary for identification) 
pursuant to Deposit Agreement dated ________.

    (2) Funds other than loan or grant funds may be deposited by the 
borrower in those exceptional instances where an agreement is reached 
between the District Director or County Supervisor and the borrower, 
whereby the borrower will make deposits of income from any source 
directly into the supervised bank account. In such instances the 
borrower will be instructed to prepare the deposit slip in the manner 
described in Sec. 1902.9(a)(5).


<R05>
Sec. 1902.10  Withdrawals.

    (a) The District Director or County Supervisor will not countersign 
checks on the supervised bank account for the use of funds unless the 
funds deposited by the borrower from other sources were cash deposits, 
or checks which the District Director or County Supervisor knows to be 
good, or until the deposit checks have cleared.
    (b) Withdrawals of funds deposited under the applicable deposit 
agreement are permitted only by order of the borrower and 
countersignature of authorized FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 personnel, or upon written demand on the financial 
institution by the State Director.
    (c) Upon withdrawal or maturity of interest-bearing accounts 
established through the use of an Interest-Bearing Deposit Agreement, 
such funds will be credited to the supervised bank account established 
through the use of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 402-1.
    (d) The issuance of checks on the supervised bank account will be 
kept to the minimum possible without defeating the purpose of such 
accounts. When major items of capital goods are being purchased, or a 
limited number of relatively costly items of operating expenses are 
being paid, or when debts are being refinanced, the checks will be drawn 
to the vendors or creditors. If minor capital items are being purchased 
or numerous items of operating and family living expenses are involved 
as in connection with a monthly budget, a check may be drawn to the 
borrower to provide the funds to meet such costs.

[[Page 67]]

    (1) A check will be issued payable to the appropriate payee but will 
never be issued to ``cash.'' The purpose of the expenditure will be 
clearly shown on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 402-2 and indicated on the fact of the check. When checks are drawn 
in favor of the borrower to cover items too numerous to identify, the 
expenditure will be identified on the check, as ``miscellaneous.''
    (2) Normally, OL and EM loan funds will not be withdrawn from the 
supervised bank account until the lien search has been made and a 
determination reached that the required security has been obtained. This 
applies also to withdrawal of funds in secured individual loan cases. 
However, in those instances when the applicant is unable to pay for the 
lien search and filing fees from personal funds, a check for this 
purpose may be drawn on the supervised bank account to meet these loan 
making requirements.
    (3) Ordinarily, a check will be countersigned before it is delivered 
to the payee. However, in justifiable circumstances such as when 
excessive travel on the part of the borrower, District Director of 
County Supervisor would be involved, or purchase would be prevented, and 
the borrower can be relied upon to select goods and services in 
accordance with the plans, a check may be delivered to the payee by the 
borrower before being countersigned.
    (i) When a check is to be delivered to the payee before being 
countersigned, the District Director or County Supervisor must make it 
clear to the borrower and to the payee, if possible, that the check will 
be countersigned only if the quantity and quality of items purchased are 
in accordance with approved plans.
    (ii) Checks delivered to the payee before countersignature will bear 
the following legend in addition to the legend for countersignature: 
``Valid only upon countersignature of Farmers Home Administration or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354.''
    (iii) The check must be presented by the payee or a representative 
to the District or County Office of the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 servicing the account for the required 
countersignature.
    (iv) Such check must be accompanied by a bill of sale, invoice, or 
receipt signed by the borrower identifying the nature and cost of goods 
or services purchased or similar information must be indicated on the 
check.
    (4) For real estate loans or grants, whether the check is delivered 
to the payee before or after countersignature, the number, and date of 
the check will be inserted on all bills of sale, invoices, receipts, and 
itemized statements for materials, equipment, and services.
    (5) Bills of sale, and so forth, may be returned to the borrower 
with the canceled check for the payment of the bill.
    (6) Checks to be drawn on a supervised bank account will bear the 
legend:

Countersigned, not as co-maker or endorser.

cancelled check or either a microfilm copy or other reasonable facsimile 
of the cancelled check must be provided to the District or County Office 
with the statement. Checking account statements will be reconciled 
promptly with District or County Office records. The person making the 
reconciliation will initial the record and indicate the date of the 
action.
    (b) All checking account statements and, if necessary, original 
cancelled checks or either a microfilm copy or other reasonable 
fascimile of the cancelled checks will be forwarded immediately to the 
borrower when bank statements and District or County Office records are 
in agreement. If a transmittal is used, Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 140-4, ``Transmittal of Documents,'' is 
prescribed for that purpose.
    (c) If the Financial Institution did not return the original 
cancelled check(s) to the Agency with the statements, and FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has a need for the original 
cancelled check(s) the Financial Institution, upon request by the 
Agency, will furnish to the Agency the requested original cancelled 
check(s) or a certified microfilmed copy or other reasonable certified 
facsimile of the cancelled check(s) and will provide this service to the 
Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 with no fees being assessed the Agency or the Depositor's

Sec. 1902.15  Closing accounts.

    When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan or 
grant funds and those of any other lender or grantor have all been 
properly expended or withdrawn, Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 402-6 may be used to give FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354's consent (and of another lender or 
grantor, if involved) to close the supervised bank account in the 
following situations:
    (a) When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan 
funds in the supervised bank account of a borrower have been reduced to 
$100 or less, and a check for the unexpended balance has been issued to 
the borrower to be used for authorized purposes.
    (b) For all loans accounts, except loans listed in Sec. 1902.15(c) 
of this section, after completion of authorized loan funds expenditures, 
and after promptly refunding any remaining unexpended loan funds on the 
borrower's loan account with FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 or another lender, as appropriate.
    (c) For Community Facility, Water and Waste Disposal, Indian Land 
Acquisition, Watershed (WS), Organizational Rural Rental Housing (RRH), 
Resource Conservation and Development (RCD), EO loans to a Cooperative 
Association, Rural Cooperative Housing (RCH), or Organizational Labor 
Housing (LH) loan and grant accounts, when the funds have been expended 
in accordance with the requirements of part 1942 subpart A, the 
supervised bank account will be closed within 90 days following 
completion of development, unless an extension of time is authorized in 
writing by the District Director. If the borrower will not agree to 
close the account, the District Director or County Supervisor will 
request the State Director to make demand upon the financial institution 
in accordance with Sec. 1902.16.
    (d) Promptly upon death of a borrower, except when the loan is being 
continued with a joint debtor, when a borrower is in default and it is 
determined that no further assistance will be given, or when a borrower 
is no longer classified as ``active.''
    (1) Deceased borrowers. (i) Ordinarily, upon notice of the death of 
a borrower, the District Director or the County Supervisor will request 
the State Director to make demand upon the bank for the balance on 
deposit and apply all the balance after payment of any bank charges to 
the borrower's FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
indebtedness. When the State Director approves continuation with a 
survivor, the supervised bank account of deceased borrower may be 
continued

[[Page 69]]

with a remaining joint debtor who is liable for the loan and agrees to 
use the unexpended funds as planned, provided:
    (A) The account is a joint survivorship supervised bank account, or
    (B) If not a joint survivorship account, the financial institution 
will agree to permit the addition of the surviving joint debtor's name 
to the existing signature card and the appropriate Deposit Agreement and 
continue to disburse checks out of the existing account upon FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354's countersignature and the 
joint debtor's signature in place of the deceased borrower, or
    (C) The financial institution will permit the State Director to 
withdraw the balance from the existing supervised bank account with a 
check jointly payable to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 and the surviving joint debtor and deposit the money in a 
new supervised bank account with a surviving joint debtor, and will 
disburse checks from this new account upon the signature of such 
survivor and the countersignature of an authorized FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 official.
    (ii) The State Director, before applying the balance remaining in 
the supervised bank account to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 indebtedness, is authorized upon approval by the 
Office of the General Counsel (OGC) to refund any unobligated balances 
of funds from other lenders to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 borrower for specific operating purposes in 
accordance with subordination agreements or other arrangements between 
the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the lender 
and the borrower.
    (iii) The State Director, upon the recommendation of an authorized 
representative of the estate of the deceased borrower and the approval 
of the OGC, is authorized to approve the use of deposited funds for the 
payment of commitments for goods delivered or services performed in 
accordance with the deceased borrower's plans approved by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (2) Borrowers in default. Whenever it is impossible or impractical 
to obtain a signed check from a borrower whose supervised bank account 
is to be closed, the District Director or County Supervisor will request 
the State Director to make demand upon the financial institution for the 
balance on deposit in the borrower's supervised bank account for 
application as appropriate:
    (i) To the borrower's FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 indebtedness, or
    (ii) As refunds of any unobligated advance provided by other lenders 
which were deposited in the account, or
    (iii) For the return of FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 grant funds to the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 Finance Office, or
    (iv) For the return of grant funds to other grantors.
    (3) Inactive borrowers. An inactive borrower is one whose loan has 
not been paid in full, but is no longer classified as ``active.''
    (4) Paid up borrowers. A paid-up borrower is one who has a balance 
remaining in the supervised bank account and has repaid the entire 
indebtedness to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
and has properly expended all funds advanced by other lenders. In such 
cases the District Director or County Supervisor will (i) notify the 
borrower in writing that the interests in the account of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 have been terminated, and (ii) 
inform the borrower of the balance remaining in the supervised bank 
account.

Sec. 1910.1  General.

    This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures for informing 
interested parties of the Farm Credit loan programs available through 
the Farm Service Agency (FSA), and how such requests are processed. 
Requests for Nonprogram (NP) assistance will be handled in accordance 
with subpart J of part 1951 of this chapter. References contained herein 
to the housing programs of the Rural Housing Service (RHS), or its 
successor agency, are no longer applicable.
    (a) The County Supervisor will provide information about FSA and RHS 
services to all persons making inquiry about FSA and RHS programs. This 
information may be provided by individual interviews, correspondence, or 
distribution of pamphlets, leaflets, and appropriate FSA and RHS 
regulations.
    (b) Wherever the term ``applicant'' appears in this subpart, it 
shall be construed to mean applicant and/or co-applicant, if any.
    (c) FmHA forms are available in any Rural Development (RD) or FSA 
office.
    (d) The terms ``interest credit'' and ''interest credit 
assistance,'' as they relate to Single Family Housing (SFH), are 
interchangeable with the term ``payment assistance.'' Payment assistance 
is the generic term for the subsidy provided to eligible SFH borrowers 
to reduce mortgage payments.
    (e) As used in this subpart in relation to Farm Credit Programs 
loans, Agency means the Farm Service Agency, its county and State 
committees and their personnel, and any successor agency.

Sec. 1910.2  Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B.

    ECOA as amended, prohibits discrimination in credit based on sex, 
marital status, race, color, religion, natural origin, age (provided the 
applicant has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the 
applicant's income is derived from public assistance of any kind, or 
because the applicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the 
Consumer Credit Protection Act. These shall hereafter be referred to in 
this subpart as ``ECOA prohibited bases.'' It is the policy of the 
Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 that assistance and services shall not be denied to any person 
or applicant as a result of race, sex, national origin, color, religion, 
marital status, age, receipt of income from public assistance, or 
because the applicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the 
Consumer Credit Protection Act.


<R05>
Sec. 1910.3  Receiving applications.

    Applications for FSA or RHS assistance will ordinarily be filed in 
the

[[Page 73]]

County Office serving the area in which the farm, dwelling, business, or 
other facility for which financing is being requested is or will be 
located.
    (a) All persons applying for FSA or RHS assistance who are not 
indebted to FSA or RHS must file a written application. All persons 
wishing to submit an application will be encouraged to do so. No oral or 
written statement will be made to applicants or prospective applicants 
that would discourage them from applying for assistance, based on any 
ECOA ``prohibited bases.'' The filing of written applications will be 
encouraged even though funds may not be currently available, since 
complete applications must be considered in the date order received, 
except when program regulations or Veteran status provides for 
preference. Applications will normally be handled as follows:
    (1) Form FmHA 410-4, ``Application for Rural Housing Assistance 
(NonFarm Tract),'' will be used by applicants for RH loans on nonfarm 
tracts who depend primarily on off-farm income.
    (2) Form FmHA 410-1, ``Application for FmHA Services,'' will be used 
by all other applicants. These include persons applying for RH loans on 
farms or nonfarm tracts who derive a major portion of their income from 
farming. For EM loans, it is also necessary for the applicant to 
complete Form FmHA 1945-22, ``Certification of Disaster Losses.''
    (3) SF 424.2, ``Application for Federal Assistance (For 
Construction),'' with the requirements outlined in the applicable 
program exhibits will be used by all applicants applying for LH loans.
    (4) The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, Title XI of Pub. L. 
95-630, requires that:
    (i) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, 
within 3 days of the receipt of an application for a loan or grant from 
an individual or a partnership of five or fewer members, the RD office 
will forward Form FmHA 410-7, ``Notification to Applicant on Use of 
Financial Information from Financial Institution,'' to those applicants.
    (ii) For a labor housing application filed by an individual or a 
partnership of five or fewer members, the RD office will comply with 
paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section only if it is determined that 
financial information will be requested from any financial institution.
    (5) All individual loan applicants will sign Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 410-9, ``Statement Required by 
the Privacy Act.'' A signed copy will remain with the application. No 
application is complete without a signed Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 410-9 on file.
    (6) Information regarding race, national origin, sex, and marital 
status is needed for monitoring purposes for all applications filed for 
assistance to finance residential real estate and direct FO loans when 
the loan is to be secured by a lien on the property. In those cases, 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will request the 
applicant and/or co-applicant to furnish that information on the 
application on a voluntary basis. The application form will indicate 
that this information is provided on a voluntary basis.
    (7) Applicants are asked to identify any known relationship or 
association with an FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 employee when completing the application. When there is a 
relationship or association, the processing official must complete the 
action required under subpart D of part 1900 of this chapter.
    (b) Requests by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 borrowers for additional assistance will be submitted as prescribed 
by each loan/grant program, and the following:
    (1) All applicants must provide their taxpayer's identification 
number with their applications, except as noted in paragraph (i) of this 
section.
    (2) RH applicants who have a current Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944--3, ``Budget and/or Financial 
Statement'', or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 410-4, and who are presently indebted to FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354, will be required to complete only the 
following items of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 410-4 (if other information about their current status is not 
available for adequate processing of their

[[Page 74]]

applications, these applicants should fully complete Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 410-4):
    (i) Name.
    (ii) Social Security Number.
    (iii) Loan purpose.
    (iv) Planned income for next 12 months.
    (v) Date and signature of the application.
    (3) Farmer Program applicants who are presently indebted to FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103- 354 will be required to 
complete Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 410-
1. When application is made within 60 days of the date of table A, 
``Balance sheet,'' on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 431-2, ``Farm and Home Plan,'' and there are no significant 
changes that would affect eligibility, reference to table A of Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 431-2 can be made in 
Item 17, ``Financial Statement as of Date of Application,'' of Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 410-1.
    (4) Applicants for EM loans with new losses from disaster, as 
authorized under EM regulations, must also complete Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1945-22 in addition to the 
other required forms.
    (c) County Office employees will be responsible for receiving loan 
applications and giving a preliminary explanation of services available 
through FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. An 
explanation of the types of assistance available should be given 
whenever it is not clear to the applicant what type of loan or grant 
will meet the applicant's needs. The employee receiving the application 
will make sure that it is properly completed, dated and signed, and will 
give whatever assistance is necessary. An applicant may apply for and 
maintain a loan account using a birth-given first name and a birth-given 
surname, or the spouse's surname, or a combination of surnames. Married 
persons may apply as individuals. In the case of a joint application for 
other than a farmer program loan, the persons requesting the assistance 
will designate who is listed as ``applicant'' and who is listed as ``co-
applicant.'' For farmer program loans, there will be only one applicant. 
If a husband and wife insist on applying as co-applicants for a farmer 
program loan and the farming operation is a sole proprietorship, they 
will be considered a joint operation and they both will have to meet the 
eligibility requirements applicable to the joint operation. County 
Office employees must explain to husbands and wives that they both do 
not need to apply for farmer program loans unless they desire to do so 
or the application is for an entity operation. If they apply together 
for a loan, it must be explained that they will be considered as a joint 
operation. When the use of veteran's preference is involved, the 
identity of the veteran must be properly documented if the name used in 
the application differs from that shown on the veteran's evidence of 
eligibility.
    (d) Information will be obtained about household members or others, 
including cosigners, as required by program regulations needed to 
determine eligibility for the requested assistance. A cosigner will be 
required only when it has been determined that the applicant cannot 
possibly meet the repayment or the security requirements for the loan 
request. When a co-signer will be required, the applicant will be 
requested to identify their choice of co-signer. An applicant will also 
be required to provide information concerning a co-signer, spouse or 
former spouse, who will not be a co-signer, or who is not a member of 
the household, when the applicant is relying on the co-signer, alimony, 
child support, separate maintenance from that spouse or former spouse as 
a basis for repayment, or receipt of such payments will be considered 
for eligibility. In such cases, information regarding the co-signer's, 
spouse's or former spouse's financial resources may be requested. Only 
information regarding the receipt and dependability of income from 
alimony, child support, or separate maintenance, provided by a former 
spouse, may be requested, considered, and verified to determine 
eligibility and repayment ability.
    (e) Signature requirements on the Promissory Note will be as needed 
to

[[Page 75]]

assure repayment of the indebtedness and as set out in the loan making 
regulations. The spouse of an applicant will not be required to sign the 
note unless the spouse's signature on the note is required to create a 
security interest or the spouse is a co-applicant. Signature 
requirements on the Mortgage or Deed of Trust will be sufficient to 
obtain the required lien, and to make the property being offered as 
security available to satisfy the debt in the event of default. FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State supplements will be 
issued to outline the requirements in accordance with State real 
property law. The State Director will obtain the advice of OGC prior to 
issuance of the State supplement.
    (f) If a spouse's signature would be necessary for FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to obtain the necessary 
security, information regarding an applicant's marital status will be 
obtained. Only the terms ``married'' and ``separated'' may be used to 
designate marital status. ``Unmarried'' includes single, divorced, or 
widowed persons.
    (g) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may not 
request information concerning birth control practices, intentions 
concerning the bearing or rearing of children, or capability to bear 
children. Assumptions or aggregate statistics relating to the likelihood 
or probability that any particular group of persons will bear or rear 
children will not be used to evaluate creditworthiness, or for any other 
purpose; nor will the assumption be made that, for that reason, an 
applicant will receive diminished or interrupted income in the future.
    (h) If after discussing credit needs, it appears that the applicant 
may be able to obtain the necessary credit from some other source, the 
County Supervisor should provide information on the availability of such 
credit and provide the needed assistance in contacting that credit 
source. All applications, including those from applicants assisted in 
obtaining credit from other credit sources, will be listed and reported 
in accordance with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Instructions 1905-A and 2006-J which are available in all FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 offices.
    (i) For all loans and grants, the applicant must furnish the 
applicant's taxpayer's identification number with the application, 
except as otherwise indicated in this paragraph. The taxpayer's 
identification number for individuals who are not business applicants is 
the Social Security Number (SSN). The taxpayer's identification number 
will be used as part of the borrower's case number, except as noted in 
paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
    (1) The SSN preceded by the State and county code numbers will 
constitute the borrower's case number to be used on all FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 forms.
    (2) In the case of noncitizens who are permanent residents or on 
indefinite parole and who do not yet have a taxpayer's identification 
number, their applications will be filed; however, they will not be 
processed until the SSN is obtained. Disposition of applications not 
processed because of lack of the number will be as set forth in FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2033-A, 
``Management of County Office Records,'' (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (3) The borrower's case number for residents of the Pacific Islands 
will be taxpayer's identification number issued by the Pacific Islands 
Government.
    (j) For all loans and credit sales secured by a first mortgage and 
involving the purchase of an existing 1 to 4 family unit, or purchase of 
a building site and construction of 1 to 4 family residential units, or 
FO loans involving tracts of 25 acres or less, whether made to an 
individual, corporation, partnership, joint operation, cooperative, 
association, or other entity, the booklet entitled ``Settlement Costs'' 
will be hand-delivered to the applicant when the completed application 
is received, or mailed to the applicant within three (3) business days 
after receipt of the application in the County Office.
    (1) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440-
58,

[[Page 76]]

``Estimate of Settlement Costs,'' will be completed by the County 
Supervisor and delivered to the applicant with the booklet.
    (2) A record of the date and method of delivery of the booklet and 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 440-58 will 
be kept in the running record section of the applicant's/borrower's 
County Office case folder.
    (k) For loans, assumptions and credit sales to individuals for 
household purposes that are subject to the Real Estate Settlement 
Procedures Act (RESPA), Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1940-41, ``Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement,'' will be 
completed using ``good-faith'' estimates, and will be delivered or 
placed in the mail to the applicant within 3 business days of receipt of 
the written application in the County Office.
    (l) Fees for the total amount charged for individual credit reports 
as indicated in exhibit A of subpart B of part 1910 of this chapter 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office) will be collected from the loan applicants before credit reports 
are ordered, except in the case of section 504 loan applicants and 
section 502 Rural Housing Loan applicants whose requested loan will 
likely not exceed $7,500. It is the policy not to order credit reports 
for Rural Housing loans of $7,500, or less, but if the County Supervisor 
determines that a credit report is necessary, it will be ordered at no 
cost to the loan applicant as provided for in Sec. 1910.53(g) of subpart 
B of part 1910 of this chapter.

Sec. 1910.4  Processing applications.

    When obtaining information concerning applicants and evaluating 
their qualifications, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 personnel will be covered by the provisions of ECOA and the 
established policies for the various types of assistance offered by FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. If a farm is situated 
in more than one State, County or Parish, the loan will be processed in 
the State, County or Parish where the applicant's principal residence on 
the farm is located. If the applicant's residence is not located on the 
farm or if the applicant is a corporation, cooperative, partnership or 
joint operation, the loan will be processed by the County Office serving 
the County in which the farm or a major portion of the farm is located, 
unless otherwise approved by the State Office. Applications of FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employees, members of 
their families, close relatives, or business or close personal 
associates are processed according to subpart D of part 1900 of this 
chapter.
    (a) Completed RH applications. Completed applications are those as 
described in Sec. 1944.27 (copies available in any REDC office), and all 
applications for Rural Housing loans will be processed as outlines in 
that instruction.
    (b) Completed Farm Credit Programs applications and additional FSA 
responsibilities. All persons requesting an application will be provided 
exhibit A (available in any office). The County Supervisor will provide 
assistance as necessary to help applicants complete their applications. 
Complete applications will be processed in the order of date received, 
except as outlined in Sec. 1910.10 of this subpart. If the application 
is complete when it is first received, a County Office official will 
stamp the filing date on the front of Form FmHA 410-1 and enter the date 
in the ``Application Received'' and ``Application Completed'' fields in 
the Application Processing Module of the Management Records Systems 
(MRS.) On the date all information necessary to process an application 
is received, a County Office official will send the applicant FmHA Guide 
Letter 1910-A-3 (available in any office) notifying the applicant that 
the application is considered complete. The date entered in the 
``Application Completed'' field in the Application Processing Module of 
MRS will establish the 30-day and 60-day timeframes for determining 
eligibility and loan approval/disapproval, respectively. The County 
Supervisor will verify the information furnished

[[Page 77]]

by the applicant, and record and assemble additional information needed 
to properly evaluate the applicant's qualifications and credit needs. 
Additional information may be obtained and verified by County Office 
records, personal contacts, and visits to the applicant's operation. A 
complete Farm Credit Programs application requires fulfillment of both 
the applicant and FSA responsibilities. Once this information is 
received and the application is considered complete, FSA has additional 
responsibilities before loan approval is determined. The various 
responsibilities are as follows:

         Applicant's Responsibilities for a Complete Application

    (1) Completed Form FmHA 410-1, ``Application for FmHA Services,'' 
including a signed Form FmHA 410-9, ``Statement Required by the Privacy

    (2) If the applicant is a cooperative, corporation, partnership, or 
joint operation:

cooperative or corporation, by each, or the percentage of interest held 
in the partnership or joint operation, by each.
    (ii) A current personal financial statement from each of the members 
of a cooperative, stockholders of a corporation, partners of a 
partnership, or joint operators of a joint operation.

cooperative, corporation, partnership, or joint operation to apply for 
and obtain the desired loan and execute required debt, security, and 
other instruments and agreements.
    (3) A brief written description as to the farm training and/or 
experience of the applicant and the individual members of an entity

in Section 1924.74 of subpart B of part 1924 of this chapter is 
requested, provide verification of any courses taken which covered 
production and/or financial management concepts, and/or a statement 
explaining how the applicant's proven performance based on 5-year 
production records demonstrates production ability.
    (4) Supporting and documented verification that the applicant (and 
all members of an entity applicant) cannot obtain credit elsewhere, 
including a guaranteed loan.
    (5) Financial records for the past five years. Income tax records 
may be provided by the applicant when other financial records are not

applicant's expenses.
    (9) Projected production, income and expenses, and loan repayment 
plan, which may be submitted on Form FmHA 431-2, ``Farm and Home Plan,'' 
or other similar plans of operation acceptable to FSA.

1940 of this chapter including SCS Form CPA-026, ``Highly Erodible Land 
and Wetland Conservation Determination,'' Form AD-1026, ``Highly 
Erodible Land Conservation (HELC) and Wetland Conservation (WC) 
Certification,'' and Form FmHA 1940-20, as required by subpart G of part 
1940 of this chapter.
    (11) A legal description of farm, real estate property and/or (if 
applicable) a copy of any lease, contract, option or

Exclusions,'' or Class I and Class II assessment, whichever is 
applicable.
    (21) Real estate and chattel appraisal, when applicable.
    (22) Completion of the assessment in accordance with Sec. 1924.55.
    (c) Notifying applicants that direct loan eligibility is subject to 
the unavailability of guaranteed financing. If the assessment, completed 
in accordance with Sec. 1924.55 concludes that guaranteed assistance may 
be available, with or without interest assistance, a prospectus will be 
sent to area lenders in accordance with Sec. 1951.262(f) as appropriate. 
If a lender indicates interest in providing financing with a Farm Credit 
Programs loan guarantee, refer to Sec. 1980.113(c) for handling as a 
market placement application. No direct loan to a current borrower will 
be approved until the process outlined in this paragraph has been 
concluded.
    (d) Incomplete Farm Credit Programs applications. (1) When an 
incomplete application is received, a County Office official will stamp 
the filing date on the front of Form FmHA 410-1, and enter the date in 
the ``Application Received'' and ``Incomplete Application'' fields in 
the Application Processing Module of MRS.
    (2) When an application that was received incomplete is completed, 
the date will be entered in the ``Application Completed'' field in the 
Application Processing Module of MRS. The County Supervisor will follow 
the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) Applicants who do not submit necessary information for complete 
applications, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, for EM, FO, 
OL and SW loans, will be handled as follows:
    (i) No later than 10 calendar days after receipt of the application, 
the County Supervisor will send the applicant a letter similar to FmHA 
Guide Letter 1910-A-1. The letter will:
    (A) List the additional information needed.
    (B) State that the application cannot be processed until all 
required information is received in the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 County Office.
    (C) Set a specific due date for the information. This date will be 
20 calendar days after the date of the letter.
    (ii) When information is needed from other USDA Agencies, the County 
Supervisor will inform those Agencies and the applicant of the 
information needed, and note the date of the request in the running 
record. For operating loan applications, the County Supervisor will 
request that the Agencies return the information to the County Office 
within 15 calendar days of the date of receipt of the request.
    (iii) If the necessary information has not been received from the 
applicant 20 calendar days after the date of the first written 
notification of an incomplete

[[Page 79]]

application, the County Supervisor will immediately send the applicant a 
letter similar to FmHA Guide Letter 1910-A-2.
    (A) The letter will again list the additional information needed, 
and state that the application cannot be processed until all the 
required information is received.
    (B) The letter will set a due date of 10 calendar days from the date 
of the letter. It will further state that unless the applicant supplies 
the required information or contacts the County Office by that date, the 
application will be withdrawn without further notice.
    (C) This letter will contain the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) 
statement set forth in Sec. 1910.6(b)(1) of this subpart.
    (D) A copy of this letter must be sent to the District Office at the 
same time it is sent to the applicant.
    (iv) If the applicant has not contacted the County Office by the due 
date set in the second notification letter, the County Supervisor will 
then withdraw the application.
    (v) All applications withdrawn will be handled in accordance with 
Sec. 2033.7 of FmHA Instruction 2033-A.
    (e) Notifying applicants (including presently indebted borrowers) 
about Limited Resource loans. Immediately after an application for OL, 
FO, SW, or EM assistance is received, the County Supervisor will send a 
letter similar to Guide Letter 1924-B-1 to the applicant telling the 
applicant about Limited Resource loans.
    (f) Notifying socially disadvantaged applicants regarding the 
availability of Direct Farm Ownership (FO) loans. Immediately after an 
application for FO assistance is received, the County Supervisor will 
send exhibit B of this subpart, ``Letter to Notify Socially 
Disadvantaged Applicants/Borrowers Regarding the Availability of 
Acquired Farmland,'' to the applicants. Exhibit B will also be presented 
to all socially disadvantaged individuals at the time they make their 
initial contact regarding Agency credit services. Socially disadvantaged 
applicants are defined in Sec. 1943.4 of subpart A of part 1943 of this 
chapter.
    (g) Notifying Borrowers about Farm Credit Programs (FCP) Borrower 
Responsibilities. When an application for OL, FO, SW or EM assistance is 
approved, the County Supervisor will provide to the borrower exhibit C 
of this subpart, ``Letter to Notify Applicant(s)/Borrower(s) of Their 
Responsibilities in Connection with FmHA Farmer Programs Loans.''
    (h) Determining eligibility. The Agency will determine eligibility 
of all Farm Credit Programs applicants including those who are already 
indebted for a Farm Credit Programs loan. The Farm Credit Programs 
application does not need to be complete before it is reviewed; however, 
all information relative to the eligibility decision must be received. 
The Rural Housing Service will determine eligibility for all RH loan 
applicants.
    (1) The Agency will certify whether or not the applicant meets the 
eligibility requirements and whether or not the applicant is a beginning 
farmer or rancher, as defined in the applicable Farm Credit Programs 
loan making regulation. An eligible Operating Loan (OL) or Farm 
Ownership (FO) Loan applicant, who is considered a beginning farmer or 
rancher, will have access to targeted funds. An eligible FO applicant 
requesting to purchase suitable farmland, who is considered a beginning 
farmer or rancher, will be given priority in accordance with 
Sec. 1955.107 (f). In addition, it is the responsibility of the Agency 
to determine whether or not the FO applicant is an operator of not 
larger than a family size farm, as of the time immediately after the 
contract of sale or lease is entered into, even though the applicant is 
not in need of Agency credit assistance on eligible rates and terms to 
purchase suitable farmland. The loan approval official will determine 
the applicant's projected repayment ability, the adequacy of collateral 
equity to secure the requested loan, and the feasibility of the proposed 
operation.
    (2) An outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a 
Federal Court (other than the United States Tax Court), which has been 
recorded, shall cause the applicant to be ineligible for any loan or 
grant until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. Agency 
loan or grant

[[Page 80]]

funds may not be used to satisfy the judgment.
    (i) Timeliness. Processing requirements for each program area are as 
follows:
    (1) Farm Credit Programs (FCP) applications. Each application must 
be approved or disapproved and the applicant notified in writing of the 
action taken, not later than 60 days after receipt of a complete 
application. The District Director will monitor the processing of all 
applications to ensure that each is processed in a timely manner and 
receives a final disposition (i.e., approval, rejection, or withdrawal) 
within the timeframes outlined in this section.
    (i) Receipt by the applicant of a signed copy of Form FmHA 1940-1, 
``Request for Obligation of Funds,'' will be considered written notice 
of loan approval.
    (ii) If a complete application is not approved or disapproved 45 
calendar days after all necessary information is received, the following 
steps will be taken:
    (A) The County Supervisor will make sure that the data in the County 
Office MRS data base regarding the application are up-to-date, and that 
the reason it remains pending is noted. A selection of reasons is listed 
in MRS.
    (B) Every week the District Director will generate a report, using 
the FOCUS Ad-Hoc Reporting System, based on the weekly upload of 
information from each county office MRS data base. The District Director 
will note each complete application pending more than 45 calendar days, 
and immediately take steps to ensure that final disposition on the 
application is taken no later than 60 calendar days after receipt of the 
complete application.
    (C) The Administrator will utilize MRS data and any other 
information available to comply with any statutory reporting 
requirements concerning the status of applications.
    (2) Single Family Housing (SFH) loans. Written notice of eligibility 
or ineligibility will be sent to each applicant not later than 30 days 
after receipt of a complete application. If a determination of 
eligibility cannot be made within 30 days from the date of receipt of 
the complete application, the applicant will be notified in writing of 
the circumstances causing the delay and the approximate time needed to 
make a decision.
    (3) Labor Housing (LH) preapplications. Preapplications must be 
determined eligible and feasible and the applicant notified in writing 
in accordance with applicable program regulations not later than 45 days 
after receipt of a complete preapplication. This eligibility 
determination will be made regardless of funding levels.
    (4) LH applications. If a determination of eligibility cannot be 
made within 30 days from the date of receipt of a complete application, 
the applicant will be notified in writing of the circumstances causing 
the delay and the approximate time needed to make a decision.
    (5) Adverse decisions. If an applicant is given an adverse decision, 
the applicant will be given appeal rights as provided in subpart B of 
part 1900 or 7 CFR part 780, as appropriate. The letter will contain the 
ECOA statement set forth in Sec. 1910.6(b)(1) of this subpart.
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) Active applications. An applicant may voluntarily withdraw an 
application at any time. Except for incomplete Farm Credit Programs 
applications, when an applicant has been determined eligible, but 
further processing is delayed due to an apparent lack of interest, the 
applicant will be advised by letter that the application will be 
considered withdrawn unless the County Office receives a written request 
within 30 days that further consideration is desired. The letter to the 
borrower will contain the ECOA statement set forth in Sec. 1910.6(b)(1) 
of this subpart.
    (1) Applications for RH, RHS, and LH loans (posted on Form FmHA 
1905-4, ``Application and Processing Card--Individual,'' or inputted in 
the Application Processing Module of MRS) received during any fiscal 
year will remain active during the remainder of that fiscal year in 
which they were received, plus the subsequent fiscal year, unless 
withdrawn or disapproved, or unless the loan is closed.
    (2) Applications received for FO, SW, OL, EM, and persons applying 
for RH loans on farms or nonfarm tracts who

[[Page 81]]

derive a major portion of their income from farming (inputted in the 
Application Processing Module of MRS), will remain active for 12 months 
from the date a complete application is received, unless withdrawn or 
disapproved, or unless the loan is closed.
    (3) See paragraph (d) of this section for procedures for incomplete 
Farm Credit Programs applications.
    (4) All applications which are withdrawn or rejected will be handled 
in accordance with Sec. 2033.7 of the Agency Instruction 2033-A. If 
notice has been received by the Agency that an adverse action is under 
investigation or in litigation, that application and all related 
material will be retained until final disposition of the matter.
    (5) When an application has been approved and funds are not 
available, and the steps outlined in Sec. 1910.6(g) of this subpart have 
been taken, the following provisions apply:
    (i) The County Supervisor will, during the 11th month following loan 
approval, notify the applicant that the application will expire 12 
months from the date of loan approval.
    (ii) If the applicant wants the application to remain active, the 
applicant must provide the County Office with a written request within 
30 days, requesting that the application remain active.
    (iii) The applications retained at the applicant's request will be 
extended for only one additional 12-month period.
    (iv) If the applicant fails to respond to the County Supervisor's 
written request, the application will be withdrawn.

<R05>
Sec. 1910.5  Evaluating applications.

    The following criteria will be considered in addition to the 
eligibility criteria in applicable program regulations.
    (a) Age of applicant. When evaluating the application, the age of 
the applicant will not be used as a consideration of eligibility 
(provided the applicant has reached the legal age of majority in the 
State, or has had the minority removed by court action) except when a 
specific age is being used to the advantage of the applicant (e.g. 
assistance under the 504 grant program).
    (b) Credit history. Credit history will be a consideration to the 
extent that it is used in evaluating all applicants for similar types 
and amounts of credit. For instance, credit requirements for a female 
applicant will not differ from those for a male applicant.
    (c) When the applicant, including any members of an entity 
applicant, caused the Agency a loss by receiving debt forgiveness, they 
are ineligible for assistance in accordance with applicable program 
eligibility regulations. If the debt forgiveness is cured by repayment 
of the Agency's loss, the Agency may still consider the debt forgiveness 
in determining the applicant's creditworthiness. The following 
circumstances do not automatically indicate an unacceptable credit 
history:
    (1) Foreclosures, judgments, delinquent payments of the applicant 
which occurred more than 36 months before the application, if no recent 
similar situations have occurred, or Agency delinquencies that have been 
resolved through loan service programs as defined in Sec. 1951.906 of 
part 1951 of subpart S of this chapter.
    (2) Isolated incidents of delinquent payments which do not represent 
a general pattern of unsatisfactory or slow payment.
    (3) ``No history'' of credit transactions by the applicant.
    (4) Recent foreclosure, judgment or delinquent payment when the 
applicant can satisfactorily demonstrate that:
    (i) The circumstances causing any of the above were of a temporary 
nature and were beyond the applicant's control. Example: loss of job; 
delay or reduction in government benefits, or other loss of income; 
increased living expenses due to illness, death, etc.
    (ii) The adverse action or delinquency was the result of a refusal 
to make full payment because of defective goods or services or as a 
result of some other justifiable dispute relating to the

[[Page 82]]

goods or services purchased or contracted for.
    (5) Non-payment of a debt due to circumstances beyond the 
applicant's or borrower's control. However, non-payment of a debt due to 
circumstances within an applicant's or borrower's control may be used as 
an indication of unacceptable credit history, in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The mere fact that an applicant or 
borrower filed bankruptcy will not be used as an indication of 
unacceptable credit history. The circumstances causing the nonpayment of 
debt, i.e., whether nonpayment was beyond the applicant's or borrower's 
control, however, are proper considerations.
    (d) Current/Past FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 Loan History. Current or previous delinquent FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 loans, as determined by reviewing the 
Current/Past Debt Inquiry System or the Borrower Cross-Reference Inquiry 
System, will be used to help determine the credit history of an 
applicant.
    (e) Delinquency on a Federal debt. The Department of Housing and 
Urban Development Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System 
(CAIVRS) will be used to help determine if an applicant is deliquent on 
any Federal debt.

Sec. 1910.10  Preference.

    (a) Veterans. (1) Veteran's preference is given to any person 
applying for an RH, FO, SW, or OL loan who has been honorably

    (a) Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944. Section 512(a)(D) of the 
Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, provides that an 
applicant for a direct housing loan from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) must be ``unable to obtain a loan for such purposes from 
the Secretary of Agriculture under the Consolidated Farm and Rural 
Development Act, as amended, or the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.'' 
Department of Veterans Affairs Loan Guaranty Officers may, therefore, 
require VA loan applicants to apply to the agency for loan assistance.
    (b) Veterans determined ineligible by the Agency. If the veteran is 
unable to obtain a loan, the County Supervisor will, upon request, 
furnish the applicant with a rejection letter to be presented to the 
Loan Guaranty Officer. The Loan Guaranty Officer may consult with the 
County Supervisor regarding the investigation made by the Agency of the

    (B) Dormitory and other nonfamily type projects, where the length of 
occupancy will be:
    (1) More than 6 months, will be in substantial conformance with the 
applicable development standard and will at least meet or exceed the 
requirements of the Department of Labor, Bureau of Employment Security 
(29 CFR 1910.140).
    (2) Six months or less, will comply with 
Sec. 1924.5(d)(1)(vi)(A)(3).
    (vii) Farm service buildings should be designed and constructed for 
adaptation to the local area. In designing and locating farm service 
buildings, consideration will be given to practices recommended by 
agriculture colleges, the Extension Service (ES), Soil Conservation 
Service (SCS) and other reliable sources.
    (2) Drawings, specifications, and estimates will fully describe the 
work. Technical data, tests, or engineering evaluations may be required 
to support the design of the development. The ``Guide for Drawings and 
Specifications,'' exhibit C of this subpart, describes the drawings and 
specifications that are to be included in the application for building 
construction, and subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter describes the 
drawings that should be included for development of building sites. The 
specific development standard being used, if required under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section will be identified on all drawings and 
specifications.
    (3) Materials acceptance shall be the same as described in paragraph 
X of exhibit B to this subpart.
    (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (iii) of this 
section, new building construction and additions shall be designed and 
constructed in accordance with the earthquake (seismic) requirements of 
the applicable Agency's development standard (building code). The 
analysis and design of structural systems and components shall be in 
accordance with applicable requirements of an acceptable model building 
code.
    (i) Agricultural buildings that are not intended for human 
habitation are exempt from these earthquake (seismic) requirements.
    (ii) Single family conventional light wood frame dwellings of two 
stories or 35 feet in height maximum shall be designed and constructed 
in accordance with the 1992 Council of American Building Officials 
(CABO) One and Two Family Dwelling Code or the latest edition.
    (iii) Single family housing of masonry design and townhouses of wood 
frame construction and additions financed (either directly or through a 
guarantee) under title V of the Housing Act of 1949 are recommended to 
be designed and constructed in accordance with the earthquake (seismic) 
requirements of one of the building codes that provides an equivalent 
level of safety to that contained in the latest edition of the National 
Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program's (NEHRP) Recommended Provisions for 
the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Building (NEHRP 
Provisions).
    (iv) Acknowledgment of compliance with the applicable seismic safety 
requirements for new construction will be contained in the certification 
of final plans and specification on the appropriate Agency Form.
    (e) Land development. (1) In planning land development, 
consideration will be given to practices, including energy conservation 
measures, recommended

[[Page 90]]

by agricultural colleges, ES, SCS or other reliable sources. All land 
and water development will conform to applicable laws, ordinances, 
zoning and other applicable regulations including those related to soil 
and water conservation and pollution abatement. The County Supervisor or 
District Director also will encourage the applicant to use any cost-
sharing and planning assistance that may be available through 
agricultural conservation programs.
    (2) Site and subdivision planning and development must meet the 
requirements of subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter.
    (3) Plans and descriptive material will fully describe the work.
    (4) The site planning design, development, installation and set-up 
of manufactured home sites, rental projects and subdivisions shall meet 
the requirements of exhibit J of this subpart and subpart C of part 1924 
of this chapter.
    (i) Plans for land leveling, irrigation, or drainage should include 
a map of the area to be improved showing the existing conditions with 
respect to soil, topography, elevations, depth of topsoil, kind of 
subsoil, and natural drainage, together with the proposed land 
development.
    (ii) When land development consists of, or includes, the 
conservation and use of water for irrigation or domestic purposes, the 
information submitted to the County Supervisor will include a statement 
as to the source of the water supply, right to the use of the water, and 
the adequacy and quality of the supply.
    (f) Responsibilities for planning development. Planning construction 
and land development and obtaining technical services in connection with 
drawings, specifications and cost estimates are the sole responsibility 
of the applicant, with such assistance from the County Supervisor or 
District Director (whichever is the appropriate loan processing and 
servicing officer for the type of loan involved), as may be necessary to 
be sure that the development is properly planned in order to protect 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's security.
    (1) Responsibility of the applicant. (i) The applicant will arrange 
for obtaining any required technical services from qualified 
technicians, tradespeople, and recognized plan services, and the 
applicant will furnish the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 sufficient information to describe fully the planned development 
and the manner in which it will be accomplished.
    (ii) When items of construction or land development require drawings 
and specifications, they will be sufficiently complete to avoid any 
misunderstanding as to extent, kind, and quality of work to be 
performed. The applicant will provide FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 with one copy of the drawings and specifications. 
Approval will be indicated by the applicant and acceptance for the 
purposes of the loan indicated by the County Supervisor or District 
Director on all sheets of the drawings and at the end of the 
specifications, and both instruments will be a part of the loan docket. 
After the loan is closed, the borrower will retain a conformed copy of 
the approved drawings and specifications, and provide another conformed 
copy to the contractor. Items not requiring drawings and specifications 
may be described in narrative form.
    (iii) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will 
accept final drawings and specifications and any modifications thereof 
only after the documents have been certified in writing as being in 
conformance with the applicable development standard if required under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Certification is required for all 
Single Family Housing (SFH) thermal designs (plans, specifications, and 
calculations).
    (A) Certifications may be accepted from individuals or organizations 
who are trained and experienced in the compliance, interpretation or 
enforcement of the applicable development standards for drawings and 
specifications. Plan certifiers may be any of the following:
    (1) Licensed architects,
    (2) Professional engineers,

[[Page 91]]

    (3) Plan reviewers certified by a national model code organization 
listed in exhibit E to this subpart,
    (4) Local building officials authorized to review and approve 
building plans and specifications, or
    (5) National codes organizations listed in exhibit E to this 
subpart.
    (B) The license or authorization of the individual must be current 
at the time of the certification statement. A building permit (except as 
noted in paragraph (f)(1)(iii)(C)(2) of this section) or professional's 
stamp is not an acceptable substitute for the certification statement. 
However, a code compliance review conducted by one of the National 
recognized code organizations indicating no deficiencies or the noted 
deficiencies have been corrected is an acceptable substitute for the 
certification statement.
    (C) For Single Family Housing (one to four family dwelling units) 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may also accept 
drawings and specifications that have been certified by:
    (1) Registered Professional Building Designers certified by the 
American Institute of Building Design.
    (2) A local community, if that community has adopted, by reference, 
one of the model building codes and has trained official(s) who 
review(s) plans as well as inspect(s) construction for compliance as a 
requisite for issuing a building permit. The building permit, issued by 
the community, may serve as evidence of acceptance. The State Director 
will determine eligible communities and publish, as a State supplement 
to this section, a list of those communities that qualify.
    (3) A plan service that provides drawings and specifications that 
are certified by individuals or organizations as listed in paragraph 
(f)(1)(iii)(A) or (f)(1)(iii)(C) (1) and (2) of this section as meeting 
the appropriate state adopted development standard.
    (4) Builders/Contractors who provide 10-year warranty plans for the 
specific FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 finance 
dwelling unit that meet the requirements of exhibit L of this subpart.
    (5) Builders/Contractors that are approved by the United States 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for self-
certification.
    (D) The modifications of certified drawings or specifications must 
be certified by the same individual or organization that certified the 
original drawings and specifications. If such individual or organization 
is not available, the entire set of modified drawings and specifications 
must be recertified.
    (E) The certification of modifications for single family housing 
(SFH) construction may be waived if the builder or original author of 
the drawings and specifications provides a written statement that the 
modifications are not regulated by the applicable development standard. 
The County Supervisor may consult with the State Office Architect/
Engineer as to acceptance of the statement and granting a waiver.
    (F) All certifications of final drawings, specifications, and 
calculations shall be on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1924-25, ``Plan Certification.''
    (2) Responsibility of the County Supervisor or District Director. In 
accordance with program regulations for loans and grants they are 
required to process, the County Supervisor or District Director, for the 
sole benefit of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, 
will:
    (i) Visit each farm or site on which the development is proposed. 
For an FO loan, the County Supervisor and the applicant will determine 
the items of development necessary to put the farm in a livable and 
operable condition at the outset. Prepare Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-1, when applicable in accordance 
with the Forms Manual Insert (FMI) for the form, after a complete 
understanding has been reached between the applicant and the County 
Supervisor regarding the development to be accomplished, including the 
dates each item of development will be started and completed.
    (ii) Notify the loan or grant applicant in writing immediately if, 
after reviewing the preliminary proposal and inspecting the site, the 
proposal is not acceptable. If the proposal is acceptable, an 
understanding will be reached with the applicant concerning the

[[Page 92]]

starting date for each item of development.
    (iii) Discuss with the applicant the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 requirements with respect to good construction 
and land development practices.
    (iv) Advise the applicant regarding drawings, specifications, cost 
estimates, and other related material which the applicant must submit to 
the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for review 
before the loan can be developed. Advise the applicant of the 
information necessary in the drawings, how the cost estimates should be 
prepared, the number of sets of drawings, specifications, and cost 
estimates required, and the necessity for furnishing such information 
promptly. Advise the applicant that FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 will provide appropriate specification forms, Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-2, 
``Description of Materials,'' and Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1924-3, ``Service Building Specifications.'' 
The applicant may, however, use other properly prepared specifications.
    (v) Advise the applicant regarding publications, plans, planning 
aids, engineering data, and other technical advice and assistance 
available through local, state, and Federal agencies, and private 
individuals and organizations.
    (vi) Review the information furnished by the applicant to determine 
the completeness of the plans, adequacy of the cost estimates, 
suitability and soundness of the proposed development.
    (vii) When appropriate, offer suggestions as to how drawings and 
specifications might be altered to improve the facility and better serve 
the needs of the applicant. The County Supervisor or District Director 
may assist the applicant in making revisions to the drawings. When 
appropriate, the contract documents will be forwarded to the State 
architect/engineer for review. For revisions requiring technical 
determinations that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 is not able to make, the applicant will be requested to obtain 
additional technical assistance.
    (viii) Provide the applicant with a written list of changes required 
in the contract documents. The applicant will submit two complete 
revised (as requested) sets of contract documents, for approval. On one 
set, the County Supervisor or District Director will indicate acceptance 
on each sheet of the drawings, and on the cover of the specifications 
and all other contract documents. At least the date and the initials of 
the approval official must be shown. On projects where a consulting 
architect or engineer has been retained, this acceptance will be 
indicated only after the State Director has given written authorization. 
The marked set of documents shall be available at the job site at all 
times for review by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354. The second set will become part of the loan docket.
    (ix) Review the proposed method of doing the work and determine 
whether the work can be performed satisfactorily under the proposed 
method.
    (x) Instruct the applicant not to incur any debts prior to loan 
closing for materials or labor or make any expenditures for such 
purposes with the expectation of being reimbursed from loan funds.
    (xi) Instruct the applicant not to commence any construction nor 
cause any supplies or materials to be delivered to the construction site 
prior to loan closing.
    (xii) Under certain conditions prescribed in exhibit H of this 
subpart, provide the applicant with a copy of the leaflet, ``Warning--
Lead-Based Paint Hazards,'' which is attachment 1 of exhibit H 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office), and the warning sheet, ``Caution Note on Lead-Based Paint 
Hazard,'' which is attachment 2 of exhibit H (available in any FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (g) Surplus structures and use or sale of timber, sand, or stone. In 
planning the development, the applicant and the County Supervisor or 
District Director should, when practicable, plan to use salvage from old 
buildings, timber, sand, gravel, or stone from the property. The 
borrower may sell surplus

[[Page 93]]

buildings, timber, sand, gravel, or stone that is not to be used in 
performing planned development and use net proceeds to pay costs of 
performing planned development work. In such a case:
    (1) An agreement will be recorded in the narrative of Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-1 which as a minimum 
will:
    (i) Identify the property to be sold, the estimated net proceeds to 
be received, and the approximate date by which the property will be 
sold.
    (ii) Provide that the borrower will deposit the net proceeds in the 
supervised bank account and apply any funds remaining after the 
development is complete as an extra payment on the loan, or in 
accordance with Sec. 1965.13(f) of subpart A of part 1965 of this 
chapter for farm program loans.
    (2) The agreement will be considered by the Government as modifying 
the mortgage contract to the extent of authorizing and requiring the 
Government to release the identified property subject to the conditions 
stated in the agreement without payment or other consideration at the 
time of release, regardless of whether or not the mortgage specifically 
refers to Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-1 or the agreement to release.
    (3) If the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
loan will be secured by a junior lien, all prior lienholders must give 
written consent to the proposed sale and the use of the net proceeds 
before the loan is approved.
    (4) Releases requested by the borrower or the buyer will be 
processed in accordance with applicable release procedures in subpart A 
or subpart C of part 1965 of this chapter, as appropriate.
    (h) Review prior to performing development work. For the sole 
benefit of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, prior 
to beginning development work, the County Supervisor or District 
Director will review planned development with the borrower. Adequacy of 
the drawings and specifications as well as the estimates will be checked 
to make sure the work can be completed within the time limits previously 
agreed upon and with available funds. Items and quantities of any 
materials the borrower has agreed to furnish will be checked and dates 
by which each item of development should be started will be checked in 
order that the work may be completed on schedule. If any changes in the 
plans and specifications are proposed, they should be within the general 
scope of the work as originally planned. Changes must be approved and 
processed in accordance with Sec. 1924.10 of this subpart. The 
appropriate procedure for performing development should be explained to 
the borrower. Copies of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 forms that will be used during the period of construction should 
be given to the borrower. The borrower should be advised as to the 
purpose of each form and at what period during construction each form 
will be used.
    (i) Time of starting development work. Development work will be 
started as soon as feasible after the loan is closed. Except in cases in 
which advance commitments are made in accordance with subpart A of part 
1944 of this chapter or according to Sec. 1924.13(e)(1)(vi)(A) or 
Sec. 1924.13(e)(2)(ix)(A) of this subpart, no commitments with respect 
to performing planned development will be made by the County Supervisor, 
District Director, or the applicant before the loan is closed. The 
applicant will be instructed that before the loan is closed, debts 
should not be incurred for labor or materials, or expenditures made for 
such purposes, with the expectation of being reimbursed from loan funds 
except as provided in subpart A of part 1943 of this chapter and 
subparts A and E of part 1944 of this chapter. However, with the prior 
approval of the National Office, a State Supplement may be issued 
authorizing County Supervisors to permit applicants to commence 
welldrilling operations prior to loan closing, provided:
    (1) It is necessary in the area to provide the water supply prior to 
loan closing,
    (2) The applicant agrees in writing to pay with personal funds all 
costs incurred if a satisfactory water supply is not obtained,

[[Page 94]]

    (3) Any contractors and suppliers understand and agree that loan 
funds may not be available to make the payment,
    (4) Such action will not result under applicable State law in the 
giving of priority to mechanics and materialmen's liens over the later 
recorded FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 mortgage, 
and
    (5) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 does not 
guarantee that the cost will be paid.

<R05>
Sec. 1924.6  Performing development work.

    All construction work will be performed by one, or a combination, of 
the following methods: Contract, borrower, mutual self-help, or owner-
builder. All development work must be performed by a person, firm or 
organization qualified to provide the service. Conditional commitment 
construction is covered under subpart A of part 1944 of this chapter.
    (a) Contract method. This method of development will be used for all 
major construction except in cases where it is clearly not possible to 
obtain a contract at a reasonable or competitive cost. Work under this 
method is performed in accordance with a written contract.
    (1) Forms used. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1924-6, ``Construction Contract,'' will be used for SFH 
construction. Other contract documents for more complex construction, 
acceptable to the loan approval official and containing the requirements 
of subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter, may be used provided they are 
customarily used in the area and protect the interest of the borrower 
and the Government with respect to compliance with items such as the 
drawings, specifications, payments for work, inspections, completion, 
nondiscrimination in construction work and acceptance of the work. If 
needed, the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) will be consulted. The 
United States (including FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354) will not become a party to a construction contract or incur any 
liability under it.
    (2) Contract provisions. Contracts will have a listing of 
attachments and the provisions of the contract will include:
    (i) The contract sum.
    (ii) The dates for starting and completing the work.
    (iii) The amount of liquidated damages to be charged.
    (iv) The amount, method, and frequency of payment.
    (v) Whether or not surety bonds will be provided.
    (vi) The requirement that changes or additions must have prior 
written approval of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354.
    (3) Surety requirements. (i) Unless an exception is granted in 
accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section or when interim 
financing will be used, surety that guarantees both payment and 
performance in the amount of the contract will be furnished when one or 
more of the following conditions exist:
    (A) The contract exceeds $100,000.
    (B) The loan approval official determines that a surety bond appears 
advisable to protect the borrower against default of the contractor.
    (C) The applicant requests a surety bond.
    (D) The contract provides for partial payments in excess of the 
amount of 60 percent of the value of the work in place.
    (E) The contract provides for partial payments for materials 
suitably stored on the site.
    (ii) If surety bonds are required the construction contract must 
indicate that the contractor will furnish properly executed surety bonds 
prior to the start of any work. Exhibits F and G of this subpart as 
revised by OGC if necessary to comply with local or state statutory 
requirements will be used as the forms of payment bond and performance 
bond to be provided. Unless noncorporate surety is provided, the surety 
bonds may only be obtained from a corporate bonding company listed on 
the current Department of the Treasury Circular 570 (published annually 
in the Federal Register), as

[[Page 95]]

holding a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal 
bonds and as legally doing business in the State where the land is 
located. Noncorporate sureties are not recommended and the State 
Director will be responsible for determining the acceptability of the 
individual or individuals proposed as sureties on the bonds. The State 
Director must determine that an individual or individuals proposed as 
sureties must have cash or other liquid assets easily convertible to 
cash in an amount at least equal to 25 percent more than the contract 
amount in order to be acceptable. The individual(s) will pledge such 
liquid assets in an amount equal to the contract amount. Fees charged 
for noncorporate sureties may not exceed fees charged by corporate 
sureties on bonds of equal amount and, in no case, may surety be 
provided by the applicant or any person or organization with an identity 
of interest in the applicant's operation. The United States (including 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354) will incur no 
liability related in any way to a performance or payment bond provided 
in connection with a construction contract. FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 will be named as co-obligee in the performance 
and payment bonds unless prohibited by state law.
    (iii) When an experienced and reliable contractor cannot obtain 
payment and performance bonds meeting the surety requirements of 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the State Director may entertain a 
request from the applicant for an exception to the surety requirements. 
The applicant's request must specifically state why the proposed 
contractor is unable to obtain payment and performance bonds meeting the 
surety requirements, and why it is financially advantageous for the 
applicant to award the contract to the proposed contractor without the 
required bonds.

If the applicant's request is reasonable and justified, and if the 
proposed contractor is reliable and experienced in the construction of 
projects of similar size, design, scope, and complexity, the State 
Director may grant an exception to the surety requirements for loans or 
grants within the State Director's approval authority and accept one or 
a combination of the following:
    (A) An unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit issued by a 
lending institution which has been reviewed and approved by OGC. In such 
cases, the construction contract must indicate that the contractor will 
furnish a properly executed letter of credit from a lending institution 
acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
prior to the start of any work. The letter of credit must remain in 
effect until the date of final acceptance of work by the owner and FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. In addition, the 
letter of credit must stipulate that the lending institution, upon 
written notification by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 of the contractor's failure to perform under the terms of the 
contract, will advance funds up to the amount of the contract (including 
all FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approved 
contract change orders) to satisfy all prior debts incurred by the 
contractor in performing the contract and all funds necessary to 
complete the work. Payments may be made to the contractor in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(12)(i)(C) of this section as if full surety bonds 
were being provided.
    (B) If a letter of credit satisfying the conditions of paragraph 
(a)(3)(iii)(A) of this section cannot be obtained, the State Director 
may accept a deposit in the amount of the contract, into an interest or 
non-interest bearing supervised bank account. In such cases, the 
construction contract must indicate that the contractor will furnish the 
required deposit prior to the start of any work and that the funds shall 
remain on deposit until final acceptance of work by the owner and FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Payments may be made 
to the contractor in accordance with paragraph (a)(12)(i)(C) of this 
section as if full surety bonds were being provided.
    (C) When the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iii) (A) or (B) of this 
section can be met except that a surety bond, a letter of credit, and/or 
deposits are not obtainable in full amount of the contract, the State 
Director may accept an amount less than the full amount of

[[Page 96]]

the contract provided all of the following conditions are met:
    (1) The contractor provides a surety bond, a letter of credit, or 
deposits in the greatest amount possible, and provides documentation 
indicating the reasons why amounts exceeding the proposed amount cannot 
be provided.
    (2) The applicant agrees to the amount of the surety bond, letter of 
credit, or deposits proposed, and the State Director determines that the 
applicant has the financial capability to withstand any financial loss 
due to default of the contractor.
    (3) In the opinion of the State Director, the proposed amount and 
the method of payment will provide adequate protection for the borrower 
and the Government against default of the contractor.
    (4) The contract provides for partial payments not to exceed 90 
percent of the value of the work in place for that portion of the total 
contract which is guaranteed by an acceptable surety bond, letter of 
credit, or deposits, and partial payments not to exceed 60 percent of 
the value of the work in place for that portion of the total contract 
which is not guaranteed by surety, letter of credit, or deposits.

    Example:

    Contractor has a surety bond which guarantees payment and 
performance in an amount of $150,000 which represents 75 percent of the 
total contract amount of $200,000. The contractor's first request for 
payment appears thus:

--Value of work in place is $10,000.
--Payment for work guaranteed by surety is 75 percent times $10,000 
times 90 percent is $6,750.
--Payment for work not guaranteed by surety is 25 percent times $10,000 
times 60 percent is $1,500.
--Authorized payment is $8,250.

    (Each partial payment shall reflect values for work guaranteed by 
surety, letter of credit, or deposits, and work not so guaranteed).

    (iv) In cases where the contractor does not obtain payment and 
performance bonds in accordance with the surety requirements of 
paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, or where an exception to the 
surety requirements is granted by the State Director, the following 
steps will be taken to protect the borrower and the government against 
latent obligations or defects in connection with the construction:
    (A) The contractor will furnish a properly executed corporate latent 
defects bond or a maintenance bond in the amount of 10 percent of the 
construction contract; or
    (B) An unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit in the amount 
of 10 percent of the construction contract issued by a lending 
institution which has been reviewed and approved by OGC; or
    (C) A cash deposit into an interest or non-interest bearing 
supervised bank account in the amount of 10 percent of the construction 
contract;
    (D) The period of protection against latent obligations and/or 
defects shall be one year from the date of final acceptance of work by 
the owner and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354;
    (E) Final payment shall not be rendered to the contractor until the 
provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(iv) (A), (B) or (C) of this section have 
been met;
    (F) The contract will contain a clause indicating that the 
contractor agrees to provide surety or guarantee acceptable to the owner 
and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 against latent 
obligations and/or defects in connection with the construction.
    (4) Equal opportunity. Section 1901.205 of subpart E of part 1901 of 
this chapter applies to all loans or grants involving construction 
contracts and subcontracts in excess of $10,000.
    (5) Labor standards provisions. The provisions of the Davis-Bacon 
and related acts, which are published by the Department of Labor (29 CFR 
parts 1, 3 and 5), will apply when the contract involves either LH grant 
assistance, or 9 or more units in a project being assisted under the HUD 
section 8 housing assistance payment program for new construction.
    (6) Historical and archaeological preservation. The provisions of 
subpart F of part 1901 of this chapter concerning the protection of 
historical and archaeological properties will apply to all construction 
financed, in whole or in part, by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 loans and grants. These provisions have special

[[Page 97]]

applicability to development in areas designated by NRCS as Resource 
Conservation and Development (RC&D) areas. (See part 1942, subpart I of 
this chapter.)
    (7) Air and water acts. Under Executive Order 11738, all loans or 
grants involving construction contracts for more than $100,000 must meet 
all the requirements of section 114 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
7414) and section 308 of the Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C., 
section 1813). The contract should contain provisions obligating the 
contractor as a condition for the award of the contract as follows:
    (i) To notify the owner of the receipt of any communication from 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicating that a facility to be 
utilized in the performance of the contract is under consideration to be 
listed on the EPA list of Violating Facilities. Prompt notification is 
required prior to contract award.
    (ii) To certify that any facility to be utilized in the performance 
of any nonexempt contractor subcontract is not listed on the EPA list of 
Violating Facilities as of the date of contract award.
    (iii) To include or cause to be included the above criteria and 
requirements of paragraphs (a)(7) (i) and (ii) of this section in every 
nonexempt subcontract, and that the contractor will take such action as 
the Government may direct as a means of enforcing such provisions.
    (8) Architectural barriers. In accordance with the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-480), as implemented by the General 
Services Administration regulations (41 CFR 101- 19.6) and section 504 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93-112) as implemented by 7 
CFR, parts 15 and 15b, all facilities financed with FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loans and grants and which are 
accessible to the public or in which people with disabilities may be 
employed or reside must be developed in compliance with this Act. Copies 
of the Act and Federal accessibility design standards may be obtained 
from the Executive Director, Architectural and Transportation Barriers 
Compliance Board, Washington, DC 20201.
    (9) National Environmental Policy Act. The provisions of subpart G 
of part 1940 of this chapter concerning environmental requirements will 
apply to all loans and grants including those being assisted under the 
HUD section 8 housing assistance payment program for new construction.
    (10) Obtaining bids and selecting a contractor. (i) The applicant 
may select a contractor and negotiate a contract or contact several 
contractors and request each to submit a bid. For complex construction 
projects, refer also to Sec. 1924.13(e) of this subpart.
    (ii) When a price has already been negotiated by an applicant and a 
contractor, the County Supervisor, District Director or other 
appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
official will review the proposed contract. If the contractor is 
qualified to perform the development and provide a warranty of the work 
and the price compares favorably with the cost of similar construction 
in the area, further negotiation is unnecessary. If the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official determines the price 
is too high or otherwise unreasonable, the applicant will be requested 
to negotiate further with the contractor. If a reasonable price cannot 
be negotiated or if the contractor is not qualified, the applicant will 
be requested to obtain competitive bids.
    (iii) When an applicant has a proposed development plan and no 
contractor in mind, competitive bidding will be encouraged. The 
applicant should obtain bids from as many qualified contractors, dealers 
or tradespeople as feasible depending on the method and type of 
construction.
    (iv) If the award of the contract is by competitive bidding, Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-5, 
``Invitation for Bid (Construction Contract),'' or another similar 
invitation bid form containing the requirements of subpart E of part 
1901 of this chapter, may be used. All contractors from whom bids are 
requested should be informed of all conditions of the contract including 
the time and place of opening bids. Conditions shall

[[Page 98]]

not be established which would give preference to a specific bidder or 
type of bidder. When applicable, copies of Forms FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-6 and FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 400-6, ``Compliance Statement,'' also should be 
provided to the prospective bidders.
    (11) Awarding the contract. The borrower, with the assistance of the 
County Supervisor or District Director, will consider the amount of the 
bids or proposals, and all conditions which were listed in the 
``Invitation for Bid.'' On the basis of these considerations, the 
borrower will select and notify the lowest responsible bidder.
    (i) Before work commences, the County Supervisor, District Director 
or other FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employee 
having knowledge of contracts and construction practices will hold a 
preconstruction conference with the borrower(s), contractor and 
architect/engineer (if applicable). The purpose of the conference is to 
reach a mutual understanding of each party's responsibilities under the 
terms and conditions of the contract documents and the loan agreement 
during the construction and warranty periods. Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-16, ``Record of Preconstruction 
Conference,'' may be used as a guide for an agenda.
    (ii) A summary of the items covered will be entered in the running 
case record.
    (iii) The contract will then be prepared, signed and copies 
distributed in accordance with the FMI for Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-6.
    (iv) After a borrower/contractor's contract or subcontract in excess 
of $10,000 is received in the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 County or District Office, the responsible FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official will send within 10 
calendar days of the date of the contract or subcontract, a report 
similar in form and content to exhibit C of subpart E of part 1901 of 
this chapter to the Area Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance 
Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, at the applicable address listed in 
exhibit E, subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter. The report must 
contain, at least, the following information: contractor's name, address 
and telephone number; employer's identification number; amount, starting 
date and planned completion date of the contract; contract number; and 
city and DOL region of the contract site. The information for this 
report should be obtained from the contractor when the contract is 
awarded.
    (12) Payments for work done by the contract method. (i) Payments 
will be made in accordance with one of the following methods unless 
prohibited by state statute, in which case the State Director shall 
issue a State Supplement to this section:
    (A) The ``One-Lump-Sum'' payment method will be used when the 
payment will be made in one lump-sum for the whole contract.
    (B) The ``Partial payments not to exceed 60 percent of the value of 
the work in place'' payment method will be used when the contractor does 
not provide surety bond, a letter of credit, or deposits.
    (C) The ``Partial payments in the amount of 90 percent of the value 
of the work in place and of the value of the materials suitably stored 
at the site'' payment method will be used when the contractor provides a 
surety bond equal to the total contract amount.
    (D) The ``Partial payments which reflect the portions of the 
contract amount which is guaranteed'' method will be used when the 
contractor provides surety bonds, a letter of credit, or deposits less 
than the total amount of the contract in accordance with the provisions 
of paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.
    (ii) When Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-6 is used, the appropriate payment clause will be checked and the 
other payment clauses not used will be effectively crossed out.
    (iii) When a contract form other than Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-6 is used, the payment clause must 
conform with paragraph (a)(12)(i) of this section and the appropriate 
clause as set forth in

[[Page 99]]

Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-6.
    (iv) The borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 must take precautionary measures to see that all payments made 
to the contractor are properly applied against bills for materials and 
labor procured under the contract. Prior to making any partial payment 
on any contract where a surety bond is not used, the contractor will be 
required to furnish the borrower and the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 with a statement showing the total amount owed 
to date for materials and labor procured under the contract. The 
contractor also may be required to submit evidence showing that previous 
partial payments were applied properly. When the borrower and the County 
Supervisor or District Director have reason to believe that partial 
payments may not be applied properly, checks may be made jointly to the 
contractor and persons who furnished materials and labor in connection 
with the contract.
    (v) When partial payments are requested by the contractor and 
approved by the owner, the amount of the partial payment will be 
determined by one of the following methods:
    (A) Based upon the percentage completed as shown on a recently 
completed and properly executed Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-12, ``Inspection Report.''
    (B) When the structure will be covered by an insured 10-year 
warranty, the insurer's construction inspector must provide FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with any available copies of 
inspection reports showing percentage of completion immediately after 
the inspections are completed. To make partial payments when copies of 
inspection reports are not available, the responsible FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official will make the 
inspections or will be guided by the provisions of 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(12)(v)(C) of this subpart. If further assurance is deemed 
necessary to justify partial payments, the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 official may make onsite inspections or require 
additional information.
    (C) Based upon an application for payment containing an estimate of 
the value of work in place which has been prepared by the contractor and 
accepted by the borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354. When the contract provides for partial payments for 
materials satisfactorily stored at the site, the application for payment 
may include these items. Prior to receiving the first partial payment, 
the contractor should be required to submit a list of major 
subcontractors and suppliers and a schedule of prices or values of the 
various phases of the work aggregating the total sum of the contract 
such as excavation, foundations, framing, roofing, siding, mill work, 
painting, plumbing, heating, electric wiring, etc., made out in such 
form as agreed upon by the borrower, FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354, and the contractor. In applying for payments, the 
contractor should submit a statement based upon this schedule. See 
exhibit A of this subpart for guidance in reviewing the contractor's 
schedule of prices and estimating the value of the work in place.
    (vi) Final payment. (A) When the structure will be covered by an 
insured 10-year warranty, the insurer must provide an insured 10-year 
warranty policy (or a binder if the policy is not available) before 
final payment is made to the builder.
    (B) Final payment of the amount due on the contract or disbursal of 
the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan funds 
where an interim loan was used will be made only upon completion of the 
entire contract, final inspection by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354, acceptance of the work by FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 and the borrower, issuance of any and 
all final permits and approvals for the use and occupancy of the 
structure by any applicable state and local governmental authorities, 
and compliance by the contractor with all terms and conditions of the 
contract. In the event the work of construction is delayed or 
interrupted by reason of fire, flood unusually stormy weather,

[[Page 100]]

war, riot, strike, an order, requisition or regulation of any 
governmental body (excluding delays related to possible defects in the 
contractor's performance and excluding delays caused by the necessity of 
securing building permits or any required inspection procedures 
connected therewith) or other contingencies reasonably unforeseeable and 
beyond the reasonable control of the contractor, then with the written 
consent of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the 
date of completion of the work may be extended by the owner by the 
period of such delay, provided that the contractor shall give the owner 
and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 written notice 
within 72 hours of the occurrence of the event causing the delay or 
interruption.
    (C) Prior to making final payment on the contract when a surety bond 
is not used or disbursing the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 loan funds when an interim loan was used, FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be provided with a Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-9, 
``Certificate of Contractor's Release,'' and Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-10, ``Release by Claimants.'' 
executed by all persons who furnished materials or labor in connection 
with the contract. The borrower should furnish the contractor with a 
copy of the ``Release by Claimants'' form at the beginning of the work 
in order that the contractor may obtain these releases as the work 
progresses.
    (1) If such releases cannot be obtained, the funds may be disbursed 
provided all the following can be met:
    (i) Release statements to the extent possible are obtained;
    (ii) The interests of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 can be adequately protected and its security position is not 
impaired; and
    (iii) Adequate provisions are made for handling the unpaid account 
by withholding or escrowing sufficient funds to pay any such claims or 
obtaining a release bond.
    (2) The State Director may issue a State Supplement which will:
    (i) Not require the use of Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-10, if, under existing state statutes, the 
furnishing of labor and materials gives no right to a lien against the 
property, or
    (ii) Provide an alternative method to protect against mechanic's and 
materialmen's liens. In this case, the use of Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-10 is optional.
    (b) Borrower method. The borrower method means performance of work 
by or under the direction of the borrower, using one or more of the ways 
specified in this paragraph. Development work may be performed by the 
borrower method only when it is not practicable to do the work by the 
contract method; the borrower possesses or arranges through an approved 
self-help plan for the necessary skill and managerial ability to 
complete the work satisfactorily; such work not interfere seriously with 
the borrower's farming operation or work schedule, and the County Office 
caseload will permit a County Supervisor to properly advise the borrower 
and inspect the work.
    (1) Ways of performing the work. The borrower will:
    (i) Purchase the material and equipment and do the work.
    (ii) Utilize lump-sum agreements for (A) minor items or minor 
portions of items of development, the total cost of which does not 
exceed $5,000 per agreement, such as labor, material, or labor and 
material for small service buildings, repair jobs, or land development; 
or (B) material and equipment which involve a single trade and will be 
installed by the seller, such as the purchase and installation of 
heating facilities, electric wiring, wells, painting, liming, or 
sodding. All agreements will be in writing, however, the County 
Supervisor may make an exception to this requirement when the agreement 
involves a relatively small amount.
    (2) Acceptance and storage of material on site. The County 
Supervisor will advise the borrower that the acceptance of material as 
delivered to the site and the proper storage of material will be the 
borrower's responsibility.
    (3) Payment for work done by the borrower method--(i) Payments for 
labor.

[[Page 101]]

Before the County Supervisor countersigns checks for labor, the borrower 
must submit a completed Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1924-11, ``Statement of Labor Performed,'' for each hired 
worker performing labor during the pay period. Ordinarily, checks for 
labor will be made payable to the workers involved. However, under 
justifiable circumstances, when the borrower has paid for labor with 
personal funds and has obtained signatures of the workers on Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-11 as having 
received payment, the County Supervisor may countersign a check made 
payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenditures. Under 
no circumstances will the County Supervisor permit loan funds or funds 
withdrawn from the supervised bank account to be used to pay the 
borrower for the borrower's own labor or labor performed by any member 
of the borrower's household.
    (ii) Payment for equipment, materials or lump-sum agreements. (A) 
Before countersigning checks for equipment or materials, the County 
Supervisor must normally have an invoice from the seller covering the 
equipment or materials to be purchased. When an invoice is not available 
at the time the check is issued, an itemized statement of the equipment 
or materials to be purchased may be substituted until a paid invoice 
from the seller is submitted, at which time the prepurchase statement 
may be destroyed.
    (B) When an invoice is available at the time the check is drawn, the 
check will include a reference to the invoice number, the invoice date 
if unnumbered and, if necessary, the purpose of the expenditure.
    (C) The check number and date of payment will be indicated on the 
appropriate Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-11, invoice, itemized statement of equipment or materials and/or 
lump-sum agreement.
    (D) Ordinarily, checks for equipment or materials will be made 
payable to the seller. Under justifiable circumstances, when the 
borrower has paid for equipment or materials with personal funds and 
furnished a paid invoice, the County Supervisor may countersign a check 
made payable to the borrower for reimbursement of these expenses.
    (E) When an invoice includes equipment or materials for more than 
one item of development, the appropriate part of the cost to be charged 
against each item of development will be indicated on the invoice by the 
borrower, with the assistance of the County Supervisor.
    (F) Payment made under lump-sum agreements will be made only when 
all items of equipment and materials have been furnished, labor has been 
performed as agreed upon, and the work has been accepted by the borrower 
and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (G) Each paid Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1924-11, invoice, itemized statement for equipment or material 
and/or lump-sum agreement will be given to the borrower in accordance 
with the FMI.
    (c) Mutual self-help method. The mutual self-help method is 
performance of work by a group of families by mutual labor under the 
direction of a construction supervisor, as described in subpart A of 
part 1944 of this chapter. The ways of doing the work, buying materials, 
and contracting for special services are like those used for the 
borrower method. Materials can be bought jointly by the group of 
families, but payments will be made individually by each family. In the 
case of RH loans to families being assisted by Self-Help Technical 
Assistance (TA) grants in accordance with subpart I of part 1944 of this 
chapter, the County Supervisor may countersign checks for materials and 
necessary contract work made payable directly to the TA grantee, 
provided the District Director determines that:
    (1) The grantee acts in the same capacity as a construction manager 
in the group purchase of material and services.
    (2) The grantee has an adequate bookkeeping system approved by the 
District Director to assure that funds in each RH account are properly 
distributed and maintained.
    (3) The grantee receives no compensation in the way of profit or 
overhead for this service and all discounts

[[Page 102]]

and rebates received in connection with the purchase of materials or 
services are passed on to the participating families.
    (4) The grantee has a record-keeping system which shows that the 
costs of the materials and services were prorated to each borrower's 
account in relation to the actual material and service used by each 
borrower.
    (d) Owner-builder method. This method of construction applies only 
to RRH loans made under subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. 
Regulations governing this method are found at Sec. 1924.13(e)(2) of 
this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 1924.8  Development work for modular/panelized housing units.

    (a) Exhibit B of this subpart applies to all loans involving 
modular/panelized housing units.
    (b) Complete drawings and specifications will be required as 
prescribed in exhibit C of this subpart. Each set of drawings will 
contain the design of the foundation system required for the soil and 
slope conditions of the particular site on which the modular/panelized 
house is to be placed.
    (c) The manufacturer will provide a certification (exhibit B, 
attachment 5 of this subpart), stating that the building has been built 
substantially in accordance with the drawings and specifications. The 
builder will also provide a certification that the onsite work complies 
with drawings, specifications, and the applicable development standard 
(eExhibit B, attachment 5 of this subpart).
    (d) Responsibility for field inspections will be in accordance with 
Sec. 1924.9(a) of this subpart. Frequency and timing of inspections will 
be in accordance with Sec. 1924.9(b) of this subpart, except that the 
Stage 2 inspection should be made during the time and in no case later 
than two working days after the crews commence work on the site and the 
house is being erected or placed on the foundation, to determine 
compliance with the accepted drawings and specifications.
    (e) Periodic plant inspections will be performed in accordance with 
paragraphs II and III of exhibit B of this subpart. FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 employees responsible for 
inspections in the area in which the manufacturing plant or material 
supply yard is located will perform such inspections as deemed necessary 
under paragraph III of exhibit B of this subpart.
    (1) Plant inspections will be made if the type construction method 
used could restrict adequate inspections on the building site.
    (2) Plant inspections will be made as often as necessary; however, 
after initial inspection and acceptance of the unit, only when it 
appears advisable to ascertain the performance and continuing stability 
of accepted materials and construction.
    (f) Only one contract will be accepted for the completed house on 
the site owned or to be bought by the borrower. The manufacturer of the 
house or the manufacturer's agent may be the prime contractor for 
delivery and erection of the house on the site or a builder may contract 
with the borrower for the complete house in place on the site. Such 
contracts should provide that payments will be made only for work in 
place on the borrower's site.
    (g) Payments for modular/panelized units will be made in accordance 
with the terms of the contract and in compliance with Sec. 1924.6(a)(12) 
of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.9  Inspection of development work.

    The following policies will govern the inspection of all development 
work.
    (a) Responsibility for inspection. The County Supervisor or District 
Director, accompanied by the borrower when practicable, will make final 
inspection of all development work and periodic inspections as 
appropriate to protect the security interest of the government. In this 
respect, inspections other than final inspections, may be conducted by 
other qualified persons as authorized in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, in Sec. 1944.17(a)(2)(iii) of FmHA Instruction 2024-A 
(available in any RECD field office), and as authorized

[[Page 103]]

under other agreements executed by, or authorized by, the National 
Office.

The borrower will be responsible for making inspections necessary to 
protect the borrower's interest. RHS or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 inspections are not to assure the borrower that the 
house is built in accordance with the plans and specifications. The 
inspections create or imply no duty or obligation to the particular 
borrower. RHS or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
inspections are for the dual purpose of determining that RHS or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has adequate security for its 
loan and is achieving the statutory goal of providing adequate housing. 
If difficult technical problems are encountered, the County Supervisor 
or District Director should request the assistance of the State Office 
or a qualified technician from SCS or the State University Cooperative 
Extension Service.
    (b) Frequency of inspections. The County Supervisor or District 
Director will inspect development work as frequently as necessary to 
assure that construction and land development conforms to the drawings 
and specifications. The final inspection will be made at the earliest 
possible date after completion of the planned development. When several 
major items of development are involved, final inspection will be made 
upon completion of each item.
    (1) For new buildings and additions to existing buildings, 
inspections will be made at the following stages of construction and at 
such other stages of construction as determined by the County Supervisor 
or District Director except as modified by paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (i) Stage 1. Customarily, the initial inspection in construction 
cases is made just prior to or during the placement of concrete footings 
or monolithic footings and floor slabs. At this point, foundation 
excavations are complete, forms or trenches and steel are ready for 
concrete placement and the subsurface installation is roughed in. 
However, when it is not practicable to make the initial inspection prior 
to or during the placement of concrete, the County Supervisor or 
District Director will make the initial inspection as soon as possible 
after the placement of concrete and before any backfill is in place.
    (ii) Stage 2. The Stage 2 inspection will be made when the building 
is enclosed, structural members are still exposed, roughing in for 
heating, plumbing, and electrical work is in place and visible, and wall 
insulation and vapor barriers are installed. Customarily, this is prior 
to installation of brick veneer or any interior finish which would 
include lath, wallboard and finish flooring.
    (iii) Stage 3. The final inspection will be made when all on-site 
and off-site development has been completed and the structure is ready 
for occupancy or its intended use.
    (2) For rehabilitation of existing buildings, inspections will be 
made in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section, and at such other stages of construction to assure that 
construction is being performed in a professional manner and in 
accordance with the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 approved drawings and specifications.
    (3) For new construction when the structure will be covered by an 
insured 10-year warranty plan as described in exhibit L of this subpart, 
only the final inspection is required, except in cases when partial 
payments are required when the provisions of Sec. 1924.6(a)(12)(v) of 
this subpart will be followed.
    (4) Arrangements should be made to have the borrower join the County 
Supervisor or the District Director in making periodic inspections as 
often as necessary to provide a mutual understanding with regard to the 
progress and performance of the work.
    (5) The Borrower should make enough periodic visits to the site to 
be familiar with the progress and performance of the work, in order to 
protect the borrower's interest. If the borrower observes or otherwise 
becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or nonconformance with 
the contract documents, the borrower should give prompt written notice 
thereof to the contractor with a copy to the County Supervisor or 
District Director responsible for servicing the type of loan or grant 
involved.

[[Page 104]]

    (6) The borrower should, when practicable, join the County 
Supervisor or District Director in making all final inspections.
    (7) When irrigation equipment and materials are to be purchased and 
installed, a performance test under actual operating conditions by the 
person or firm making the installation should be required before final 
acceptance is made. The test should be conducted in the presence of the 
borrower, a qualified technician, and, when practicable, the County 
Supervisor or District Director. If the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 official is not present at the performance 
test, he or she should request the technician to furnish a report as to 
whether or not the installation meets the requirements of the plans and 
specifications.
    (8) For irrigation and drainage construction or any dwelling 
construction where part or all of the work will be buried or backfilled, 
interim inspections should be made at such stages of construction that 
compliance with plans and specifications can be determined.
    (c) Recording inspections and correction of deficiencies. All 
periodic and final inspections made by the County Supervisor or District 
Director will be recorded on Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-12 in accordance with the FMI. The County 
Supervisor or District Director will be responsible for following up on 
the correction of deficiencies reported on Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-12. When an architect/engineer is 
providing services on a project, the District Director should notify the 
architect/engineer immediately of any fault or defect observed in the 
work or of any nonconformance with the contract document. If the 
borrower or the contractor refuses to correct the deficiencies, the 
District Director will report the facts to the State Director who will 
determine the action to be taken. No inspection will be recorded as a 
final inspection until all deficiencies or nonconforming conditions have 
been corrected.
    (d) Acceptance by responsible public authority. When local (city) 
county, state, or other public authority) codes and ordinances require 
inspections, final acceptance by the local authority having jurisdiction 
will be required prior to final inspection or acceptance by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (e) Acceptance by project architect. If architectural services 
pursuant to Sec. 1924.13(a) of this subpart have been obtained, final 
acceptance by the project architect pursuant to Sec. 1924.13(a)(5)(v) of 
this subpart will be required prior to acceptance by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354.

Sec. 1924.10  Making changes in the planned development.

    The borrower may request changes in the planned development in 
accordance with this section.
    (a) Authority of the County Supervisor. The County Supervisor is 
authorized to approve changes in the planned development involving loans 
and grants within the County Supervisor's approval authority provided:
    (1) The change is for an authorized purpose and within the scope of 
the original proposal.
    (2) Sufficient funds are deposited in the borrower's supervised bank 
account or with the interim lender, as appropriate, to cover the 
contemplated changes when the change involves additional funds to be 
furnished by the borrower.
    (3) The change will not adversely affect the soundness of the 
operation or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's 
security. If uncertain as to the probable effect the change would have 
on the soundness of the operation or FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 security, the County Supervisor will obtain advice 
from the District Director on whether to approve the change.
    (4) If a surety bond has been provided on the full amount of the 
construction contract, the aggregate amount of all contract change 
orders on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-7, ``Contract Change Order,'' or other acceptable form will not 
exceed 20 percent of the original

[[Page 105]]

contract amount. Change orders for contracts on which a surety bond has 
been provided which increases the original contract amount by more than 
20 percent may only be approved if additional surety is provided in the 
full revised amount of the contract. For purposes of this paragraph, 
letters of credit and deposits are not considered surety.
    (5) Change orders for contracts on which letters of credit or 
deposits have been provided on the full amount of the contract which 
will increase the original contract amount are approved only if 
additional letters of credit or deposits are provided in the full 
revised amount of the contract.

    (b) Authority of the District Director. The District Director is 
authorized to approve changes in the development planned with RRH, RCH, 
and RHS loans and LH loans and grants within the District Director's 
approval authority, provided the conditions in Sec. 1924.10(a) have been 
met. For such loans in excess of the District Director's approval 
authority, the borrower's request with the District Director's 
recommendation will be forwarded to the State Director for 
consideration.
    (c) Recording changes in the planned development. (1) Changes should 
be accomplished only after FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 written approval. Changes will not be included in payment 
requests until approved by the borrower; the contractor, if applicable; 
the architect/engineer, if applicable; and the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 loan approval official. Examples of 
changes requiring documentation are:
    (i) Any changes in labor and materials and their respective costs.
    (ii) Changes in facility design.

Sec. 1924.11  District Director's review of incomplete development.

    During monthly District Office work organization meetings and during 
regular visits to the County Office, the District Director will review 
the progress that is being made in completing development financed with 
loans within the District Director's and County Supervisor's 
responsibility.
    (a) Once each year the District Director will make a comprehensive 
review of all development work not completed within the time scheduled. 
For incomplete development financed with loan or grant funds within the 
responsibility of the District Director, the District Director will take 
the necessary actions to assure that the borrower or grantee completes 
the planned development. For incomplete development financed with loan 
or grant funds within the responsibility of the County Supervisor, the 
District Director will give the necessary direction to the County 
Supervisor to assure completion of the work. In connection with these 
responsibilities, the District Director will consider:

[[Page 106]]

    (1) The current farm and home operations with respect to the need 
for the development as originally planned.
    (2) Revisions to the development plan.
    (3) Funds remaining in the supervised bank account.
    (4) Need for additional funds.
    (5) Personal funds that could be furnished by the borrower.
    (6) Estimated completion dates.
    (7) The borrower's attitude with respect to completing the 
development.
    (b) After a complete review of the status of development in both the 
District and County Offices has been made, the District Director will 
make a written report to the State Director which will include 
observations and recommendations regarding incomplete development. The 
report may be included in the District Director's regular report, and 
will include:
    (1) The number of cases in which borrowers have not completed their 
development within 9, 15 or 24 months when authorized, and also the 
number of cases in which funds have been exhausted and the work is 
incomplete.
    (2) The number of borrowers who have not completed their development 
within 3 years from the loan closing, and indicate the action that was 
taken in each such case.
    (c) If the borrower has not completed development work within 3 
years after the date of loan closing and the District Director has 
determined that the borrower cannot or will not complete the 
development, the District Director will so indicate on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-1 and request the State 
Director to withdraw, for application on the loan, any unused 
development funds remaining in the borrower's supervised bank account, 
if the borrower will not sign a check for a refund to the loan account.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.12  Warranty of development work.

    (a) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-
19, ``Builder's Warranty,'' or an insured 10-year home warranty as 
described in exhibit L of this subpart, and normal trade warranties on 
items of equipment will be issued to the borrower at the completion of 
new building construction, dwelling rehabilitation by the contract 
method, all cases of newly completed and previously unoccupied dwellings 
or construction under conditional commitments issued to builders and 
sellers.
    (b) If the warranty is not an insured 10-year warranty, a completed 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-19, with 
warranty protection for 1 year, must be provided by the builder upon 
final acceptance of the work by the owner and FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354. If an insured 10-year warranty is 
provided, the requirements of exhibit L of this subpart apply, and a 
copy of the warranty insurance policy or a binder must have been 
received by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 prior 
to disbursement of the final payment to the builder.
    (c) If, for some reason, the warranty insurance policy cannot be 
issued, the contractor will be required to execute Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-19 and the case will be 
forwarded to the State Director for consideration of debarment under the 
provisions of subpart M of part 1940 (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). The County Supervisor 
will assist the borrower to the extent necessary under the provisions of 
the warranty and subpart F of part 1924 of this chapter.
    (d) The County Supervisor will take the following action prior to 
the expiration of the first year of the warranty period:
    (1) As soon as the warranty has been executed, the follow-up date 
for sending Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-21, ``Notice of Expiration of First Year of Warranty,'' which will 
be used for the 1 year warranty or the first year of the insured 10-year 
warranty, will be posted to the ``Servicing and Supervision'' section of 
the Management System card.
    (2) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-
21 is provided for use in notifying the borrower of the expiration date 
of the first year of the warranty. This letter will

[[Page 107]]

be mailed to the borrower early in the second month preceding the 
expiration date of the first year of the warranty period.
    (3) If the County Supervisor or District Director does not hear from 
the borrower within 30 days, it can reasonably be assumed that no 
complaint exists or that any complaint has been satisfied unless 
information to the contrary has been received.
    (4) If the borrower notifies FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 that any complaint has not been satisfied, an onsite 
inspection shall be made as early as possible, but not later than 1 
month preceding the expiration date of the first year of the warranty. 
The results of the inspection will be recorded on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-12. If the borrower has 
complaints, the case should be handled in accordance with the provisions 
of subpart F of part 1924 of this chapter, or as otherwise provided in 
this subpart.

Sec. 1924.13  Supplemental requirements for more complex construction.

    This section includes additional provisions that apply to planning 
and conduct of construction work on all multiple family housing projects 
and other projects that are more extensive in scope and more complex in 
nature than individual housing units or farm buildings. This section 
will apply in addition to all other requirements contained elsewhere in 
this subpart.
    (a) Architectural services. Complete architectural services, as 
defined in Sec. 1924.4(o)(1) of this subpart are recommended on all 
projects. They are required for projects involving an LH grant and for 
all loans for RRH, RCH, and LH projects consisting of more than 4 units 
unless prior consent to making an exception to the requirements for 
complete architectural services is obtained from the National Office. If 
the applicant or contractor is an architect or organization with 
architectural capability, the applicant must, nevertheless, hire an 
independent qualified architect or architectural firm to inspect the 
construction work and perform other needed services during the 
construction and warranty phases. See Guide 4, attachment 1, 
``Attachment to AIA Document--Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner 
and Architect,'' for further information (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (1) Exception. Any request for National Office consent to an 
exception being made for complete architectural services should include 
the proposed drawings and specifications, method of providing specific 
services, the comments and recommendations of the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 State Architect, and any other pertinent 
information. The State Director must determine that any services for 
which an exception is requested can be performed by qualified State or 
District Office staff members.
    (2) Selecting the architect. The applicant is responsible for 
selecting the architect. The District Director with the advice of the 
State architect/engineer should discuss with the applicant the selection 
of the architect for the job as early as possible to assist in the site 
selection and participate in early consultations regarding project scope 
and design.
    (3) Architectural fees. Fees for architectural services shall not 
exceed the fee ordinarily charged by the profession for similar work 
when FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financing is 
not involved. The fee should cover only the architectural services 
rendered by the architect. The reduction or elimination of any services 
described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section shall be directly 
reflected in the fee. Fees for special services rendered by the 
architects, such as the packaging of the loan application or additional 
nonarchitectural services, will not be authorized to be paid with loan 
funds.
    (4) Agreement between borrower and architect. The borrower and the 
architect will execute a written agreement. The agreement must provide:
    (i) The services listed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (ii) The amount of the fee and how it will be determined and paid.

[[Page 108]]

    (iii) That the agreement and any amendments to the agreement shall 
not be in full force and effect until concurred with in writing by the 
State Director or the State Director's delegate, and it will contain the 
following provision:

    The Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354, as potential lender or insurer of funds to defray the costs 
of this agreement and without liability for any payments thereunder, 
hereby concurs in the form, content and the execution of this agreement.

    (5) Specific services. Architectural services will include six 
consecutive phases as follows:
    (i) Schematic design phase. The architect will:
    (A) Consult with the applicant to obtain available information 
pertinent to the project requirements.
    (B) Consult with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 State architect/engineer about FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 requirements and procedures.
    (C) Assist in preparing the project design after analyzing 
engineering and survey data on the site selected by applicant.
    (D) Prepare schematic design studies consisting of drawings and 
other documents illustrating the scale and relationship of project 
components for the applicant's approval.
    (E) Submit estimates of current development costs based on current 
area, volume, or other unit costs.
    (F) When the applicant and FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 have accepted the schematic design studies and estimated 
development costs, the project architect may be authorized to proceed 
with the next phase.
    (ii) Design development phase. The architect will:
    (A) Prepare the design development exhibits from the accepted 
schematic design studies for approval by the applicant. These exhibits 
should consist of drawings and other documents to fix and describe the 
size and character of the entire project as to structural, mechanical, 
and electrical systems, materials, and other essentials as appropriate.
    (B) Submit a further statement of probable construction cost.
    (C) Obtain applicant and FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 approval of drawings, specifications, and authorization to 
proceed with next phase.
    (iii) Construction documents phase. The architect will:
    (A) Prepare the working drawings and specifications from the 
approved design development drawings and set forth in detail the 
requirements for the construction of the entire project in accordance 
with applicable regulations and codes; for example, necessary bidding 
information, assistance in preparing bidding forms, conditions of the 
construction contract, and the form of agreement between applicant/owner 
and contractor.
    (B) Submit a final and more comprehensive statement of probable 
development cost. It should show a breakdown of the estimated total 
development cost of the project and the various trades in enough detail 
for an adequate review.
    (C) Obtain the acceptance of the applicant and FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 for contract documents, including 
approval of the final drawings and specifications and authorization to 
proceed.
    (D) Discuss with the applicant various items as they develop.
    (iv) Bidding or negotiation phase. The architect will, as 
appropriate, for a bidded or negotiated contract:
    (A) Assist in review and selection of bidders and submission of 
contract documents to selected bidders.
    (B) Assist in the interpretation of drawings and specifications, and 
other contract documents.
    (C) Receive and tabulate all bids.
    (D) Review the bids and the negotiated proposals and assist in the 
award and preparation of construction contracts.
    (v) Construction phase. This phase includes the administration of 
the construction contract. It will commence with the award of the 
construction contract and end when the borrower

[[Page 109]]

makes final payment to the contractor. The architect will:
    (A) Attend the preconstruction conference. Advise and consult with 
the borrower (or the borrower's representative) and issue the borrower's 
instructions to the contractor.
    (B) Prepare change orders.
    (C) Keep construction accounts and work as the general administrator 
of the project during construction.
    (D) Interpret the contract documents and have the authority to 
reject all work and materials which do not comply.
    (E) Review and approve shop drawings, samples, and other submissions 
of the contractor for conformance with the design concept and for 
compliance with the contract documents.
    (F) Conduct periodic inspections of all phases of construction to 
determine compliance with the contract documents and certify as to the 
amount is in place and materials suitably stored on site for partial 
payment estimates. These inspections will be augmented, when necessary, 
by inspections performed by structural, mechanical, and electrical 
representatives. Periodic inspections should be made as frequently as is 
necessary to verify that the work conforms with the intent of the 
contract documents and that a high quality of workmanship is maintained. 
The State Director may require a full-time project representative on 
projects with a total development cost of $750,000 or more, when in the 
opinion of the State Director there is a need for such representative, 
and the State Director states the reasons for such need to the borrower.
    (G) Determine, based on the inspections, the dates of substantial 
completion and final completion; receive on the borrower's behalf all 
written guarantees and related documents assembled by the contractor; 
and issue a final certificate for payment.
    (vi) Warranty phase. The architect will advise and consult with the 
borrower, as the borrower's representative, about items to be corrected 
within the warranty period. The architect will accompany the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 representative during the 
inspection required one month prior to expiration of the warranty 
period.
    (b) Other professional services. The State Director, on the 
recommendation of the State architect/engineer, may request that 
additional professional services be provided.
    (1) Professional services typically include soils engineering, 
structural engineering, civil engineering, surveying, land planning, or 
professional cost estimation or certification. Fees for these services 
may be paid directly by the borrower or by the architect as reimbursable 
expenses.
    (2) When a project representative is utilized, unless otherwise 
agreed, the representative will be provided by the consulting architect/
engineer. Prior to the preconstruction conference, the architect/
engineer will submit a resume of qualifications of the project 
representative to the applicant and to FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 for acceptance in writing. If the applicant 
provided the project representative, the applicant must submit a resume 
of the representative's qualifications to the project architect/engineer 
and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for acceptance 
in writing, prior to the preconstruction conference. The project 
representative will attend the preconstruction conference where duties 
and responsibilities will be fully discussed. The project representative 
will work under the general supervision of the architect/engineer. The 
project representative will maintain a daily diary in accordance with 
the following:
    (i) The diary shall be maintained in a hard-bound book.
    (ii) The diary shall have all pages numbered and all entries in ink.
    (iii) All entries shall be on daily basis, beginning with the date 
and weather conditions.
    (iv) Daily entries shall include daily work performed, number of men 
and equipment used in the performance of the work, and all significant 
happenings during the day.
    (v) The diary shall be made available to FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel and will be reviewed during 
project inspections.

[[Page 110]]

    (vi) The project representative's diary will become the property of 
the owner after the project is accepted and final payments are made.
    (c) Drawings. The type and kinds of drawings should be in accordance 
with exhibit C of this subpart and subpart D of part 1944 of this 
chapter.
    (1) The drawings must be clear, accurate, with adequate dimensions 
and of sufficient scale for estimating purposes.
    (2) Construction sections and large-scale details sufficient for 
accurate bidding and for the purpose of correlating all parts of the 
work should be part of the general drawings. This is particularly 
important where the size of a project makes necessary the preparation of 
the general drawings at a scale of 1/8 inch equals 1 foot or less.
    (3) Mechanical and electrical work should be shown on separate 
plans.
    (4) Schedules should be provided for doors, windows, finishes, 
electrical fixtures, finish hardware, and any other specialty items 
necessary to clarify drawings.
    (d) Specifications. Trade-type specifications (specifications 
divided into sections for various trades) should be used. The 
specifications should be complete, clear, and concise, with adequate 
description of the various classes of work shown under the proper 
sections and headings.
    (e) Methods of administering construction. Projects involving a 
total development cost of less than $100,000 which do not include an LH 
grant may, with the approval of the State Director, follow the contract 
procedure in Sec. 1924.6(a) of this subpart without modification. 
Construction of all other projects, however, will be administered by the 
contract method or owner-builder method as set forth in this section.
    (1) Contract method. This method of development will be used for all 
complex construction except in cases where owner-builder method is 
authorized. Development under this method is done in accordance with 
Sec. 1924.6(a) of this subpart except as modified by this paragraph. All 
construction work will be completed under one written construction 
contract. Guide 1, ``Contract Documents,'' of this subpart (available in 
any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) is 
provided to assist FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
personnel and applicants in assembling and reviewing contract documents 
for more complex construction such as that administered under this 
section.
    (i) Competitive bidding methods. (A) All construction contracts must 
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding unless an exception is 
granted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section thereby 
permitting contract negotiation. The applicant's architect should 
prepare the bidding documents. Public notice must be given inviting all 
interested bidders to submit a bid. Prospective bidders may be contacted 
asking for their bids; however, public notice is necessary so that all 
local contractors have the opportunity to submit bids.
    (B) A bid bond is required from each bidder in the amount of 5 
percent of the bid price as assurance that the bidder will, upon 
acceptance of the bid, execute the required contract documents within 
the time specified.
    (C) The construction contract will be awarded based on the contract 
cost, and all conditions listed in the ``Invitation to Bid.''
    (D) If advertising does not provide a satisfactory bid in the 
opinion of the applicant and FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354, the applicant shall reject all bids and will then be free 
to negotiate with bidders on anyone else to obtain a satisfactory 
contract. The following conditions must be met:
    (1) The State Director determines that the original competitive bid 
process was handled in a satisfactory manner and that there is no 
advantage to advertising for competitive bid again.
    (2) The requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this section are 
met.
    (E) If there is no agreement by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 and the applicant as to the construction cost, the 
State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and 
inform the applicant of the right to appeal in accordance with subpart B 
of part 1900 of this chapter.
    (ii) Contract documents. Contract documents will conform with 
recognized

[[Page 111]]

professional practices as prescribed in this paragraph. Such contract 
documents will contain substantially the following:

Item I  Invitation for Bids (Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-5)
Item II  Information for Bidders
Item III  Bid
Item IV  Bid Bond
Item V  Agreement (Construction Contract)
Item VI  Compliance Statement (Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 400-6)

Item XVIII  Partial Payment Estimate (Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1924-18)
Item XIX  Builder's Warranty (Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-19)

    (A) Substitution of term ``architect'' for ``engineer'' may be 
necessary on some of the forms. Other modifications may be necessary in 
some cases to conform to the nature and extent of the project. All such 
contract documents and related items will be concurred with by the State 
Director, with the assistance of OGC prior to the release of invitations 
to bid.
    (B) Items listed as I through IV and item XI of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) 
of this section may be omitted when an exception to the competitive 
bidding requirement is granted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(vii) 
of this section, thereby permitting a negotiated contract.
    (C) All negotiated contracts shall include a provision to the effect 
that the borrower, USDA, the Comptroller General of the United States, 
or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to 
any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are 
directly pertinent to a specific Federal loan program for the purpose of 
making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.
    (D) A provision of liquidated damages will be included in all 
contracts. The liquidated damage amount must be reasonable and represent 
the best estimate possible of how much interest or other costs will 
accrue on the loan, and also represent any loss of rent or other income 
which would result from a delay in the completion of the project beyond 
the estimated completion date.
    (E) All contracts shall include a provision for compliance with the 
Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in 
Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). This Act prohibits 
anyone from inducing any person in connection with the construction to 
give up any part of the compensation to which the person is otherwise 
entitled.
    (F) All contracts will contain a certification by the applicant 
indicating that there is not now nor will there be an identity of 
interest between the applicant and any of the following: Contractor, 
architect, engineer, attorney, subcontractors, material suppliers, 
equipment lessors, or any of their members, directors, officers, 
stockholders, partners, or beneficiaries unless specifically identified 
to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in writing 
prior to the award of the contract. All contracts must also indicate 
that when any identity of interest exists or comes into being, the 
contractor agrees to have construction costs as reported to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 on Form 1924-13, ``Estimate 
and Certificate of Actual Cost,'' audited by a Certified Public 
Accountant (CPA) or Licensed Public Accountant (LPA) licensed prior to 
December 31, 1970, who will provide an opinion as to whether the Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-13 presents 
fairly the costs of construction in conformity with eligible 
construction costs as prescribed in FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 regulations.
    (G) All contracts on any form other than Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-6,

[[Page 112]]

must contain the language of clause (D) of Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-6, which is available in all FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 offices. The language 
of clause (D) of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1924-6 sets forth the Notice of Requirement for Affirmative Action 
to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity required by Executive Order 
11246, the Equal Opportunity clause published at 41 CFR 60-1.4 (a) and 
(b), and the Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Construction 
Contract Specifications required by Executive Order 11246. For contract 
forms other than Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1924-6, Form AD 767, ``Equal Employment Opportunity Contract 
Compliance Notices,'' which can be obtained from the Finance Office, 
should be attached and made a part of the contract.
    (H) All contracts will contain a provision that they are not in full 
force and effect until concurred with by the State Director or the State 
Director's delegate, in writing. Therefore, before loan closing or 
before the start of construction, whichever occurs first, the State 
Director or the State Director's delegate will concur in the contract 
form, content, and execution if acceptable, by including the following 
paragraph at the end of the contract:

    The Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354, as potential lender or insurer of funds to defray to costs 
of this contract, and without liability for any payments thereunder, 
hereby concurs in the form, content, and execution of this contract.

Title

    (I) The requirements of Sec. 1924.6 (a)(11)(iv) of this subpart 
apply to all contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000.
    (iii) Surety. When multiple advances of loan or grant funds are 
utilized, surety that guarantees both payment and performance in the 
full amount of the contract will be provided in accordance with 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(ii) of this subpart. Exceptions to the surety 
requirements shall be governed by the following:
    (A) In accordance with the guidance and recommendations of OMB 
Circulars A-102 and A-110, exceptions to the surety requirements of 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(ii) of this subpart will not be granted for nonprofit 
organization or public body applicants.
    (B) For loans or grants to applicants other than non-profit 
organizations or public bodies that are within the State Director's 
approval authority, the State Director may, upon request of the borrower 
or grantee, grant exceptions to the surety requirements in accordance 
with the provisions of Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) of this subpart. Before 
granting such an exception, however, the State Director should be 
provided the following information from the proposed contractor in order 
to fully evaluate the experience and capabilities of the contractor:
    (1) A resume indicating the contractor's history, ability and 
experience.
    (2) A current, dated and signed financial statement of the 
contractor's operations indicating the payment status of accounts and 
any contingent liabilities that may exist. FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 personnel will be responsible for analyzing the 
financial statement as to the sufficiency of the contractor's financial 
capability to carry out construction. The financial strength must 
demonstrate the ability of the contractor to pay all bills prior to 
receiving periodic draws of funds from the lender.
    (3) A credit report (obtained at no expense to FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354) attesting to the contractor's credit 
standing.
    (4) A listing of trade references that could be contacted to 
substantiate the contractor's experience and good standing.
    (5) Statements from owners for whom the contractor has done similar 
work, indicating the scope of the work and the owner's evaluation of the 
contractor's performance.
    (C) For loans or grants to applicants other than non-profit 
organization or public bodies that are in excess of the State Director's 
approval authority,

[[Page 113]]

the State Director may request National Office authorization to grant 
one of the exceptions to the surety requirements as indicated in 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) of this subpart. The following information must 
be submitted with the request to the National Office:
    (1) An explanation of why interim financing is not available.
    (2) An explanation of why the proposed contractor cannot obtain 
surety bonds meeting the requirements of Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(ii) of this 
subpart.
    (3) The information listed in paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(B) of this 
section.
    (4) The drawings and specifications for the proposed project, 
together with the comments of the State architect/engineer.
    (5) The applicant's written request for an exception.
    (6) An explanation of why the requirements of Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) 
(A) or (B) of this subpart cannot be met in those cases where the State 
Director requests authorization to grant an exception as indicated in 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(iii)(C) of this subpart. When such a request is made, 
the documentation required of the contractor under the provision must 
also be forwarded.
    (7) The State Director's recommendation.
    (D) Adequate steps will be taken to protect the interests of the 
borrower and the government in accordance with the payment provisions of 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(12)(i) of this subpart and any alternative as outlined in 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(iii)(c) of this subpart.
    (iv) Contract cost breakdown. In any case where the loan approval 
official feels it appropriate, and prior to the award or approval of any 
contract in which there is an identity of interest as defined in 
Sec. 1924.4 (i) of this subpart, the contractor and any subcontractor, 
material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest 
must provide the applicant and FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 with a trade-item cost breakdown of the proposed contract 
amount for evaluation. The cost of any surety as required by 
Sec. 1944.222 (h) and (i) of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(3) of this subpart, or cost certification as required by 
paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section, will be included in the proposed 
contract amount and shown under General Requirements on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-13, which is available in 
all FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 offices. FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel will be 
responsible for reviewing the estimates on Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-13 to determine if the dollar 
amounts total correctly, to assure that costs are categorized under 
their appropriate columns, and to confirm that the estimated costs for 
all line items are reasonable and customary for the State.
    (v) Cost certification. Whenever the State Director determines it 
appropriate, and in all situations where there is an identity of 
interest as defined in Sec. 1924.4(i) of this subpart, the borrower, 
contractor and any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor 
having an identity of interest must each provide certification using 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-13 as to 
the actual cost of the work performed in connection with the 
construction contract. The construction costs, as reported on Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-13, must also be 
audited, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, by a CPA, or 
LPA licensed on or before December 31, 1970. In addition, certain agreed 
upon procedures (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 office) will be performed in accordance with 
Attestation Standards. In some cases, FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 will contract directly with a CPA or LPA for the cost 
certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs 
of construction certified by an FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 contractor that they were the actual costs of the 
work performed, as reported on Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-13, will be provided. Funds which were included 
in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed 
because FmHA or its successor

[[Page 114]]

agency under Public Law 103-354 contracts for the cost certification 
will be returned on the loan. FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 personnel will utilize exhibit M of this subpart (available 
in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) and 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-26, 
``Cost Certification Worksheet,'' to assist in the evaluation of the 
cost certification process.
    (A) Prior to the start of construction, the borrower, contractor and 
any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an 
identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting 
system that the borrower, contractor, subcontractor, material supplier 
or equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in 
maintaining a running record of the actual cost. In order to be 
acceptable, the borrower must provide a written assertion that it has an 
accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a trade-item 
basis comparison of the actual cost as compared to the estimated cost 
submitted on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item will be set up in the 
accounting system for that particular account. For instance, only costs 
of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor associated with concrete 
will be shown in the concrete account. The accounting system must also 
restrict costs to those pertaining to a specific project so that costs 
from multiple projects will not be co-mingled. The independent CPA or 
LPA shall report on the borrower's assertion in accordance with the 
Standards for Attestation Engagements of the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The borrower's and the CPA or 
LPA's reports on the accounting system shall be provided to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 by the borrower.
    (B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, a 
trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost compared to the estimated 
cost must be provided to the owner and FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be 
used, and contains the certifications required of the applicant and 
contractor prior to final payment. The amounts for builder's general 
overhead, builder's profit, and general requirements, respectively, 
shall not exceed the amounts represented on the estimate of cost 
breakdown provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this 
section for any contractor, subcontractor, material supplier, or 
equipment lessor having or sharing an identity of interest with the 
borrower. The amounts for general overhead, builder's profit, and 
general requirements must be established prior to FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 approving the construction contract and 
will not be changed during the course of construction. This applies to 
all contractors, subcontractors, material suppliers, or equipment 
lessors having or sharing an identity of interest with the applicant. 
Contract change orders will be processed to adjust the contract amount 
downward prior to the final payment to the contractor, if necessary, to 
assure that the amounts shown in the certificate of actual costs do not 
exceed the amounts represented in the contract cost breakdown. Reduction 
in the builder's profit, and general overhead if needed, will 
counterbalance any increase reflected in the contract costs. Any funds 
remaining as a result of hard cost savings will be applied to the 
account as an extra payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved 
by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as long as the 
improvements are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the 
project. All increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item 
costs will require documentation as to the reason for the increases and/
or decreases. The State Director may require documentation for increases 
and/or decreases of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines it 
necessary. This information will be required with the cost 
certification.
    (C) The CPA or LPA audit, performed in accordance with Government 
Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the accounting records 
and such

[[Page 115]]

other auditing procedures of the borrower and the contractor (and any 
subcontractor, material supplier or equipment lessor sharing an identity 
of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, and 
materials supplied in accordance with the construction contract he/she 
considers necessary to express an opinion on the construction costs as 
reported on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-13. The CPA or LPA shall also perform the additional agreed upon 
procedures specified by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 office), performed in accordance with Attestation Standards, for 
the applicant and the contractor (and any subcontractor, material 
supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest) 
concerning the work performed, services rendered, and materials supplied 
in accordance with the construction contract.
    (D) Upon completion of construction and prior to final payment, the 
CPA or LPA will provide an opinion concerning whether the construction 
costs, as reported on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1924-13, present fairly the costs of construction in conformity 
with eligible construction costs as prescribed in FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations.
    (E) In some cases, cost certification will be obtained by FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 through direct contract 
with the CPA or LPA. The borrower and his/her CPA or LPA will cooperate 
fully with the contract CPA or LPA by providing all documentation 
necessary to conduct the certification. FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 reserves the right to determine, upon receipt 
of the certified Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1924-13 and the auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. If not 
satisfactory to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, 
the borrower will be responsible for providing additional information.
    (F) There will exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA 
and the borrower except for the performance of the examination of the 
cost certification, accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any 
CPA or LPA who acts as the borrower's accountant (performing manual or 
automated bookkeeping services or maintains the official accounting 
records) will not be the same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project.
    (G) Forms FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-30, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate'' and FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-31, ``Identity of 
Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,'' provide written notification to the 
borrower that willful and intentional falsification of cost 
certification documents will result in debarment of all violators in 
accordance with the provisions of FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1940-M (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). These forms require 
the disclosure of all identities of interest associated with project 
construction, certify the entity's ability to provide the contracted 
service, and cite the penalties for failure to disclose or falsify such 
certification. Each applicant/borrower will be required to complete and 
sign the forms (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 office).
    (H) Subcontracting development work.
    (1) Contractors will not be allowed to obtain a profit and overhead 
unless they are performing actual construction. ``Actual construction'' 
means ``work'' as defined in American Institute of Architects (AIA) 
documents: ``* * * labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by 
the contractor to fulfill the contractor's obligations.'' Under this 
definition, contractors who choose to subcontract out construction of 
the project to another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee 
(general overhead and profit) when:
    (i) More than 50 percent of the contract sum in the construction 
contract is subcontracted to one subcontractor,

[[Page 116]]

material supplier, or equipment lessor, and/or
    (ii) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer 
subcontractors, material suppliers and/or equipment lessors.
    (2) Note: If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they 
are considered as one subcontractor.
    (3) How to apply rule:
    (i) The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of 
the largest subcontract by the contract sum of the construction contract 
results in more than 50 percent.
    (ii) The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the 
amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the contract sum of the 
construction contract results in 75 percent or more.
    (I) Qualified contracting entities. Contractors, subcontractors, 
material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an 
identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project 
must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified 
and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to 
contract. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities. The 
form provides notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, 
for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein. 
Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to 
disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1940-M 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office).
    (vi) Method of payments. Partial payments may be requested in 
accordance with the terms of the construction contract on Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-18, ``Partial Payment 
Estimate,'' or other professionally recognized form that contains the 
architect's certification, approval of the owner, and conditional 
acceptance of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as 
shown in Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-18.
    (A) If interim financing is available at reasonable rates and terms 
for the construction period, such financing shall be obtained. exhibit B 
of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter shall be used to inform the 
interim lender that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 will not close its loan until the project is substantially complete, 
ready for occupancy, evidence is furnished indicating that all bills 
have been paid or will be paid at loan closing for work completed on the 
project, all inspections have been completed and all required approvals 
have been obtained from municipal and governmental authorities having 
jurisdiction over the project.

Upon presentation of proper partial payment estimates approved by the 
applicant and accepted by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354, the interim lender may advance construction funds in accordance 
with the payment terms of the contract. It is suggested that partial 
payments not exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and 
materials suitably stored on site.
    (B) When interim financing is not available, payments will be made 
in accordance with Sec. 1924.6(a)(12) of this subpart.
    (vii) Exception to competitive bidding--(A) For all applicants. An 
applicant may negotiate a construction contract provided the State 
Director grants an exception and documentation shows that:
    (1) The contract price is competitive with other projects similar in 
construction and design being built in the area.
    (2) The proposed contractor is experienced in construction of 
projects of similar size, scope, and complexity, and is recognized as a 
reliable builder.
    (3) The proposed development work meets all requirements of this 
subpart.
    (4) If appropriate for nonprofit organizations and public bodies, 
the applicant provides a copy of a duly authorized resolution by its 
governing body requesting FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 to permit awarding the construction contract without formal 
bidding.
    (5) The applicant is permitted by state law, local law and/or 
organizational by-laws to negotiate a construction contract.

[[Page 117]]

    (6) The requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) 
of this section are met.
    (B) In considering an exception to competitive bidding, the 
following additional steps will be taken in all cases.
    (1) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate 
members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that 
the requirements have been met and the costs are reasonable, an 
exception to competitive bidding may be granted. Written documentation 
of the State Office review results will be placed in the application 
file.
    (2) If after the full review by the State Office staff, the State 
Director determines that the negotiated contract price is not 
competitive with other similar projects in construction and design being 
built in the area, the applicant will be requested to competitively bid 
the construction of the project in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) 
of this section.
    (3) If there is no agreement by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 and the applicant as to the construction cost, the 
State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication and 
inform the applicant of the right to appeal in accordance with subpart B 
of part 1900 of this chapter.
    (C) Any requests for exceptions to competitive bidding that are not 
covered in this section may be submitted to the National Office for 
consideration.
    (viii) Exception to contract method--public body. With the approval 
of the National Office, the State Director may grant to a public body an 
exception to the requirement for using contract method construction 
under the following circumstances:
    (A) The loan or grant is for repair or rehabilitation of existing 
facilities and it is not practicable to perform all work by the contract 
method.
    (B) The applicant has the managerial ability and qualified employees 
necessary to complete the work successfully.
    (C) That applicant submits a written request to the District 
Director indicating:
    (1) The scope of work and construction timetable;
    (2) What phases of work can be contracted and what cannot;
    (3) Why is it not practicable to contract all phases;
    (4) Management ability and employee qualifications for performing 
the work;
    (5) Proposed method of fund control and frequency of payments;
    (6) How changes in scope of work and construction timetable will be 
approved; and,
    (7) Proposed method of certifying progress and requesting payments.
    (D) The request, recommendations of the District Director, 
appropriate members of the State Office staff and the State Director and 
the application file will be sent to the National Office.
    (2) Owner-builder method. This method of development is used only 
when requested by profit or limited profit RRH applicants when the 
applicant or any of its controlling principals (such as stockholders, 
members, partners other than limited partners, directors, or officers), 
are general contractors by profession, and will serve as the builder of 
the project without a written construction contract. The State Director 
may make an exception to the contract method of construction and 
authorize proceeding by the owner-builder method of construction in 
accordance with the provisions of this section if the amount of the 
loan(s) does not exceed the State Director's approval authority. For 
projects over the State Director's authority, prior written consent of 
the National Office is required. In such cases, the drawings, 
specifications, cost estimates, copy of the State Architect/Engineer's 
review and detailed information on the applicant's qualifications will 
be submitted to the National Office along with the State Director's 
recommendations.
    (i) The applicant's request to construct a project by the owner-
builder method of construction shall be in the form of a letter giving 
specific and detailed information concerning the owner-builder's 
proposal, and the qualifications and past experience of the owner-
builder. The following information must be included with the request:

[[Page 118]]

    (A) A resume indicating the owner-builder's history, ability, and 
experience.
    (B) Dated and signed financial statements on the owner-builder's 
operation (including balance sheets and statements of income and 
expense) from current and prior years indicating the payment status of 
the owner-builder's accounts and any contingent liabilities that may 
exist. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel 
will be responsible for analyzing the financial statement as to the 
sufficiency of the owner-builder's financial capability to carry out 
construction. The financial strength must demonstrate the ability of the 
owner-builder to pay all bills prior to receiving periodic draws of 
funds from the lender.
    (C) A written, dated, and signed statement agreement to provide any 
funds necessary in excess of the applicant's contribution and the loan 
amount to complete the project.
    (D) A credit report (obtained at no expense to FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354) attesting to the owner-builder's credit 
standing.
    (E) A listing of trade references that could be contacted to 
substantiate the owner-builder's experience and good standing.
    (F) Statements from other persons for whom the owner-builder has 
done similar work, indicating the scope of the work and that person's 
evaluation of the owner-builder's performance.
    (G) A current, dated, and signed trade-item cost breakdown of the 
estimated total development cost of the project which has been prepared 
by the applicant/owner-builder. Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-13 will be used for this purpose. If cost 
certification services are required by FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354, the cost of such services may be included in 
the total development cost of the project. Any subcontractor, material 
supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest with the 
applicant/owner-builder as defined in Sec. 1924.4(i) of this subpart 
must also provide a trade-item cost breakdown of the proposed amount.
    (H) Prior to the start of construction, the owner-builder and any 
subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an 
identity of interest must submit, to the CPA or LPA, the accounting 
system that the owner-builder, subcontractor, material supplier or 
equipment lessor and/or the CPA or LPA proposes to set up and use in 
maintaining a running record of the actual cost. In order to be 
acceptable, the owner-builder must provide a written assertion that it 
has an accounting system that is suitably designed to provide for a 
trade-item basis comparison of the actual cost as compared to the 
estimated cost submitted on Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-13. Costs pertaining to a specific line item 
will be set up in the accounting system for that particular account. For 
instance, only costs of materials, supplies, equipment, and labor 
associated with concrete will be shown in the concrete account. The 
accounting system must also restrict costs to those pertaining to a 
specific project so that costs from multiple projects will not be co-
mingled. The independent CPA or LPA shall report on the owner-builder's 
assertion in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements 
of the AICPA. The owner-builder's and the CPA or LPA's reports on the 
accounting system shall be provided to FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 by the owner-builder.
    (I) A written, dated, and signed statement agreeing to permit U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, the Comptroller General of the United States, 
or any of their duly authorized representatives, to have access to any 
books, documents, papers, and records which are directly pertinent to 
the specific Federal program for the purpose of making audit, 
examination, excerpts and transcriptions.
    (ii) In order to grant an exception to the contract method of 
construction and proceed with the owner-builder method of construction, 
the State Director must determine that the following conditions exist:
    (A) The applicant or at least one of its principals is a fully 
qualified and licensed (if necessary under applicable

[[Page 119]]

local law) builder by profession, has adequate experience in 
constructing the type of units proposed as well as projects of similar 
size, scope, and complexity and will be able to complete the work in 
accordance with the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 approved drawings and specifications.
    (B) Based upon the information presented in the applicant's 
financial statements, the applicant is presently able and is likely to 
continue to be able to provide any funds necessary in excess of the 
applicant's contribution and the loan amount to complete the project.
    (C) The total development cost of the project does not exceed that 
which is typical for similar type projects in the area. The total 
development cost recognized by FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 for each individual case will be determined by the MFH 
Coordinator with the advice of the State Architect.
    (D) The owner-builder has provided sufficient information on all 
contracts or subcontracts in excess of $10,000 to permit compliance with 
Sec. 1924.6(a)(11)(iv) of this subpart.
    (iii) In addition to the requirements for the State Director to 
authorize the owner-builder method of construction as indicated in 
Sec. 1924.13(e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this subpart, the following 
additional steps will be taken by the State Director.
    (A) If, after a full review of the case documents by the appropriate 
members of the State Office staff, the State Director determines that 
the requirements have been met and the construction cost is reasonable, 
an exception to competitive bidding may be granted. Written 
documentation of the State Office review results will be placed in the 
application file.
    (B) If, after the full review by the State Office staff, the State 
Director determines that the construction cost is not competitive with 
other similar projects in construction and design being built in the 
area, the applicant will be requested to competitively bid the 
construction of the project in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of 
this section.
    (C) If there is no agreement by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 and the applicant as to construction cost and the 
applicant is not agreeable to any of the aforementioned alternatives, 
the State Director will cease any further action on the preapplication 
and inform the applicant of the right to appeal, in accordance with 
subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.
    (iv) The development cost of the project may include a typical 
allowance for general overhead, general requirements and a builder's 
profit. These amounts may be determined by local investigation and also 
from HUD data for the area. The applicant/owner-builder and any 
subcontractors, material suppliers and equipment lessors having or 
sharing an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder may not 
be permitted a builder's profit, general overhead, and general 
requirements which exceed the amounts represented on their cost 
breakdown.
    (v) Under no circumstances will loan funds be used to pay the owner/
builder or its stockholders, members, directors or officers, directly or 
indirectly, any profits from the construction of the project except a 
typical builder's fee for performing the services that would normally be 
performed by a general contractor under the contract method of 
construction. Discounts and rebates given the owner-builder in advance 
must be deducted before the invoices are paid. If discounts or rebates 
are given after the invoices are paid, the funds must be returned to the 
supervised bank account or applied on the interim construction loan, as 
appropriate. Under no circumstances will the dollar amount be placed in 
the reserve account.
    (vi) The plan and specifications must be specific and complete so 
that there is a clear understanding as to how the facility will be 
constructed and the materials that will be used.
    (vii) When architectural services are required by Sec. 1924.13(a) 
during the construction and warranty phases they must be provided by an 
architect who has no identity of interest with the applicant/owner-
builder. The services to be rendered during the construction and 
warranty phases include, but are

[[Page 120]]

not limited to inspections, changes in the scope of project or work to 
be done, administration of construction accounts, rejection of work and 
materials not conforming to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 approved drawings and specifications, and other 
appropriate service listed in Sec. 1924.13(a)(5) (v) and (vi) of this 
subpart.
    (viii) The applicant/owner-builder and any subcontractor, material 
supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an identity of interest as defined 
in Sec. 1924.4(i) of this subpart must each provide certification as to 
the actual cost of the work performed in connection with the 
construction of the project on Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-13 prior to final payment. The construction 
costs, as reported on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1924-13, must be audited by a CPA, or LPA licensed on or before 
December 31, 1970, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and 
certain agreed upon procedures (available in any FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 office) performed in accordance with 
Attestation Standards. In some cases, FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 will contract directly with a CPA or LPA for the cost 
certification. In that event, documentation necessary to have the costs 
of construction certified by an FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 contractor that they were the actual costs of the 
work performed, as reported on Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-13, will be provided. Funds which were included 
in the loan for cost certification and which are ultimately not needed 
because FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 contracts 
for the cost certification will be returned on the loan.
    (A) The CPA or LPA's audit, performed in accordance with Government 
Auditing Standards, will include such tests of the accounting records 
and such other auditing procedures of the applicant/owner-builder (and 
any subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an 
identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, 
and materials supplied in connection with the construction of the 
project he/she considers necessary to express an opinion on the 
construction costs as reported on Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1924-13. Upon completion of construction and 
prior to final payment, the CPA or LPA will provide an opinion as to 
whether the construction costs as reported on Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-13 present fairly the costs of 
construction in conformity with eligible construction costs as 
prescribed in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
regulations. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
reserves the right to determine, upon receipt of the certified Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-13 and the 
auditor's report, whether they are satisfactory to FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354. At a minimum, the CPA or LPA shall also 
perform any additional agreed upon procedures (available in any FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) specified by FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, performed in 
accordance with Attestation Standards, of the owner-builder (and any 
subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor sharing an 
identity of interest) concerning the work performed, services rendered, 
and materials supplied in connection with the construction. There will 
exist no business relationship between the CPA or LPA and the borrower 
except for the performance of the examination of the cost certification, 
accounting systems work, and tax preparation. Any CPA or LPA who acts as 
the borrower's accountant (performing manual or automated bookkeeping 
services or maintains the official accounting records) will not be the 
same CPA or LPA who cost certifies the project.
    (B) Prior to final payment to anyone required to cost certify, FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 must be provided with a 
certification and a trade-item breakdown showing the actual cost 
compared to the estimated cost furnished in accordance with paragraph 
(e)(2)(i)(G) of this

[[Page 121]]

section. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1924-13 is the form of comparative breakdown that must be used, and 
contains the certification required of the applicant/owner-builder prior 
to final payment. The amounts for builder's general overhead, general 
requirements, and builder's profit shall not exceed the amounts 
represented on the estimate of cost breakdown provided in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(G) of this section for the owner-builder or any 
subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor having or sharing 
an identity of interest with the applicant/owner-builder. Final payment 
to the owner-builder will be adjusted, if necessary, to assure that the 
amounts shown on the certificate of actual cost do not exceed the 
amounts represented on the cost breakdown. Any funds remaining as a 
result of hard cost savings will be applied to the account as an extra 
payment or used for eligible loan purposes approved by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as long as the improvements 
are genuinely needed and will enhance marketability of the project. All 
increases or decreases of 15 percent or more in line item costs will 
require documentation as to the reason for the increases or decreases. 
The State Director may require documentation for increases or decreases 
of less than 15 percent, if he/she determines it necessary. This 
information will be required with the cost certification.
    (C) Subcontracting development work.
    (1) Owner-builders will not be allowed to obtain a profit and 
overhead unless they are performing actual construction. ``Actual 
construction'' means ``work'' as defined in AIA documents: ``* * * 
labor, materials, equipment, and services provided by the contractor to 
fulfill the contractor's obligations.'' Under this definition, owner-
builders who choose to subcontract out construction of the project to 
another contractor will not obtain a builder's fee (general overhead and 
profit) when:
    (i) More than 50 percent of the total cost of the building 
construction is subcontracted to one subcontractor, material supplier, 
or equipment lessor, and/or
    (ii) Seventy-five percent or more with three or fewer 
subcontractors, material suppliers, and/or equipment lessors.
    (2) Note: If two or more subcontractors have common ownership, they 
are considered as one subcontractor.
    (3) How to apply rule:
    (i) The 50 percent rule will apply when division of the amount of 
the largest subcontract by the total amount of the building cost results 
in more than 50 percent.
    (ii) The 75 percent rule will apply when division of the sum of the 
amounts of the three largest subcontracts by the total building cost 
results in 75 percent or more.
    (D) Qualified contracting entities. Contractors, subcontractors, 
material suppliers, and any other individual or organization sharing an 
identity of interest and providing materials or services for the project 
must certify that it is a viable, ongoing trade or business qualified 
and properly licensed to undertake the work for which it intends to 
contract. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-31 will be prepared and executed by the contracting entities. The 
form provides notification to the entities of the penalty, under law, 
for erroneously certifying to the statements contained therein. 
Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to 
disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1940-M 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office).
    (ix) Requests for payment for work performed by the owner-builder 
method, shall be permitted to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 District Director for review and approval prior to 
each advance of funds in order to insure that funds are used for 
authorized purposes. Requests for payment shall be made on Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-18 or other 
professionally recognized form containing the following certification to 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354:

    The undersigned certifies that the work has been carefully inspected 
and to the best

[[Page 122]]

of their knowledge and belief, the quantities shown in this estimate are 
correct and the work has been performed in accordance with the contract 
documents.

    The review and acceptance of partial payment estimates by FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 does not attest to the 
correctness of the quantities shown or that the work has been performed 
in accordance with the plans and specifications.

    (A) If interim financing is available at reasonable rates and terms 
for the construction period, such financing shall be obtained. Exhibit B 
of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter shall be used to inform the 
interim lender that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 will not close its loan until the project is complete, ready for 
occupancy, evidence is furnished indicating that all bills have been 
paid for work completed on the project, all inspections have been 
completed and all required approvals have been obtained from any 
governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the project. Upon 
presentation of proper partial payment estimates containing an estimate 
of the value of work in place which has been prepared and executed by 
the owner-builder, certified by the applicant's architect, and accepted 
by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the interim 
lender may advance construction funds in accordance with the provisions 
of this section. It is suggested that the partial payment not exceed 90 
percent of the value of work in place and material suitably stored on 
site.
    (B) If interim financing is not available, partial payments not to 
exceed 90 percent of the value of work in place and materials suitably 
stored on site may be made to the owner-builder for that portion of the 
estimated cost of development guaranteed by a letter of credit or 
deposits meeting the requirements of Sec. 1924.6(a)(3)(iii) (A), (B) or 
(C) of this subpart. Partial payments may not exceed 60 percent of the 
value of work in place in all other cases. The determination of the 
value of work in place will be based upon an application for payment 
containing an estimate of the value of work in place which has been 
prepared and executed by the owner-builder, certified by the borrower's 
architect, and accepted by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354. Prior to receiving the first partial payment, the owner-builder 
must submit a schedule of prices or values of the various trades or 
phases of the work aggregating the total development cost of the project 
as required in Sec. 1924.13(e)(2)(i) (G) and (H) of this subpart. Each 
application for payment must be based upon this schedule, and show the 
total amount owed and paid to date for materials and labor procured in 
connection with the project. With each application for payment, the 
owner-builder must also submit evidence showing how the requested 
partial payment is to be applied, evidence showing that previous partial 
payments were properly applied, and a signed statement from the 
applicant's attorney, title insurance company, or local official in 
charge of recording documents certifying that the public records have 
been searched and that there are no liens of record. When the District 
Director has reason to believe that partial payments may not be applied 
properly, checks will be made payable to persons who furnish materials 
and labor for eligible purposes in connection with the project.
    (x) Under no circumstances shall funds be released for final payment 
or to pay any items of the builder's profit until the project is 100 
percent complete, ready for occupancy, and the owner-builder has 
completed and properly executed Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1924-13 or complied with the cost certification 
procedures of Sec. 1924.13(e)(2)(viii) of this subpart.

Exhibit B to Subpart A--Requirements for Modular/Panelized Housing Units

    For the benefit of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 this exhibit prescribes evaluation, acceptance, inspection and 
certification procedures formodular/panelized housing units proposed for 
use in Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Rural Housing programs. It applies to proposed 
development packages provided either under a contract between an FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 borrower and a single 
contractor or under a conditional commitment. This exhibit also 
describes the use of background information available through the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for analysis of 
manufactured products. This exhibit also applies to the evaluation of 
manufactured farm service buildings in paragraph XI, below. For the 
purpose of this exhibit, County Supervisor and County Office also mean 
District Director and District Office, respectively.
    I. Applicable Standards and Manuals.
    A. The HUD Handbook 4950.1, Technical Suitability of Products 
Program Technical and Processing Procedures, must be followed by housing 
manufacturers to obtain acceptance of their products. Acceptance 
documents issued by HUD include: Structural Engineering Bulletins (SEB) 
on a national basis, Area Letters of Acceptance (ALA) which when 
accepted by all Area HUD Offices in a HUD region will, in essence, 
become Regional Letters of Acceptance (RLA), Truss Connector Bulletins 
(TCB): and, Mechanical Engineering Bulletins (MEB). These

[[Page 124]]

documents as well as the Use of Material Bulletins (UM) and Materials 
Release Bulletins (MR) are addendums to the HUD Minimum Property 
Standards (MPS), Under handbook guidelines, HUD also examines state 
agency regulations concerning design, construction and labeling of 
modular/panelized housing units and designates those states having 
procedures acceptable for use under HUD programs. Modular/panelized 
housing produced in these states is called Category III and is 
considered technically suitable for use without further structural 
analysis.
    B. All State FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Offices should maintain a close working relationship with each HUD 
office in their jurisdiction to assure coordination. Any deviations in 
structure, materials or design from HUD acceptance documents must comply 
with one of the other applicable development standards.
    II. Modular Housing Units that Require Factory Inspections.
    Only those types which cannot be completely inspected on site are 
required to obtain acceptance from HUD. Those that receive acceptance 
will be periodically factory inspected by HUD or HUD's designated 
agency, usually about every 6 months.
    III. Panelized Housing Units that Do Not Require Factory 
Inspections.
    A. Housing completely assembled on the building site does not 
require HUD acceptance. This includes housing that is manufactured but 
is assembled on the site such as: Precut pieces, log wall houses, 
trussed roof rafters or floor trusses; open panel walls, and other types 
that can be completely inspected on site.
    B. Housing that is assembled in local materials dealers' yards for 
moving to local sites and to be purchased by an FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 applicant, will be inspected during 
construction in the yard by the local FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 County representative.These units must be constructed 
according to the applicable development standard and not transported out 
of the local FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
County Office jurisdiction. The inspection must be recorded on Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1924-12, ``Inspection 
Report.''
    IV. Manufacturer's Actions Required for Submissions to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 are listed in attachment 1 to 
this exhibit B.
    V. State FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Office Actions when Manufacturing Facilities are in its Jurisdiction. 
The State Office, upon receipt of manufacturer's submission, must:
    A. Determine that the unit structural system has been accepted by 
HUD as appropriate under HUD Handbook 4950.1 requirements.
    B. Review the thermal characteristics and approach of the 
calculations to determine actions to be taken in compliance with 
paragraph IV C of exhibit D of this subpart.
    C. Review the proposal for compliance with Sec. 1924.5(d)(1) of this 
subpart.
    D. Determine that the prerequisites for consideration of acceptance 
by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 are met. The 
prerequisites include all of the following:
    1. A current acceptance document from HUD (SEB, RLA, ALA), except 
for Category III housing (modular/panelized housing that does not have 
to have a Structural Engineering Bulletin as designated by HUD). In 
Category III states, the state government requirements for manufactured 
housing must be followed.
    2. A current HUD Factory Inspection Report, Form No. 2051m, or in 
the case of Category III housing, a copy of the inspection report from 
the state government or accepted third party performing the factory 
inspection. Each report must be made by HUD or a HUD authorized agency, 
and must be no older than 6 months.
    3. A letter from the manufacturer requesting a review for 
acceptance. Enclosed with the letter shall be all the information listed 
in attachment 1 to this exhibit B.
    E. Issue acceptance letters to the manufacturer stating the 
conditions of acceptance in the format of attachment 2 to this exhibit 
B. The letter shall have an attachment listing all models accepted in 
the format of attachment 3 to this exhibit B. A copy of the acceptance 
letter and list of models shall be sent to each County Office in the 
state and, when requested by the manufacturer, to each other FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 State Office in which the 
product is to be marketed.
    F. After initial review of a submission, maintain a master file of 
accepted manufacturers and models and review the file twice yearly to 
determine the currency of the factory inspection reports and HUD or 
state government acceptance documents.
    G. Notify manufacturers of overdue factory inspection reports, for 
acceptance of documents review and updating, using the format of 
attachment 4 to this exhibit B. Accompanying the notification will be a 
temporary acceptance sheet (Attachment 3 to this exhibit B) indicating 
to the manufacturer that the company models have temporary acceptance 
for 60 days. If the manufacturer provides evidence that a review is 
being processed by HUD, a maximum of an additional 90 days may be 
granted. Otherwise, the acceptance shall terminate on the last extension 
date and it will be necessary for the manufacturer to resubmit as if for 
initial acceptance.

[[Page 125]]

    H. Distribute a list of added models, deleted models, or notice of 
deletion of any manufacturer's product to the County Offices and other 
State FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Offices as 
necessary.
    I. Issue an initial supply of Manufacturer's and Builder's 
Certification forms (Attachment 5 to this exhibit B) to each existing 
and newly accepted manufacturer. Manufacturers are to duplicate this 
form as necessary in their market areas.
    J. Resolve any problems with the manufacturer, as reported by the 
County Office. Action may include coordination, FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 plant inspections or cancellation of 
acceptance letters when problems persist.
    VI. County Office Actions:
    A. When an application is received involving any of the 
manufacturer's products on the accepted list, the County Office FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 authorized personnel will:
    1. Review the drawings and description of materials described in 
paragraphs A and B of attachment 1 to this exhibit B. The floor plans 
and elevations must be identifiable with the model listed in the 
accepted list issued by the State Office.
    2. Require the builder/dealer or manufacturer to provide any 
drawings necessary to adapt the house to the site conditions where the 
house will be located.
    3. Require site plan drawing such as those illustrated in 
attachments 1 and 2 to exhibit C of this subpart (available in any FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    4. Inspect and identify the model delivered against the 
manufacturer's certification and the accepted drawings and description 
of materials before the unit has been set on the foundation.
    5. Require the builder/dealer to certify that the work for which the 
builder/dealer is responsible has been erected in compliance with the 
applicable development standard. This certification will be completed on 
a copy of attachment 5 to this exhibit B, and filed in County Office 
case file.
    6. Observe any noncompliance with the applicable development 
standard or with paragraphs IV and V of this exhibit B. In this respect:
    a. Minor noncompliance will be resolved by the manufacturer through 
the builder/dealer. In cases where there is no builder/dealer, the 
County Office may resolve such issues with the manufacturer directly.
    b. Noncompliance that cannot be resolved at the County Office level 
will be reported to the State Office.
    7. Inspect manufactured housing according to Sec. 1924.8(d) of this 
subpart.
    8. Be aware that the accepted list may include many models from 
which loan applicants may choose. No changes from accepted model designs 
are permitted. The model selected by an applicant should be appropriate 
to the needs of that particular family in accordance with subpart A of 
part 1944 of this chapter.
    VII. Noncompliance Issues.
    A. When minor issues are noted, the County Office will attempt to 
resolve them as described above. If they cannot be resolved locally, 
they will be referred to the State Office. When any issues cannot be 
resolved at State Office level, the National Office Program Support 
Staff (PSS) will be contacted for guidance.
    B. The National Office PSS coordinating with HUD, will take the 
appropriate actions to resolve the issues reported.
    C. Manufacturers and builder/dealers must be aware that if the FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 inspector finds any of 
the following conditions, the inspector may refuse to accept the 
construction until corrections have been made:
    1. Evidence of noncompliance with any option of the method described 
in the HUD--SEB, RLA, or ALA.
    2. Faulty shop fabrication, including surface defects.
    3. Damage to shop fabricated items or materials due to 
transportation, improper storage, handling or assembly operation.
    4. Unsatisfactory field or site workmanship.
    VIII. Actions by Other State Offices. When a State Office receives a 
copy of the accepted list from the State Office in which a manufacturing 
plant is located, it will:
    A. Maintain a file, by manufacturer, of each accepted list of 
models.
    B. Provide copies of the accepted list of models to each County 
Office in the State.
    C. Request a copy of the drawings, description of materials, and 
thermal calculations to determine compliance with the thermal 
requirements for the county in which the house is to be located 
according to exhibit D of this subpart.
    D. Check to see that County Offices within the state will act as 
prescribed in paragraph VI of this exhibit B.
    E. When two or more State Offices have different interpretations of 
the acceptability of a particular model, there must be an agreement 
between the states so that they will have the same requirements. If the 
states cannot agree, the National Office PSS will be consulted for 
guidance.
    IX. Subsequent Review.
    FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will make 
periodic reviews of houses, both site-built and houses manufactured 
offsite, to determine acceptability of the finished product. If, in the 
judgment of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, 
the product has failed to perform satisfactorily, acceptance may be

[[Page 126]]

withdrawn. The State Director will notify the manufacturer and/or the 
builder/dealer of the reasons for the withdrawal no later than the time 
of withdrawal. Negotiations for corrections will be carried out by the 
County Office with the assistance of the State Office or National 
Office, as necessary.
    X. Materials and Products Acceptance--Material Release Bulletins, 
Use of Materials Bulletins, Manufacturer's Instructions.
    A. The Materials Release (MR) and Use of Materials Bulletins (UM) 
provide for the national acceptance of specific nonstandard materials 
and products not covered in the current HUD MPS.
    B. When contractors or builders intend to use products or materials 
not listed as approved in the MPS, the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 personnel reviewing or concerned with the 
approval of construction in which the product is to be used, will 
require the contractor or builder to furnish a Materials Release 
Bulletin or Use of Materials Bulletin on the materials or products. If 
the product has been accepted, the supplier should be able to obtain the 
bulletin for the contractor or builder from the manufacturer. These 
bulletins describe the products or materials limitations to use, method 
of installing or applying, approved type of fasteners, if used, etc. and 
will provide the contractor with instructions as to proper installation 
or application.
    C. When FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
personnel are unfamiliar with any materials or products which have been 
accepted in the MPS, they will request the contractor or builder to 
furnish the manufacturer's instructions to assure that the materials or 
products are properly installed or applied. Any questions on any product 
that cannot be resolved in the County Office should be referred to the 
State Office. When the question cannot be resolved at the State Office 
level, the National Office PSS should be consulted for guidance.
    XI. Manufactured Farm Service Buildings.
    A. When a loan application is received that involves a manufactured 
building or special equipment that cannot be completely inspected on the 
site, the local State Land Grant University recommendations should be 
requested.
    B. When the County Office questions the advisability of making a 
loan on a manufactured building, the State Office should also be 
consulted.
    C. The State Office should review and make recommendations to the 
County Office. If doubt still exists, the National Office PSS should be 
consulted for guidance.

   Exhibit D to Subpart A--Thermal Performance Construction Standards

                               I. Purpose

    This exhibit prescribes thermal performance construction standards 
to be used in all housing loan and grant programs. These requirements 
shall supersede the thermal performance requirements in any of the 
development standards in Sec. 1924.4(h) of this subpart.

                               II. Policy

    All loan or grant applications involving new construction (except 
for new Single Family Housing (SFH)) and all applications for 
conditional commitments (except for new SFH) shall have drawings and 
specifications prepared to comply with paragraphs IV A or C and IV D of 
this exhibit. All new SFH construction shall have drawing and 
specifications prepared to comply with paragraph IV F of this exhibit. 
All existing dwellings to be acquired with FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 loan funds shall be considered in accordance 
with paragraph IV B or C of this exhibit.

                            III. Definitions

    A. British thermal unit (Btu) means the quantity of heat required to 
raise the temperature of one pound (.4535 Kg.) of water by one degree 
Fahrenheit (F). For example, one Btu is the amount of heat needed to 
raise the temperature of one pound of water from 59 degrees F to 60 
degrees F.
    B. Glazing is the material set into a sash or door when used as a 
natural light source and/or for occupant's views of the outdoors.
    C. ``R'' value, thermal resistence, is a unit of measure of the 
ability to resist heat flow. The higher the R value, the higher the 
insulating ability.
    D. ``U'' value is the overall coefficient of heat transmission and 
is the combined thermal value of all the materials in a building 
section. U is the reciprocal of R. Thus U=1/R or R=1/U or 1/C where C is 
the thermal conductance and is the unit of measure of the rate of heat 
flow for the actual thickness of a material one square foot in area at a 
temperature of one degree Fahrenheit. The lower the U value, the higher 
the insulating ability.
    E. Winter degree-day is a unit based on temperature difference and 
time. For any one day, when the mean temperature is less than 65 degrees 
F (18.3 degrees Celsius), there are as many degree-days as the number of 
degrees difference between the mean temperature for the day and 65 
degrees F. The daily mean temperature is computed as half the total of 
the daily maximum and daily minimum temperatures.
    F. CABO Model Energy Code, 1992 Edition (MEC-92)--This code sets 
forth the minimum energy/thermal requirements for the design of new 
buildings and structures or portions thereof and additions to existing 
buildings. The MEC is maintained by the Council of American Building 
Officials (CABO).

                        IV. Minimum Requirements

    A. All multifamily dwellings to be constructed with FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan and/or grant funds and 
all repair, remodeling, or renovation work performed on single family 
and multifamily dwellings with FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 loan and/or grant funds shall be in conformance with the 
following, except as provided in paragraphs IV C 3 and IV D of this 
exhibit:

Note.--U values are not adjusted for framing. Values calculated for components may be rounded. For example, a
  total R Value of 18.88 converts to a U value of .0529 rounded to .05.
\1\ Winter degree-days may be obtained from the ASHRAE Handbook; the ``NAHB Insulation Manual for Homes/
  Apartments''; local utilities; and the National Climatic Center, Federal Building, Asheville, NC. Manuals are
  available from NAHB RF, Rockville, MD 20850, or NMWIA, 382 Springfield Avenue, Summit, NJ 07901. Other sources
  of degree day data may be used if available from a recognized authority.
\2\ Insulation must be continuous (i.e. no gaps) above all ceiling joists. In pitched roof construction,
  compression of insulation at the outside building walls is permitted to allow a 1" ventilation space under the
  roof sheathing. For any loose fill insulation, a baffle must be provided. Raised trusses are not required.
\3\ For floors of heated spaces over unheated basements, unheated garages or unheated crawl spaces, the U value
  of floor section shall not exceed the value shown. A basement, crawl space, or garage shall be considered
  unheated unless it is provided with a positive heat supply to maintain a minimum temperature of 50 degrees F.
  Positive heat supply is defined by ASHRAE as ``heat supplied to a space by design or by heat losses occurring
  from energy-consuming systems or components associated with that space.''
 AWhere the walls of an unheated basement or crawl space are insulated in lieu of floor insulation, the total
  heat loss attributed to the floor from the heated area shall not exceed the heat loss calculated for floors
  with required insulation.
 AInsulation may be omitted from floors over heated basement areas or heated crawl spaces if foundation walls
  are insulated. The U value of foundation wall sections shall not exceed the value shown. This requirement
  shall include all foundation wall area, including header joist (band joist), to a point 50 percent of the
  distance from a finish grade to the basement floor level. Equivalent Uo configurations are acceptable.

acceptance of manufactured housing proposed under paragraph C 2 of this 
exhibit may be approved by the State Director. All submissions of 
proposed options to the State Director or Administrator shall contain 
complete descriptions of materials, engineering data, test data (when U 
values claimed are lower than the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals), and 
calculations to document the validity of the proposal. All data and 
calculations will be based upon the current edition of the ASHRAE 
Handbook of Fundamentals or other universally accepted data sources.

    1. Overall ``U'' values for enveloped components. The following 
requirements shall be used in determining acceptable options to the 
requirements of paragraphs IV A and IV B of this exhibit.
    a. Uo (gross wall)--Total exterior wall area (opaque wall and window 
and door) shall have a combined thermal transmittance value (Uo value) 
not to exceed the values shown in attachment 1 to this exhibit D 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office). Equation 1 in attachment 1 shall be used to determine 
acceptable combinations to meet the requirements.
    b. Uo (gross ceiling)--Total ceiling area (opaque ceiling and 
skylights) shall have a combined thermal transmittance value (Uo value) 
not to exceed the values shown in attachment 2 to this exhibit D

be used in determining acceptable options to the requirements of 
paragraphs IV A and B of this exhibit.
    a. The methodology must be cost effective to the energy user, and 
must not adversely affect the structural capacity, durability or safety 
aspects of the structure.
    b. All data and calculations must show valid performance comparisons 
between the proposed option and a structure comparable in size, 
configuration, orientation and occupant usage designed in accordance 
with paragraphs IV A or B. Structures may be considered for FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan consideration which can 
be shown by accepted engineering practice to have energy consumption 
equal to or less than those which would be attained in a representative 
structure utilizing the requirements of paragraphs IV A or B.
    3. Special consideration for seasonally occupied farm labor housing. 
The following sets forth the minimum acceptable options to the 
requirements of paragraphs IV A or B of this exhibit for seasonally 
occupied housing serving as security for farm labor housing loans and 
grants.
    a. When the period of occupancy does not encounter 500 or more 
heating degree-days (HDD) as determined by an average of the previous 10 
years based upon local climatological data published by the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Environmental Data Service, the 
standards of paragraphs IV A or B will not apply.
    b. When the period of use exceeds 500 HDD, the 10-year average value 
for the period of occupancy shall be used to determine the degree to 
which the thermal insulation requirements of paragraphs IV A or B shall 
apply.
    c. If mechanical cooling is provided and the period of occupancy 
encounters more than 700 cooling degree-days (CDD), as determined by an 
average of the previous 8 years based upon local climatological data 
published by the same source cited in paragraph IV C3a above, the 
thermal insulation requirements for 1,000 and less degree-days as stated 
in paragraph IV A or B shall apply.
    D. Energy efficient construction practices. This section prescribes 
those items of design and quality control which are necessary to 
guarantee the energy efficiency of homes built according to the 
standards of this exhibit. Also included are recommendations for extra 
energy efficiency in dwellings. This section does not apply to new SFH 
construction.

performed in such a manner as to provide a building envelope free of 
excessive infiltration.
    (i) Caulking and sealants. Exterior joints around windows and door 
frames, between wall cavities and window or door frames, between wall 
and foundation, between wall and roof, between wall panels, at 
penetrations of utility services through walls, floors and roofs, and 
all other openings in the exterior envelope shall be caulked, gasketed, 
weatherstripped, or otherwise sealed. Caulking shall be silicone rubber 
base or butyl rubber base, conforming to Federal Specifications TT-S-
1543 and TT-S-1657 respectively, or materials demonstrating equivalent 
performance in resilience and durability.
    (ii) Windows shall comply with ANSI 134.1, NWMA 15-2; the air 
infiltration rate shall not exceed 0.5 ft 3/min per ft. of sash crack.
    (iii) Sliding glass doors shall comply with ANSI 134.2, NWM 15-3; 
the air infiltration rate shall not exceed .5 ft 3/min per square ft. of 
door area.
    (iv) All insulation placed in open cavity walls shall be installed 
so that all space behind electrical switches and receptacles, plumbing, 
ductwork and other obstructions in the cavity are insulated as 
completely as possible. Insulation shall be omitted on the side facing 
the conditioned area; however, the vapor barrier in walls must not be 
cut or destroyed.
    b. Recommendations: (i) Wrap outside corners of wall sheathing with 
15 lb. asphalt impregnated building felt before siding application.
    (ii) Utilize vestibules for entry doors, especially those facing 
into the direction of winter wind.
    (iii) Install plumbing, mechanical and electrical components in 
interior partitions as much as possible. All water piping should be 
insulated from freezing temperatures.
    2. Heating and/or Cooling Equipment. a. Requirements: All mechanical 
equipment for heating and/or cooling habitable space shall be designed 
to provide economy of operations.
    (i) All space heating equipment (including fireplaces) requiring 
combustion air shall be sealed combustion types, or be located in a 
nonconditioned area (such as unheated basements) or adequate combustion 
air must be provided from outside the conditioned space.
    (ii) All ductwork shall be designed and installed to minimize 
leakage. All metal to metal connections shall be mechanically joined and 
taped.
    b. Recommendations: (i) Whenever possible, locate ductwork inside of 
conditioned areas in dropped ceilings, interior partitions or other 
similar areas.
    (ii) Locate outside cooling units in areas not subject to direct 
sunlight or heat buildup.
    3. Vapor Barrier. a. Requirements: Adequate vapor barriers must be 
provided adjacent to the interior finish material of the wall or other 
closed envelope components

[[Page 136]]

which do not have ventilation space on the non-conditioned side of the 
insulation.
    (i) A vapor barrier at the inside of the wall or other closed 
envelope component must have a permeability (perm) rating less than that 
of any other material in the component and in no case have a perm rating 
greater than one. All vapor barriers must be sealed around all openings 
in the interior surface. Vapor barriers are not required in ceilings and 
floors. Continuous vapor barriers on ceilings, walls, and floors require 
adequate moisture vapor control in the conditioned space.
    (ii) All vapor producing or exhaust equipment shall be ducted to the 
outside and equipped with dampers. This equipment includes rangehoods, 
bathroom exhaust fans and clothes dryers. If a dwelling design proposes 
the use of windows to satisfy the kitchen and/or bathroom ventilation 
requirements of the development standards, the incorporation of 
dehumidification equipment should be considered in accordance with 
paragraph IV D 3 b. Exhaust of any equipment shall not terminate in an 
attic or crawl space.
    b. Recommendation: Forced air heating/cooling systems should include 
humidification/dehumidification systems where conditions indicate.
    E. [Reserved]
    F. New SFH construction. New SFH construction shall meet the 
requirements of CABO Model Energy Code, 1992 Edition (MEC-92).
    G. New manufactured housing.
    The Uo Value Zone indicated on the ``Heating Certificate'' for 
comfort heating shall be equal to or greater than the HUD Zone listed in 
the following table:
      

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             FMHCSS (HUD
          RHS climate zones (winter degree days)              code) Uo
                                                             value zones
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0-1000....................................................            1
1001-2500.................................................            2
2501-4500.................................................            2
4501-6000.................................................            3
> 6000....................................................            3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Example: If a manufactured home is to be located in a geographic 
area having between 2501 and 4500 RHS winter degree days, the Agency 
will accept a Uo value Zone 2 unit or Zone 3 unit constructed to the HUD 
FMHCSS.
    If a central air conditioning system is provided by the home 
manufacturer, a ``Comfort Cooling Certificate'' must be permanently 
affixed to an interior surface of the unit that is readily visible. This 
certificate may be combined with the heating certificate on the data 
plate.
    V. General Design Recommendations:
    A. Orient homes with greatest glass area facing south with adequate 
overhangs to control solar gain during non-heating periods. Examples of 
proper roof overhangs are given in attachment 3 to this exhibit D 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office).
    B. Arrange plantings with evergreen wind buffers on north side and 
deciduous trees on south.
    C. Whenever possible, orient entry door away from winter winds.
    D. Design house with simple shape to minimize exterior wall area.
    E. Minimize glass areas within constraints of required light and 
ventilation, applicable safety codes and other appropriate 
consideration.
    F. Minimize the amount of paved surface adjacent to the structure 
where heat gain is not desirable.
    VI. State Supplements: State supplements or policies will not be 
issued or adopted to either supplement or set requirements different 
from those of this exhibit without the prior written approval of the 
National Office.

    This exhibit prescribes the methods to be used to comply with the 
requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, Public 
Law 91-695, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4801 et seq.) and the amendment to 
section 501 (3) of Public Law 91-695 (42 U.S.C. 4841 (3)) as amended by 
the National Consumer Health Information and Health Promotion Act of 
1976, Public Law 94-317.

                               II. Policy

    The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 shall not permit the use of lead-based paint on 
applicable surfaces of any housing or buildings purchased, repaired, or 
rehabilitated for human habitation with financial assistance provided by 
this agency. Paints used on applicable surfaces shall not contain more 
than 0.06 percent lead by weight calculated as lead metal in the total 
nonvolatile content of liquid paints or in the dried film of paint 
already applied.

                            III. Definitions

    A. Housing and buildings mean any house, apartment, or structure 
intended for human habitation. This includes any institutional structure 
where persons reside, such as an orphanage, boarding school, dormitory, 
day care center or extended care facility, college housing, domestic or 
migratory labor housing, hospitals, group practice facilities, community 
facilities, and business or industrial facilities.
    B. Applicable surfaces means all interior surfaces, whether

accessible to children under 7 years of age, such as stairs, decks, 
porches, railings, windows, and doors.
    C. Lead-based paint means any paint containing more than .5 of 1 
percentum lead by weight, or with respect to paint manufactured after 
June 22, 1977, lead-based paint containing more than six one-hundredths 
of 1 percentum lead by weight.

                            IV. Requirements

    A. All new housing and buildings shall comply with paragraph II of 
this exhibit H.
    B. For all existing housing and buildings built after 1950, on which 
a loan is closed after July 19, 1978, FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 requires that the applicant, borrower or tenant be 
notified of the potential hazard of lead-based paints, of the symptoms 
and treatment of lead poisoning, and of the importance and availability 
of maintenance and removal techniques for eliminating such hazards. This 
will be accomplished by providing each

[[Page 140]]

applicant, borrower and/or tenant with a copy of attachment 1 to this 
exhibit H, ``Lead-based Paint Hazards, Symptoms, Treatment and 
Techniques for Eliminating Hazards,'' available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 County Office. Copies of 
attachment 1 may be obtained by the County Supervisor from the Finance 
Office, 1520 Market Street, St. Louis, MO 63103.
    C. For all existing housing or buildings built before 1950 on which 
a loan is closed after July 19, 1978, FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 requires that the applicant, borrower and/or tenant 
be notified as in paragraph IV B and a copy of attachment 2 to this 
exhibit H, ``Caution Note on Lead-Based Paint Hazard,'' available in any 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 County Office, 
shall be delivered to the hands of the applicant, borrowers and/or 
tenant.
    D. For all property transfers and inventory property sales, 
attachments 1 and 2 to this Exhibit H (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) shall be handed to the 
purchaser by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
representative.
    E. All inventory housing or buildings built before 1950 to be 
repaired, renovated, or rehabilitated shall have tests for lead content, 
and where found to be hazardous, shall have any interior lead-based 
paint removed entirely. Loose or cracked surfaces shall be cleaned down 
to the base surface before repainting with a paint containing not more 
than six one-hundredths of 1 percentum lead by weight in the total 
nonvolatile content of the paint or the equivalent measure of lead in 
the dried film of paint already applied or both. Contracting officers 
shall include the following provision prohibiting the use of lead-based 
paint in all contracts and subcontracts for construction or 
rehabilitation of housing or buildings:

                      Lead-Based Paint Prohibition

weight (calculated as lead metal) in the total nonvolatile content of 
the paint, or the equivalent measure of lead in the dried film of paint 
already applied, or both, or with respect to paint manufactured after 
June 22, 1977, no lead-based paint containing more than .06 of 1 
percentum lead by weight (calculated as lead metal) in the total 
nonvolatile content of the paint, or the equivalent measure of lead in 
the dried film of paint already applied, or both, shall be used in the 
construction or rehabilitation of residential structures under this 
contract or any subsequent subcontractors.
    Authority: This amendment is made under provisions of 5 U.S.C. 301, 
40 U.S.C. 486 (c).
    Done at ______, ________ this ____ day of ________, 19__.

FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Representative

                               V. Summary

    Section 401 of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act as 
amended by the National Consumer Health Information and Health Promotion 
Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-317, provides a requirement that each federal 
agency issue regulations and to take such other steps necessary to 
prohibit the use of lead-based paint on all applicable surfaces in 
Federal and Federally-assisted construction or rehabilitation of 
residential structures. The Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, 
Pub. L. 91-695, January 13, 1971, provides for grants to units of 
general local government in any state for the purpose of detecting and 
treating incidents of lead-based paint poisoning. Title II of this Act 
also provides for grants to the same units to identify those areas of 
risk including testing to detect the presence of lead-based paint on 
surfaces of residential housing.

   Exhibit I to Subpart A--Guidelines for Seasonal Farm Labor Housing

                               Section 100

    General--This exhibit sets forth the guidelines and minimum 
standards for planning and construction of new Labor Housing (LH) that 
will be occupied on a seasonal basis. Rehabilitation LH projects will be 
in substantial conformance with these guidelines and standards. A 
``seasonal basis'' is defined as 6 months or less per year. Seasonal 
housing for the farmworker need not be convertible to year-round 
occupancy; however, the living units shall be designed for the intended 
type of tenant, the time of occupancy, the location, the specific site, 
and the planned method of operation. It is important that the design of 
the LH site and buildings will help to create a pleasing lifestyle which 
will promote human dignity and pride among its tenants.

                               Section 200

    Codes and Regulations--Compliance is required with National, state 
and local codes or regulations affecting design, construction, 
mechanical, electrical, fire prevention, sanitation, and site 
improvement.

                               Section 300

                                Planning

    300-1  Complete architectural/engineering services in accordance 
with this subpart will be required if an LH grant is involved or the LH 
loan will involve more than four individual family units, or any number 
of group

[[Page 141]]

living units, or dormitory units accommodating 20 or more persons.
    300-2  Buildings and site design shall provide for a safe, secure, 
economical, healthful, and attractive living facility and environment 
suited to the needs of the domestic farm laborer and his/her family.
    300-3  At least 5 percent of the individual family units in a 
project, or one unit, whichever is greater, and all common use 
facilities will be accessible to or adaptable for physically handicapped 
persons. This requirement may be modified if a recipient/borrower shows, 
through a market survey acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354, that a different percentage of accessible or 
adapatable units is more appropriate for a particular project and its 
service area.

                               Site Design

    301-1  General--The site design shall be arranged to utilize and 
preserve the favorable features and characteristics of the property and 
to avoid or minimize the potential harmful effect of unfavorable 
features. Particular attention is directed to Sec. 1944.164 (l), (m) and 
(n) of subpart D of part 1944 of this chapter with reference to 
compliance with subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter. Some of the

Part C--Drawings, Specifications, Contract Documents and Other 
          Documentation
Part D--Inspection of Development Work

                          Part A--Introduction

    I. Purpose and Scope. This exhibit describes and identifies 
acceptable site development, installation and set-up practices and 
concepts for manufactured homes. It is intended for FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 field personnel, builders, 
developers, sponsors, and others participating in FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 housing programs.
    This exhibit applies to all manufactured homes (except those 
referenced in exhibit B of this subpart) on scattered sites or in rental 
projects and subdivisions and covers the requirements for design and 
construction of manufactured home communities. FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 may approve alternatives or substitutes 
if it finds the proposed design satisfactory for the proposed use, and 
if the materials, installation, device, arrangement, or method of work 
is at least equivalent to that prescribed in this exhibit considering 
quality, strength, effectiveness, durability, safety and protection of 
life and health.
    FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will require 
satisfactory evidence to be submitted to substantiate claims made 
regarding the use of any proposed alternative.
    II. Background. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 has authority to make (1) section 502 Rural Housing (RH) loans with 
respect to manufactured homes and lots, and (2) section 515 Rural Rental 
Housing (RRH) loans with respect to manufactured home rental projects.
    The manufactured home must be constructed in conformance with the 
Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard (FMHCSS) and 
be permanently attached to a site-built permanent foundation which meets 
or exceeds the Minimum Property Standards (MPS) for One- and Two-

[[Page 144]]

Family Dwellings or Model Building Codes acceptable to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354. The manufactured home must be 
permanently attached to that foundation by anchoring devices adequate to 
resist all loads identified in the MPS. This includes resistance to 
ground movements, seismic shaking, potential shearing, overturning and 
uplift loads caused by wind. Note that anchoring straps or cables 
affixed to ground anchors other than footings will not meet these 
requirements.
    Subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter applies on scattered sites, 
in subdivisions and rental projects to the development, installation and 
set-up of manufactured homes. To determine the level of environmental 
analysis required for a particular application, each manufactured home 
or lot involved shall be considered as equivalent to one housing unit or 
lot as these terms are used in Secs. 1940.310-1940.312 as well as in any 
other sections of subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter. The 
implementation of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
environmental policies and the consideration of important land use 
impacts are of particular relevance in the review of proposed 
manufactured home sites and in achieving the two purposes highlighted 
below. Because the development, installation and set-up of manufactured 
home communities, including scattered sites, rental projects, and 
subdivisions, differ in some requirements from conventional site and 
subdivision development, two of the purposes of this exhibit are to:
    A. Encourage economical and orderly development of such communities 
and nearby areas, and
    B. Promote the safety and health of residents of such communities.
    Therefore, this exhibit identifies those required standards and 
regulations and suggested guidelines for eliminating and preventing 
health and safety hazards and promoting the economical and orderly 
development and utilization of land for planning and development of 
manufactured home communities. The exhibit also provides the 
requirements for meeting the following:
    A. Resistance to Wind. Foundations and anchorages shall be designed 
to resist wind forces specified in American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) A-58.1-1982 for the geographic area in which the manufactured 
home will be sited;
    B. Proper Installation. The manufacturer's installation instructions 
provided with each manufactured home shall contain instructions for at 
least one site-built foundation with interior and/or perimeter supports. 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 field office 
personnel shall review to determine its adequacy as security for an FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan only, the 
foundation design concept for compliance with this exhibit, the FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354/MPS and any Model Building 
Code acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
in that particular geographic area; and
    C. Proper Foundation Design. Manufactured homes shall be installed 
on a foundation system which is designed and constructed to sustain, 
within allowable stress and settlement limitations, all applicable 
loads. Any foundation and anchorage system or method of construction to 
be used should be analyzed in accordance with well-established 
principles of mechanics and structural engineering.
    III. Definitions. For the purpose of this exhibit the following 
definitions apply:
    Accessory Building or Structure.
    A subordinate building or structure which is an addition to or 
supplements the facilities provided by a manufactured home.
    Anchoring Systems. An approved system for securing the manufactured 
home to the ground or foundation system that will, when properly 
designed and installed, resist overturning and lateral movement of the 
home from wind forces.
    Contiguous. Sharing a boundary, adjoining or adjacent. A lot or 
subdivision is considered to be contiguous to other lots or subdivisions 
if it is adjoining, touching or adjacent.
    Federal manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards 
(FMHCSS). A 1976 federal standard, commonly known as the HUD Standard, 
for the construction, design and performance of a manufactured home 
which meets the needs of the public including the need for quality, 
durability and safety. Units conforming to the FMHCSS are certified by 
an affixed label that reads as follows:

    AS EVIDENCED BY THIS LABEL NO. ________ THE MANUFACTURER CERTIFIES 
TO THE BEST OF THE MANUFACTURER'S KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF THAT THIS 
MANUFACTURED HOME HAS BEEN INSPECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS 
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND IS CONSTRUCTED IN 
CONFORMANCE WITH THE FEDERAL MANUFACTURED HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY 
STANDARDS IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE. SEE DATA PLATE.

    Manufactured Home. A structure which is built to the Federal 
Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards and FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354's thermal requirements. It is

(consisting of a combination of footings, piers, caps and shims and 
anchoring devices or required structural connections) which is designed 
and constructed to support the unit and sustain, within allowable stress 
and settlement limitations, all applicable loads specified in ANSI 
A58.1-1982. All loads shall be transferred from the manufactured home to 
the earth at a depth below the established frost line without exceeding 
the safe bearing capacity of the supporting soil.
    Set-Up. The work performed and operations involved in the placement 
of a manufactured home on a foundation system, to include installation 
of accessories or appurtenances and anchoring devices, and when local 
regulations permit, connection of utilities, but excluding preparation 
of the site.
    IV. Compliance with Local Regulations. These requirements do not 
replace site development standards established by local law, ordinances, 
or regulations. Whenever such local standards contain more stringent 
provisions than any of the site development, installation and set-up 
minimums of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the 
more stringent standards shall govern.

                Part B--Construction and Land Development

    I. General Acceptability Criteria. The following criteria apply to 
development on scattered sites, in subdivisions and in rental project 
communities.

[[Page 146]]

    A. A manufactured home development including a site, rental project 
or subdivision shall be located on property designated for that use, 
where designations exist, by the local jurisdiction.
    B. Conditions of soil, ground water level, drainage, flooding and 
topography shall not create hazards to the property and health or safety 
of the residents.
    C. The finished grade elevation beneath the manufactured home or the 
first flood elevation of the habitable space, whichever is lower, shall 
be above the 100-year return frequency flood elevation. This requirement 
applies wherever manufactured homes may be installed, not just in 
locations designated by the National Flood Insurance Program as areas of 
special flood hazards. The use of fill to accomplish this is a last 
resort. However, as stated in Sec. 1940.304 of subpart G of part 1940 of 
this chapter, it is FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354's policy not to approve or fund any proposal in a 100-year 
floodplain area unless there is no practicable alternative to such a 
floodplain location.
    D. Essential service such as employment centers, shopping, schools, 
recreation areas, police and fire protection, and garbage and trash 
removal shall be convenient to the development and any site, community, 
or subdivision must meet the environmental and location requirements 
contained in subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter.
    E. Manufactured home sites, rental projects and subdivisions shall 
not be subject to any adverse influences of adjacent land uses. An 
adverse influence is considered as one that is out of the acceptable 
level or range of a recognizable standard or where no standard exists is 
considered a nuisance irrespective of a site being zoned for 
manufactured home use. Health, safety and aesthetic consequences of 
location shall be carefully assessed by inspection of the site prior to 
selection of development. Undesirable land uses sush as deteriorated 
residential or commercial areas and noxious industrial properties shall 
be avoided to ensure compatibility. Other undesirable elements such as 
heavily traveled highways, airport runways, railroad, or fire hazards 
and other areas subject to recognizably intolerable noise levels shall 
be avoided.
    F. The requirements for streets shall be those found in subpart C of 
part 1924 of this chapter.
    G. The site design and development shall be in accordance with sound 
engineering and architectural practices and shall provide for all 
utilities in a manner which allows adequate, economic, safe, energy 
efficient and dependable systems with sufficient easements for their 
required installation and maintenance.
    H. Utilities for each manufactured home site, rental housing project 
or subdivision shall be designed and installed in accordance with 
subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter; and the State health authority 
having jurisdiction, and all local laws and regulations requiring 
approval prior to construction.
    I. Exhibit C, section V of this subpart shall be complied with by 
the applicant, dealer-contractor or builder-developer for manufactured 
home projects with individual water supply and sewage disposal systems. 
This exhibit shall be used by the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 County Supervisors, District Directors, and State 
Directors in reviewing submissions.
    J. During the planning, design, and construction of the foundation 
system and/or perimeter enclosure, provisions shall be made for the 
installation and connection of on-site water, gas, electrical and sewer 
systems, which are necessary for the normal operation of the 
manufactured home. Water and sewer system hookups shall be adequately 
protected from freezing.
    II. Development on Scattered Sites and in Subdivisions.--A. General. 
Scattered sites and subdivision developments will be planned and 
constructed in accordance with specific requirements of this subpart, 
subpart C of part 1924, and subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter, and 
the applicable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354/MPS 
or Model Building Codes acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354. Manufactured homes for development in a manufactured 
home community shall:
    1. Be erected with or without a basement on a site-built permanent 
foundation that meets or exceeds applicable requirements of the FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354/MPS for One- and Two-
Family Dwellings or Model Building Codes acceptable to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354;
    2. Be permanently attached to that foundation by anchoring devices 
adequate to resist all loads identified in the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 adopted MPS (this includes resistance to 
ground movements, seismic shaking, potential shearing, overturning and 
uplift loads caused by wind, etc.);
    3. Have had the towing hitch or running gear, which includes 
tongues, axles, brakes, wheels, lights and other parts of the chassis 
that operate only during transportation removed;
    4. Have any crawl space beneath the manufactured home properly 
ventilated and enclosed by a continuous permanent perimeter enclosure. 
If it is not the supporting foundation, designed to resist all forces to 
which it may be subject without transmitting to the building 
superstructure movements or any effects caused by frost heave, soil 
settlement (consolidation), or shrinking or swelling of expansive soils; 
and be constructed of materials that conform to FmHA or its successor

[[Page 147]]

agency under Public Law 103-354 adopted MPS requirements for 
foundations;
    5. Have the manufactured home insulated to meet the energy 
conserving requirements contained in exhibit D of this subpart;
    6. Have a manufactured home site, site improvements, and all other

    2. Accessory structures shall be carefully designed and constructed 
for the convenience and comfort of the manufactured home occupant. These 
features significantly affect the visual appearance of the community and 
influence livability.
    C. Related Facilities (Rental Housing Projects). 1. This includes 
those facilities as defined in Secs. 1944.205(i) and 1944.212(f) of 
subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter.
    1. This includes those facilities as defined in Sec. 1944.212(e) of 
subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter.
    2. Related facilities built on-site must meet the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354/MPS and subpart A of part 1924 
of this chapter or other building codes approved by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    3. Workmanship shall be of a quality equal to good standard 
practice. Material shall be of such kind and quality as to assure 
reasonable durability and economy of maintenance, all commensurate with

     Part C--Drawings, Specifications, Contract Documents and Other 
                              Documentation

    I. General. Adequate site development and foundation installation 
drawings and specfications shall be provided by the applicant or dealer-
contractor to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to 
fully describe the construction and other development work. These 
documents shall be provided according to the requirements of 
Sec. 1924.5(f)(1) of this subpart. Contract documents will be prepared 
in accordance with Sec. 1924.6 and, in the case of multiple family 
housing construction and development, Sec. 1924.13 of this subpart.
    A. The documents recommended shall be used as a guide for drawings 
and specifications to be submitted in support of all types of loan and/
or grant applications involving manufactured homes. Adequate and 
accurate drawings and specifications are necessary to:
    1. Determine the acceptability of the physical environment and 
improvements,
    2. Determine compliance with the applicable standards and codes,
    3. Review cost estimates, and
    4. Provide a basis for financing, inspections, and the warranty.
    B. Detailed floor plans, drawings and specifications are not 
required for any manufactured home to be installed on a scattered site, 
in a subdivision or rental housing project. However, a schematic floor 
plan should be submitted by the applicant when applying for FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financing. The unit must have 
an affixed label as specified in paragraph XIV (c)(3) of exhibit F of 
subpart A of part 1944 indicating that the unit is constructed to the 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 thermal 
requirements for the appropriate winter degree days. This will indicate 
that the manufacturer certifies that the unit has been properly 
inspected and it meets the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354

[[Page 149]]

Thermal Performance Construction Standard.
    C. For proposed construction, the builder or dealer-contractor shall 
submit with the loan or grant application design calculations, details 
and drawings for the installation, anchorage and construction of the 
permanent foundations and perimeter enclosure to be used. Drawings and 
specifications for foundation systems will be reviewed and examined by 
either the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 County 
Supervisor, District Director, or State Architect/Engineer for 
foundation support locations, loads and connection requirements 
specified by the manufacturer as a basis for evaluating foundation 
compliance with the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354/MPS or Model Building Code, and for determining design suitability 
for soil conditions. Drawings and specifications will also be examined 
by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to determine 
compliance with all other on-site features not covered by the FMHCSS.
    D. Foundation design sections and details of all critical 
construction points systems, anchorage methods, and structural items 
shall be scaled as necessary to provide all appropriate information 1:30 
(3/8''=1'-0'') minimum.
    II. Scattered Sites. Drawings for single family manufactured housing 
shall be submitted by the applicant in addition to the requirements of 
paragraph I above and the requirements of paragraphs II A and D-7 of 
exhibit C of this subpart.
    III. Subdivisions. Subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter will be 
used in preparing and providing supporting documents.
    IV. Rental Housing Projects. Subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter 
will be used in preparing and providing supporting documents.
    V. Specifications. A. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 424-2, ``Description of Materials,'' or other acceptable and 
comparable descriptions of all materials used for site development, 
foundation installation and the permanent perimeter enclosure shall be 
submitted with the drawings by the applicant.
    B. The material identification information shall be in sufficient 
detail to fully describe the material, size and grade. Where necessary, 
additional sheets shall be attached as well as manufacturer's 
specification sheets for equipment and/or special materials.

                 Part D--Inspection of Development Work

    I. General. The following policies will govern the inspection of all 
manufactured housing development work. This includes scattered sites, 
subdivisions, rental housing projects and all accessory structures and 
related facilities unless otherwise indicated.
    II. Inspections. A. The responsibility for frequency and propose of 
inspections shall be in accordance with Sec. 1924.9(b) (1), (2) and (3) 
of this subpart. The inspection requirements of Sec. 1924.13 apply to 
the planning and conduct of construction work on all 515 housing 
developments that are more extensive in scope and more complex in nature 
than those involving an individual manufactured housing unit. The Stage 
2 inspection customary for site-built housing when the building is 
enclosed is not required for manufactured homes.
    The Stage 2 inspection for manufactured homes will be made within 
two working days after erection or placement on the foundation to 
determine compliance with accepted installation drawings and 
specifications for installation and set-up and to verify that the 
correct unit is on the site.
    Stages 2 and 3 inspections for manufactured homes may be combined 
when authorized by the State Director.
    B. The borrower will join the County Supervisor or the District 
Director in making periodic inspections as often as possible and always 
for the final inspection.
    C. The borrower should be encouraged to make enough periodic visits 
to the site to be familiar with the progress and performance of the work 
in order to protect the borrower's interest. If the borrower observes or 
otherwise becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or 
nonconformance with the contract documents, the borrower should give 
prompt written notice thereof to the dealer-contractor and a copy of the 
notice to the appropriate County Supervisor or District Director.
    D. During inspection, it will generally be infeasible to determine 
whether a manufactured unit erected on a site was properly braced and 
stiffened during transportation. Inspectors should examine these units 
to determine that there is no obvious damage or loosening of fastenings 
that may have occurred during transportation. The dealer-contractor must 
warrant these units against such damage, which should protect FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's interest.
    III. Warranty Plan Coverage. The warranty requirements for all 
development work shall be in accordance with Sec. 1924.9(d) of this 
subpart and exhibit F of subpart A of part 1944 of this chapter.

  Exhibit K to Subpart A--Classifications for Multi-Family Residential 
                           Rehabilitation Work

                               I. General

    This exhibit distinguishes between what FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public

[[Page 150]]

Law 103-354 considers maintenance and repair work, moderate 
rehabilitation and substantial rehabilitation. In all cases, the 
building or project to be rehabilitated shall be structurally sound. The 
applicant shall have a structural analysis of the existing building made 
to determine the adequacy of all structural systems for the proposed 
rehabilitation.

                             II. Definitions

    Maintenance and Repair--Work involved in the selective replacement 
and general maintenance and repair of certain materials, appliances or 
components of an existing residential building.
    Moderate Rehabilitation--All work directly involved in the 
rearrangement of interior space, the replacement of finish materials or 
components of the electrical, plumbing, heating or conveyance systems of 
an existing multi-family residential building. Work and improvements are 
considered to be more than routine maintenance and repair.
    Substantial Rehabilitation--All work directly involved in the 
rearrangement of interior space that involves alteration of load bearing 
partitions and columns; the replacement of the electrical, plumbing, 
heating or conveyance systems; and the addition to and/or major 
conversion of existing multi-family residential buildings or other 
building structures.
    Moderate rehabilitation and repair shall not be limited to building 
changes for cosmetic or convenience purposes. In all cases moderate 
rehabilitation shall involve a minimum of three (3) components of 
building rehabilitation listed as moderate. Unless combined with other 
improvements in a project that are considered to be moderate or 
substantial rehabilitation the items identified as maintenance and 
repair are considered to be cosmetic and convenience changes.
    When a rehabilitation project consists of both moderate and 
substantial rehabilitation components, those substantial rehabilitation 
components shall be in accordance with FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354's development standards and local codes and 
regulation requirements. Where the majority of project components of 
building rehabilitation are considered substantial the project shall be 
considered in the substantial rehabilitation category.
    Those site components of rehabilitation such as landscaping, 
grading, drainage, fencing, parking areas, recreation areas, water and 
waste disposal systems, etc., whether considered either maintenance and 
repair, moderate rehabilitation or substantial rehabilitation shall be 
in accordance with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354's development standards for site development work; all local codes 
and regulation requirements; and sound engineering and architectural 
practices.
    Any alteration of a structure listed or eligible for listing on the 
National Register of Historic Places may be considered either moderate 
or substantial rehabilitation; however, it shall conform first to the 
Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines 
for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and then to FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354's requirements. In cases where the 
Secretary of the Interior's standards cannot be met, rehabilitation will 
conform to the agreed upon approaches, treatments and techniques 
resulting from the consultation process between FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354, the borrower, the State Historic 
Preservation Officer and the Advisory Council of Historic Preservation.

         III. Components of Multi-Family Building Rehabilitation

    The components of multi-family building rehabilitation necessary and 
generally considered by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 to be either maintenance and repair, moderate rehabilitation or 
substantial rehabilitation include but are not limited to those listed 
in the following chart.

 Exhibit L to Subpart A--Insured 10-Year Home Warranty Plan Requirements

                               I. Purpose

    In recent years, numerous third-party home warranty plans have been 
developed offering new homeowners varying degrees of protection against 
builder default and/or major structural defects in their homes. This 
exhibit establishes the criteria and procedures by which a warranty plan 
is found acceptable for new construction of single family homes financed 
by Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354. An acceptable warranty plan will:
    A. Assure that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
borrowers receive adequate warranty coverage,
    B. In certain circumstances, eliminate the requirement for FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 personnel to make the 
first two construction inspections, and
    C. Permit a loan up to the market value of the security (less the 
unpaid principal balance and past due interest of any other liens 
against the security), even though FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 personnel may not have performed period inspections 
during construction.

                     II. Types of Warranty Companies

    A. An insured warranty company is underwritten by an insurance 
carrier, licensed to operate as an insurer by the states where the 
warranty company plans to operate, and has an acceptable rating from a 
nationally recognized rating company such as A.M. Best Company.
    B. A risk retention group is an insurer which is licensed in one 
state and is authorized, under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act 
of 1981, to issue its policies in all states. This authority is not 
challenged by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354; 
however, there remains some question as to the legal propriety of a 10-
year insured warranty insurer to be a risk-retention group. If at some 
future time any state insurance commission or regulatory agency 
challenges the legal authority of such group, FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 will reconsider its acceptance of the 
group.
    C. Individual state warranty plans, such as that offered by the 
State of New Jersey, are backed by the full faith and credit of the 
state government.

                         III. Plan Requirements

    To be considered acceptable, a warranty plan must include the 
following features:

[[Page 152]]

    A. The entire cost (fee, premium, etc.) of the coverage is prepaid 
and coverage automatically transfers to subsequent owners without 
additional cost.
    B. The coverage is not cancellable by the warrantor (builder), 
warranty company or insurer.
    C. The coverage age includes at least the following:
    (1) For one year from the effective date, any defects caused by 
faulty workmanship of defective materials.
    (2) During the second year after the effective date, the warranty 
continues to cover the wiring, piping and duct work of the electrical, 
plumbing, heating and cooling systems, plus the items in (3).
    (3) During the third through the tenth years, the warranty continues 
to cover major structural defects. A major structural defect is actual 
damage to the load-bearing portion of the home including damage due to 
subsidence, expansion or lateral movement of the soil (excluding 
movement caused by flood or earthquake) which affects its load-bearing 
function and which vitally effects or is imminently likely to affect use 
of the home for residential purposes.
    D. A system is provided for complaint (claims) handling which 
includes a conciliation and, if necessary to resolve matters in dispute, 
arbitration arranged by the American Arbitration Association or similar 
organization.
    E. A construction inspection plan is required if FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is to eliminate the first two 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 inspections or 
permit a full market value loan when FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 inspections are not conducted.

                       IV. Information for Review

    A. Companies submitting warranty plans for a determination of 
acceptability must support requests with the following information.
    (1) Evidence that the insured warranty company has met the 
applicable state licensing and/or regulatory requirements in the state 
in which the company plans to operate.
    (2) Evidence that the insurance carrier underwriting the warranty 
plan is licensed to operate as an insurer in the states in which the 
company plans to operate and has an acceptable rating from a nationally 
recognized company such as A.M. Best Company.
    (3) State warrenty plan agencies will provide evidence that the plan 
is backed by the full faith and credit of the state.
    (4) A full description of the warranty plan including information on 
the fees, builder and home registration procedures, required 
construction standards, construction inspection procedures, coverage 
provided and claims procedures.
    (5) A sample copy of the warranty information and/or policy which is 
provided to the homeowner.
    (6) Suggested means by which FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 field offices can readily assure that the builder is 
a member in good standing prior to loan approval and that a warrant will 
be issued upon the completion of construction prior to the final release 
of funds.
    B. Submission and Acceptance:
    (1) Insured warranty companies, except those operating as risk 
retention groups, and state warranty plan agencies will submit their 
requests and supporting information to the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 State Director in the state in which they plan 
to operate. State Directors will determine the acceptability of insured 
warranty plans and state warranty plans in their jurisdictions, notify 
the company or agency of the decision in writing and notify field 
offices by issuance of a State Supplement including the names and 
addresses of acceptable warranty companies and any other pertinent 
information.
    (2) Warranty companies claiming authority as risk retention groups 
will submit their requests and supporting information including 
certification that it has complied with all requirements of the Products 
Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-45) and information 
indicating the state in which it is licensed, information to the FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 National Office, Single 
Family Housing Processing Division. The National Office will determine 
the acceptability of the warranty of a risk retention group, notify the 
company of the decision in writing and notify field offices by issuance 
of an attachment to this exhibit.

                         V. Warranty Performance

    A. County Supervisors will report inadequate warranty performance 
through their District Director to the State Director. State Directors 
will review the situation, assist in resolving any problems and, if 
necessary, initiate action under subpart F of part 1942 of this chapter. 
State Directors will inform, by memorandum, the Director, Single Family 
Housing Processing Division, National Office, of any problems with 
warranty performance and if any debarment action is initiated.
    B. State Directors will annually monitor each warranty company and/
or its insurer to assure continued compliance with state licensing and/
or regulatory requirements.

               Attachment 1--Acceptable Warranty Companies

    The warranty companies listed below claim authority to act as a risk 
retention group under the Products Liability Risk Retention Act of 1981 
and as such, to operate in

[[Page 153]]

all States to provide 10-year home warranties. This authority remains 
subject to future challenges by any State insurance commissioner or 
regulatory agency; however, until such challenge is made, FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 accepts their warranty.

   Subpart B--Management Advice to Individual Borrowers and Applicants

    Source: 53 FR 35679, Sept. 14, 1988, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.51  General.

    This subpart contains policies for providing management advice to 
all Farm Credit Programs direct loan applicants and borrowers. Forms and 
Farm Assessment and Supervision Reference handbooks are available in any 
Agency county office.

[61 FR 35922, July 9, 1996]


<R05>
Secs. 1924.52-1924.53  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.54  Definitions.

    As used in this subpart, the following definitions apply:
    Agency. This term refers to the Farm Service Agency, its county and 
State committees and their personnel, and any successor agency.
    Commercial classified. The Agency's highest quality Farm Credit 
programs accounts. The financial condition of the borrowers is strong 
enough to enable them to absorb the normal adversities of agricultural 
production and marketing. There is ample security for all loans, there 
is sufficient cash flow to meet the expenses of the agricultural 
enterprise and the financial needs of the family, and to service debts. 
The account is of such quality that commercial lenders would likely view 
the loans as a profitable investment.
    Farm Assessment and Supervision Reference. This reference provides 
guidance to field staff on conducting assessments, year-end analyses, 
and general borrower supervision.
    Farm business plan. The automated or manual Farm and Home Plan 
system which contains a projection that accurately reflects the 
borrower's plan of operation for the production or marketing cycle. The 
annual plan may cover a period of more or less than 12 months. A normal 
year's plan, as defined in this section, will be used when the annual 
plan does not reflect typical income, expenses, and debt payments. The 
Agency will accept farm business plans other than the Farm and Home Plan 
if they provide sufficient information to enable Agency officials to 
render a sound credit decision in accordance with Agency regulations.
    Farm Credit Programs loan. Includes Farm Ownership (FO), Soil and 
Water (SW), Operating (OL), Emergency (EM), Economic Emergency (EE), 
Recreation (RL), Special Livestock (SL), Economic Opportunity (EO) and 
Softwood Timber (ST) loans. Also included are Rural Housing loans for 
farm service buildings (RHF), and Rural Housing (RH) loans where the 
borrower is also indebted for an Agency direct farm loan that is not a 
collection only or judgment account. Non-Program loans, which are 
defined in Sec. 1951.451(a), are excluded.
    Financially viable operation. A financially viable operation 
projects that it can generate sufficient income to meet annual operating 
expenses and debt payments as they become due, meet basic family living 
expenses to the extent they are not met by dependable non-farm income, 
provide for the replacement of capital items, and provide for long-term 
financial progress to enable the operator to obtain commercial credit.
    Individual. The term ``individual'' is used throughout this subpart 
to refer to the person receiving Agency supervision and management 
advice. If an

[[Page 154]]

applicant or borrower applies as an individual applicant, the term 
``individual'' means the operator. In the case of an eligible 
corporation, cooperative, partnership, or joint operation, the term 
``individual'' means the entity members with the primary responsibility 
for making management decisions and carrying out the day-to-day physical 
tasks.
    Normal year plan. A projected farm business plan most 
representative, or typical, of an operation's normal income, expenses 
(including family living expenses), and capital debt payments.
    Prospectus. Consists of a transmittal letter similar to FmHA Guide 
Letter 1951-F-3 with a current balance sheet and projected year's budget 
attached. The applicant or borrower name and address need not be 
withheld from the lender. The prospectus is used to determine lender 
interest in financing or refinancing specific direct loan applicants and 
borrowers. The prospectus will provide information regarding the 
availability of Agency loan guarantee and interest assistance.
    Standard classified. These loan accounts are fully acceptable by 
Agency standards. Loan risk and potential loan servicing costs are 
higher than would be acceptable to other lenders, but all loans are 
adequately secured. Repayment ability is adequate, and there is a high 
probability that all loans will be repaid as scheduled and in full.

[61 FR 35922, July 9, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.55  Assessment of the agricultural operation.

    Assessments will be completed for direct Farm Credit Programs loan 
applicants. An assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of the 
components of an operation, the identification and prioritization of 
training and supervisory needs, and the resulting plan of supervision to 
assist the borrower in achieving financial viability. The assessment is 
the central foundation upon which to build strategies for planning, 
credit and management counseling, loan controls, analysis, borrower 
training, and all other needed supervision. An assessment will include 
thorough inspections of the operation and face-to-face meetings and 
discussions with all key individuals. At least semi-annual reviews of 
progress will be performed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (a) Agency evaluation. The Agency will assess each of the areas 
described in paragraph (b) of this section in close cooperation with the 
applicant or borrower. As part of that assessment, the Agency will 
determine whether the proposed budget is feasible on a direct or 
guaranteed loan basis, the type and nature of any material financial or 
production management weaknesses in the operation, and the specific 
strategy needed, including timeframes, to effect improvements and 
control risks. Material weaknesses are those that have a significant 
impact on the net income of the operation and need to be corrected to 
enable the borrower to progress financially and eventually graduate from 
FSA farm credit programs. Examples of material weaknesses include, but 
are not limited to: lack of a farm recordkeeping system, obsolete or 
inadequate facilities, and use of outdated production practices. In the 
case of Youth loans, it is recognized that most of the component areas 
will be ``Not Applicable'' since there is no full-scale farming 
operation to consider.
    (b) The assessment is an evaluation, conducted with an applicant or 
borrower, of the following components:
    (1) Type of operation.
    (2) Goals.
    (3) Real estate, including facilities.
    (i) Location and size.
    (ii) Proposed and existing improvements.
    (iii) Presence of environmental hazards.
    (iv) Conservation practices and measures.
    (v) Adequacy and continued availability of real estate.
    (vi) External factors, such as urban encroachment and zoning 
changes.
    (4) Chattel property used in the operation.
    (5) Farm business organization and key personnel.
    (6) Historical financial data.
    (7) Projected budget.
    (8) Planned changes.
    (9) Ability to obtain guaranteed credit.

[[Page 155]]

    (c) Supervision and training. Appropriate supervisory oversight and 
training recommendations will be developed based on the Agency's 
evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the operation in 
accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and Sec. 1924.59.
    (d) Performing the year-end analysis. A year-end analysis is 
required for borrowers (except for Youth loans and loans flagged as 
having bankruptcy, foreclosure, or other action pending) the first year 
after an initial or subsequent loan, chattel subordination, or 
restructuring is received, borrowers who are financially distressed or 
delinquent, borrowers who have loans deferred, and borrowers who are 
receiving limited resource interest rates. All other borrowers 
(including flagged accounts) will receive a year-end analysis at the 
discretion and judgment of the Agency. However, at least every two 
years, the borrower will provide upon Agency request, a year-end balance 
sheet, actual financial performance, and a projected farm budget so that 
the borrower can be classified for graduation purposes in accordance 
with subpart F of part 1951. The year-end analysis should coincide with 
the borrower's farm budget planning period. The borrower will work with 
the Agency to:
    (1) Complete the year-end analysis, whenever possible, within the 
60-day period after completion of the borrower's business year or farm 
budget planning period.
    (2) Complete and review the ``actual'' columns on the farm business 
plan and Form FmHA 1962-1, ``Agreement for the Use of Proceeds/Release 
of Chattel Security,'' if applicable.
    (3) Develop a farm business plan for the next production cycle in 
accordance with Sec. 1924.56.
    (4) Reach agreement on key management issues. Any such agreements 
will be documented for the borrower case file and signed by the 
borrower.
    (e) For all borrowers, the assessment described under this section 
will be reviewed on at least a semi-annual basis to monitor progress. 
The borrower will consult with the Agency official in person, or if that 
is not possible, by telephone, or in writing. A meeting must be 
scheduled as soon as practicable to determine corrective options if: the 
borrower is, or expects to be, delinquent; the borrower is experiencing 
difficulties; or other significant changes have occurred. The year-end 
analysis under this section may be treated as one of the required 
assessment reviews.

[61 FR 35922, July 9, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.56  Farm business planning.

    The automated Farm and Home Plan system is the primary tool used by 
the Agency to evaluate loan feasibility and prospects for achieving 
financial viability. Other manual or automated business planning systems 
may be used with the consent of the Agency.
    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) Documentation and revision of plans. Individuals must submit a 
farm business plan to the Agency, upon request, for loan approval and 
servicing purposes. An individual may request the assistance of the 
Agency official, as needed, in completing the plan. Farm business plans 
will be based only on accurate, verifiable information. If the Agency 
official and the individual cannot reach agreement, on the farm business 
plan, then the Agency will make loan approval and servicing 
determinations based on the Agency's separate, revised farm business 
plan. The individual will have the right to appeal any resulting adverse 
decision.
    (1) Historical information will be used as a guide to evaluate the 
feasibility of projected farm business plans. Individuals must provide 
the Agency with their previous 5-year production history, if available. 
Positive and negative trends, mutually agreed upon changes and 
improvements, and current input prices, will be taken into consideration 
when arriving at reasonable projections.
    (i) For individuals with less than a 5-year history, actual 
production records from an operation to be taken over by the individual 
will be considered, whenever available.
    (ii) In the absence of the information listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) 
of this section, other reliable data sources that may be used include: 
FSA Farm Programs (formerly Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation 
Service) actual

[[Page 156]]

yield records and county or State averages.
    (iii) This paragraph applies when an accurate projection cannot be 
made because the individual's production history in any or all of the 
previous 5 years has been substantially affected by a disaster that has 
been declared by the President or designated by the Secretary of 
Agriculture. This paragraph also applies to those individuals who would 
have had a qualifying physical or production loss, as defined in 
Sec. 1945.154(a), from such a disaster, but who were not located in a 
designated or declared disaster area.
    (A) If the individual's disaster years yields are less than the 
county average yields, county average yields will be used for those 
years. If county average yields are not available, State average yields 
will be used.
    (B) In calculating a baseline average yield, the individual may 
exclude the production year with the lowest actual or county average 
yield, providing the individual's yields were affected by disasters 
during at least 2 of the 5 years.
    (2) Unit prices for agricultural commodities as published in the 
State supplement will generally be used. However, regional or county 
unit prices may be used when there are transportation costs or other 
significant factors that cause a difference in commodity prices within 
the State. Individuals who can provide reliable evidence that they will 
receive a premium price for a commodity will be allowed to use the 
higher price for farm planning. The determination of disaster years will 
be based on the 5-year history of disaster declarations or designations 
for all counties contained in the State supplement.
    (3) When the Agency official and individual revise the farm business 
plan, the plan will be signed and initialed by both parties. Form FmHA 
1962-1 (available in any Agency office) will be revised whenever 
significant changes occur during the year that will affect repayment 
ability. It is the individual's responsibility to notify the Agency of 
any necessary changes. If the changes would result in a major change in 
the operation, a completely new farm business plan must be developed. 
The individual and Agency official will initial and date revisions to 
the Form FmHA 1962-1.
    (4) If the borrower and Agency cannot reach an agreement on 
revisions to the farm plan and an adverse decision results, the borrower 
may appeal. During an appeal, the Agency will make releases of normal 
income security for essential family living and farm operating expenses 
in accordance with Sec. 1962.17. If the borrower refuses to execute Form 
FmHA 1962-1 as finally determined by the Agency after an appeal, the 
account will be serviced under Sec. 1962.18. If the borrower does not 
appeal, the planned releases documented on Form FmHA 1962-1 are binding.

Sec. 1924.57  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.58  Recordkeeping.

    (a) All borrowers must have a recordkeeping system, which must be 
documented as part of the assessment under Sec. 1924.55.
    (b) The selected recordkeeping system must provide information 
similar to that contained in Forms FmHA 431-2, FmHA 432-1, ``Farm Family 
Record Book,'' and FmHA 432-2, ``Five Year Inventory Record.'' The 
recordkeeping system must enable borrowers to make informed management 
decisions and allow the Agency to render loan making and servicing 
decisions in accordance with Agency program regulations.
    (c) Borrowers must maintain accurate records and submit financial 
information to the Agency when required. Failure to do so will result in 
the borrower's ineligibility for future Agency financing and loan 
servicing and may result in acceleration and collection action.

[61 FR 35924, July 9, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.59  Supervision.

    The Agency's supervision is based on the information and evaluation 
resulting from the assessment of the operation. The borrower is required 
to:
    (a) Cooperate with the Agency and comply with all supervisory 
agreements, farm plans, and all other loan-related requirements.
    (b) Promptly notify the Agency of any significant change in the 
business

[[Page 157]]

or family expenses or the development of problem situations.
    (c) Maintain and protect the collateral for Agency loans and 
promptly report to the Agency any losses or other significant changes in 
the collateral.
    (d) Complete any training required by Sec. 1924.74.

[61 FR 35924, July 9, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.60  Nonfarm enterprises.

    A nonfarm enterprise is any business enterprise which supplements 
farm income by providing goods or services for which there is a need and 
a reasonably reliable market. The same general policies covered in this 
subpart for giving management assistance to an applicant or borrower on 
farm loans will be followed in dealing with an applicant or borrower on 
nonfarm enterprise loans. The appropriate plans and record book will be 
used for the nonfarm enterprise. The borrower responsibilities in 
Sec. 1924.59(a) also apply to nonfarm enterprises.

<R05>
Secs. 1924.61-1924.73  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.74  Borrower Training program.

    (a) Introduction. (1) Supervised credit includes helping borrowers 
to develop the skills necessary for successful, efficient production and 
financial management of a farm business. An effective, formal training 
program provides a solid foundation on which borrowers can build the 
skills which will enable them to become efficient, financially sound 
producers who can obtain commercial financing. The goal of this training 
is for borrowers to develop and improve the financial and production 
management skills necessary to successfully operate a farm, build equity 
in the farm business, and become financially successful to graduate from 
Agency programs to commercial sources of credit.
    (2) The authorities contained in this section require certain Farm 
Credit Programs borrowers to obtain training in production and financial 
management concepts. Unless waived, this training will be an eligibility 
requirement for all Farm Credit Programs direct and guaranteed loans. 
The training requirement will also apply to all direct borrowers who 
receive Primary Loan Servicing actions approved under subpart S of part 
1951 of this chapter, with the exception of net recovery buyout offers. 
Borrowers who do not request new loans or servicing actions will be 
notified during farm visits and annual analyses of approved courses in 
their area. Also, a current list of approved courses will be posted in 
the County Office.
    (3) The training will be carried out by public and/or private sector 
providers of farm management and credit counseling services (including, 
but not limited to, community colleges, the Extension Service, State 
Departments of Agriculture, farm management firms, lenders, and similar 
qualified organizations).
    (4) State Directors will enter into agreements with one or more 
qualified providers in each State to conduct the training.
    (b) Processing--(1) Agency review. The determination of an 
applicant/borrower's need for enhanced training in production and 
financial management concepts will be made by the Agency. To make this 
determination, the Agency will review the case file (in the case of 
borrowers) and the complete application package for the assistance 
requested. A decision that the applicant/borrower needs such training 
cannot be used as a basis for rejecting the request for assistance. In 
the case of a cooperative, corporation, partnership, or joint operation, 
any individual member, stockholder, partner, or joint operator holding a 
majority interest in the entity or who is operating the farm must agree 
to complete the training on behalf of the entity. However, if one entity 
member is solely responsible for financial or production management, 
then only that entity member will be required to complete the training 
in that area for the entity or qualify for a partial waiver. If the 
financial and production functions of the farming operation are shared, 
the knowledge and skills of the individual(s) with the responsibility of 
production and/or financial management of the operation will be 
considered in the aggregate for granting a waiver or requiring that 
training be completed. If a waiver is

[[Page 158]]

not granted, these individuals will be required to complete the training 
in accordance with their responsibilities for production and/or 
financial management. This training must be completed within 2 years 
after ``Agreement to Complete Training,'' is signed if a waiver is not 
granted. When production training is required, a borrower must complete 
course work covering production management in crop or livestock 
enterprises which constitute twenty percent of the projected cash farm 
income for the coming production cycle, as determined by the Agency. 
Borrowers who are adding a new enterprise must agree to complete any 
required production training in that enterprise unless a waiver is 
granted by the Agency. Borrowers must also complete financial management 
training unless a waiver has been granted by the Agency.
    (i) Loan applicants. After the Agency has determined that the 
applicant meets all eligibility criteria for the type of assistance 
requested, the Agency will consider the applicant's need for enhanced 
training in production and financial management concepts. If the Agency 
determines the applicant is ineligible for assistance, the training 
requirement will not be considered.
    (ii) Requests for Primary Loan Servicing. Prior to Agency offer of 
any Primary Loan Servicing action, the Agency must determine whether the 
borrower must complete a training program or qualifies for a waiver. 
This determination should be made after a feasible plan has been 
developed using consolidation, rescheduling, reamortization, deferral, 
softwood timber, and/or writedown, but prior to Agency actual offer to 
restructure the borrower's accounts. This training requirement does not 
apply to those borrowers offered net recovery buyout or preservation 
loan servicing. If the borrower must complete a training program, fees 
will be included in the plan as an operating expense.
    (2) Waivers. Applicants for loans and Primary Loan Servicing 
programs may request a waiver from the training requirement by 
submitting Form FmHA 1924-27, ``Request for Waiver of Borrower Training 
Requirements,'' with the application for assistance. The waiver request 
must include the required documentation and records as specified in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section. A waiver is not 
required for those applicants who have previously received a waiver, or 
who have previously satisfied the training requirements. The applicant/
borrower must meet all training requirements for both production and 
financial management if no waiver is granted. If the borrower receives a 
waiver for production training, the requirements for financial 
management training must still be met. Conversely, if the borrower 
receives a waiver for financial management training, the requirements 
for production training must still be met. In the case of entity 
applicants, only those entity members who hold a majority interest in 
the operation or who operate the farm must meet the waiver conditions 
for the entity to qualify for a waiver. However, if one entity member is 
solely responsible for financial or production management, then only 
that entity member will be required to complete the training in that 
area for the entity or qualify for a partial waiver. If the financial 
and production functions of the farming operation are shared, the 
knowledge and skills of the individual(s) with the responsibility of 
production and/or financial management of the operation will be 
considered in the aggregate for granting a waiver or requiring that 
training be completed. If a waiver is not granted, these individuals 
will be required to complete the training in accordance with their 
responsibilities for production and/or financial management. The Agency 
may waive the financial and/or production training requirements under 
the following conditions:
    (i) The applicant has successfully completed an equivalent training 
program. To meet this requirement, the applicant must submit evidence of 
completion of a production and/or financial management course similar to 
a course approved under this section. The submission must include a 
description of the content and subjects covered in the course(s) 
completed by the applicant or entity members. The submission must also 
include evidence of

[[Page 159]]

completion, such as a grade report, certificate of completion, or 
written certification by the course instructor. The program must have 
covered subject areas in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section. The 
Agency will review the documentation submitted by the applicant(s) for 
assistance to determine whether the training completed satisfies the 
training requirements of this section; or
    (ii) The applicant has the experience and/or training which 
demonstrates the abilities necessary for successful, efficient 
production as determined by the Agency based on documentation provided 
by the applicant with the request for the waiver. This documentation 
must include, at a minimum, the applicant's production records for the 
past 5 years and a statement explaining how the records demonstrate 
production ability.
    (3) Notifying applicants/borrowers of the the Agency's decision 
regarding training. The applicant/borrower will be informed of the the 
Agency's decision as follows:
    (i) Loan applicants receiving a waiver from the training will be 
notified in the letter of eligibility, required under Sec. 1910.6 of 
subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter. Applicants for Primary Loan 
Servicing actions who are receiving a waiver will be notified through 
exhibit B or exhibit F to subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter, as 
appropriate.
    (ii) Loan applicants required to complete the training will be 
notified in the letter of eligibility. Applicants for Primary Loan 
Servicing actions who are required to complete the training will be 
notified through exhibit B or exhibit F to subpart S of part 1951 of 
this chapter, as appropriate. The notification will include the name(s) 
of the approved vendor(s) in the applicant/borrower's area and the 
specific courses required. The notification to the applicant/borrower 
will also include a description of the scoring system to be used to 
determine if the applicant/borrower has successfully met the training 
requirements. In both loan making and servicing cases, the decision to 
require certain training is not appealable. However, the decision is 
reviewable.
    (4) Notification of applicants determined ineligible for assistance. 
In the letter informing them of the Agency's decision, applicants 
determined ineligible for assistance due to lack of management training 
and experience will be notified, for their information, of training 
programs approved under this section. If the ineligible applicant 
chooses to enroll in a training program, eligibility for future 
assistance will not be automatic upon completion of the course. 
Applicants who complete an approved course and later apply for a new 
loan must still demonstrate that they possess sufficient training and 
experience to assure reasonable prospects of success and meet other 
eligibility requirements for the assistance requested.
    (5) Contacting vendor and payment. Upon receiving the notification 
of the training requirement, the borrower is responsible for selecting 
and contacting a vendor(s), and making all arrangements to begin the 
training. Agency is not a party to fee or other agreements between the 
borrower and the vendor. Training fees must be included in the plan of 
operation as a farm operating expense. Payment of training fees is an 
authorized use of operating loan funds.
    (6) Training agreement. Prior to closing the loan or Primary Loan 
Servicing action, the applicant/borrower must sign Form FmHA 1924-23. 
This agreement will be placed in position 2 of the borrower case file.
    (7) Automated tracking system. Field offices will process certain 
data to the automated Finance Office records in order to properly track 
borrower training-related information. Reference the automated system 
user manuals for more specific information on this automated tracking 
system.
    (8) County Office monitoring. Required training will be included in 
table C of Form FmHA 431-2. Agency personnel will monitor borrower 
progress during farm visits and analyses in accordance with this 
subpart. The County Supervisor will also contact the borrower to follow 
up on unsatisfactory training progress reports. All contacts with the 
borrower will be noted in the running case record, together with the 
topics discussed and agreements reached.

[[Page 160]]

    (c) Vendor's evaluation of borrower progress--(1) All required 
training must be completed within 2 years after the borrower signs Form 
FmHA 1924-23. The County Supervisor may grant a 1-year written extension 
to the agreement in cases where the borrower demonstrates he/she was 
unable to complete the training due to circumstances beyond his/her 
control, such as poor health or discontinuance of the necessary approved 
courses. Refusal to grant a 1-year extension is not an appealable 
decision.
    (2) The vendor will provide Agency with periodic progress reports. 
The frequency of these reports will be determined by the State Director. 
These reports are not intended to reflect a grade or score, but to 
indicate whether the borrower is attending sessions and honestly 
endeavoring to complete the training program. Upon completion of the 
training, the vendor will provide the County Office with an evaluation 
of the borrower's knowledge of the course material. This evaluation 
shall specifically address the borrower's improvement toward meeting the 
goals outlined in this section. The instructor will also assign the 
borrower a score according to the following criteria:

                                  Score

    1.  The borrower attended classroom sessions as agreed, 
satisfactorily completed all assignments, and demonstrated an 
understanding of the course material.
    2.  The borrower attended classroom sessions as agreed and attempted 
to complete all assignments; however, the borrower does not demonstrate 
an understanding of the course material.
    3.  The borrower did not attend classroom sessions as agreed and/or 
did not attempt to complete assignments. In general, the borrower did 
not make a good faith effort to complete the training.

    (i) Borrowers receiving a score of 1 will have met the requirements 
of the agreement. The accounts of these borrowers will be serviced in 
accordance with existing regulations.
    (ii) Borrowers receiving a score of 2 will have met the requirements 
of the agreement. However, since these borrowers do not adequately 
demonstrate an understanding of the course material, the County 
Supervisor will develop a plan outlining the additional supervision the 
borrower will require to accomplish the objectives of Agency assistance, 
such as recommending further training, more frequent farm visits, or 
retaining professional services of an accountant, farm management 
consultant, or similar expert based upon the borrower's abilities.
    (iii) Borrowers receiving a score of 3 will not have met the 
requirements of the agreement for training. Failure to complete the 
training as agreed will cause the borrower to be ineligible for future 
Agency benefits including future direct and guaranteed loans, Primary 
Loan Servicing, Interest Assistance renewals, and restructuring of 
guaranteed loans.
    (d) Selection and approval of organizations and courses--(1) 
Identification of potential vendors. Prior to the initial approval of 
vendors and prior to renewal of approved vendor's training agreements, 
the State Director or designee shall solicit applications from all 
interested organizations, keeping in mind its cultural diversity 
responsibilities. The State Director shall contact the Chief Executive 
Officer of the State and appropriate officials from the State Department 
of Agriculture, the State Extension Service, community colleges, and 
other private or nonprofit organizations which may be interested in 
conducting this training.
    (2) Application. The vendor must submit the following items prior to 
consideration for approval:
    (i) A sample of the course materials and a description of the 
method(s) of training to be used.
    (ii) Specific training objectives for each section of the course. 
These objectives should relate to the general objectives outlined in 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.
    (iii) A detailed course agenda specifying the topics to be covered, 
the time to be devoted to each topic, and the number of sessions to be 
attended.
    (iv) A list of instructors and their qualifications, and the 
criteria by which additional instructors will be selected.
    (v) The proposed locations where training will take place. These 
sites should be within a reasonable commuting distance for borrowers to 
be served by the vendor.

[[Page 161]]

    (vi) Cost per participant and/or cost per organization, i.e., cost 
for husband/wife joint operation; father/son partnership; or multiple 
members of a corporation.
    (vii) Minimum and/or maximum class size.
    (viii) A description of the organization's experience in developing 
and administering training to farmers.
    (ix) A description of the monitoring and/or quality control methods 
the organization intends to use.
    (x) A description of the policy on allowing Agency employees to 
attend the course for monitoring purposes, i.e., the number of employees 
authorized to attend; the cost (if any); and the number of classes each 
employee can attend.
    (xi) A description of how the needs of borrowers with physical and/
or mental handicaps or learning disabilities will be met.
    (xii) A plan of how the needs of borrowers for whom English is not 
their primary language will be met.
    (3) State Office review and recommendation. Upon receipt of the 
application packages from the potential vendors, the State Director will 
review the material to assure the vendor's proposal meets the following 
minimum criteria for accomplishment of educational objectives, 
instructor qualifications, curriculum content, and vendor qualification:
    (i) Educational objectives. Upon completion of the course, the 
borrower shall be able to:
    (A) Describe the specific goals of the business, describe what 
changes are required to attain the business goals, and outline how these 
changes will occur using present and projected enterprise budgets.
    (B) Maintain and utilize a financial management information system 
which includes financial and production records, a household budget, a 
statement of financial condition, and an accrual adjusted income 
statement. The borrower shall also be able to use this system when 
making financial and production decisions.
    (C) Understand and utilize an income statement. Specifically, the 
borrower must understand the structure and major components of an income 
statement and its role in analyzing the performance of a business, be 
familiar with the cash and accrual methods of determining net farm 
income, and understand the relationship between a balance sheet and an 
income statement.
    (D) Understand and utilize a balance sheet. Specifically, the 
borrower must understand the major components of a balance sheet and its 
role in analyzing the business, be familiar with the categories of 
assets and liabilities and be able to provide examples of entries under 
each, and be familiar with the cost and market methods of valuing assets 
and liabilities and the advantages of each method.
    (E) Understand and utilize a cash flow budget. Specifically, the 
applicant must be able to explain and justify estimates for production 
and expenses, and analyze the cash flow to identify potential problems.
    (F) Using production records and other production information, be 
able to identify problems, evaluate alternatives, and make needed 
corrections to current production practices to achieve greater 
efficiency and profitability.
    (ii) Instructor qualifications. Instructor qualifications will be 
reviewed to assure sufficient knowledge of the material and sufficient 
experience in adult education. The instructors must have a bachelor's 
degree or comparable experience in the subject area they will teach and 
a minimum of three years experience in conducting training courses or 
teaching. Also, the instructors must successfully complete any 
instructor training which may be associated with the Agency approved 
course.
    (iii) Curriculum. The curriculum shall be reviewed to assure that 
the following subject matter is sufficiently addressed. A single vendor 
is not required to provide all the courses necessary to cover the entire 
curriculum; however, to the extent practicable, all topics must be 
available for all Agency districts. The State Director shall identify 
the specific crop or livestock enterprises for which training must be 
available in a given area or district, and any additional subject matter 
to be covered for each.

[[Page 162]]

    (A) Business Planning. The course(s) shall cover the general areas 
of goal setting, risk management, and planning. Goal setting will 
include identification of personal and family goals, business goals, and 
short- and long-term goals. Risk management concepts will include the 
sources, magnitude and frequency of risk, risk tolerance, risk-taking 
ability of the business, and strategies for managing risk such as use of 
credit, marketing, production practices, and insurance. Finally, the 
course(s) will guide the borrower through the formulation of a long-term 
business plan for the farm and presentation of this plan to a lender.
    (B) Financial Management Systems. The course(s) shall cover all 
aspects of farm accounting, specifically: Instruction in financial 
record keeping, preparation of a household budget, development and 
analysis of accrual adjusted income statements, balance sheets, and cash 
flow budgets. The course(s) shall focus on integrating these elements 
into a financial management system which enables the borrower to make 
business decisions based on his/her analysis of financial information.
    (C) Crop Production. The course(s) shall focus on improving the 
profitability of the borrower's crop enterprises. Specifically, the 
course shall address keeping and analyzing production records, 
identifying problems in current production practices, identifying 
sources of production information and assistance, and using production 
information to analyze alternatives and identify the most profitable 
solution.
    (D) Livestock Production. The course(s) shall focus on improving the 
profitability of the borrower's livestock enterprises. Specifically, the 
course shall address keeping and analyzing production records, 
identifying problems in current production practices, identifying 
sources of production information and assistance, and using production 
information to analyze alternatives and identify the most profitable 
solution.
    (iv) Vendor. The proposed vendor of the training must have 
demonstrated a minimum of three years experience in conducting training 
courses or teaching the proposed subject matter.
    (4) Approval. After review of the applications, the State Director 
shall determine which vendors should be recommended for final approval. 
Complete application packages from the selected vendors should be 
submitted to the National Office for concurrence prior to final 
approval. Applications from accredited colleges (including community 
colleges) or universities, however, do not require National Office 
concurrence prior to final approval. If all of the instructors have not 
been selected at the time of request for approval of the vendor, the 
vendor may be approved with the condition that instructors will meet the 
criteria set out in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. After 
approval, the State Director and the vendor(s) will sign Form FmHA 1924-
24, ``Agreement to Conduct Production and Financial Management Training 
for Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 Borrowers.'' This agreement will be valid for three years, 
unless revoked in writing and giving 30 days notice by the State 
Director or the vendor. The State Director may revoke the agreement if 
the vendor does not comply with the responsibilities listed in the 
agreement. Such revocation is nonappealable. The State Director will 
issue a State supplement to this subpart listing the approved vendor(s), 
the contact person for the vendor, the terms of the vendor agreements, 
and the subject matter in which each vendor is approved to conduct 
training.
    (5) Renewals. Renewal of agreements to conduct training will not be 
automatic. The vendor must request renewal in writing, provide updates 
to any changes in curricula, and provide information which indicates the 
training provided by the vendor is effective. Such information may 
include course evaluations, test scores, or statistics on the 
improvement of borrowers who have completed the course. The State 
Director must obtain National Office concurrence on any decisions to 
deny renewal of a vendor's agreement. A decision to deny renewal of a 
vendor's agreement is nonappealable.
    (e) Vendor monitoring. An operational file will be maintained in the 
State Office for each approved vendor. This file

[[Page 163]]

will include the application, National Office concurrence (if required), 
the signed Form FmHA 1924-24, documentation of Agency monitoring of the 
vendor, and any further documentation to determine the success of the 
vendor's program. To assure the training organization is correctly and 
effectively implementing the training as proposed, the State Director or 
designee will be responsible for monitoring the vendor. This monitoring 
shall, as a minimum, consist of:
    (1) Attendance at selected training sessions for each vendor to 
verify that the agreed-upon subject matter is being covered in 
sufficient detail and to assess the effectiveness of the training 
provided by the instructors.
    (2) Review of course and instructor evaluations. Course and 
instructor evaluations will be completed by the borrowers on Form FmHA 
1924-22, ``Borrower Training Course Evaluation.'' This form will be 
provided to the borrowers by the instructor as they complete the course. 
The evaluations will be forwarded to the State Director for review. The 
results will be summarized and made part of the operational file on each 
vendor.
    (3) Monitoring of borrowers' improvement upon completion of a 
course. The State Director will analyze statistics regarding borrower 
performance, such as the graduation and delinquency of borrowers who 
have completed the required training course.

 Exhibit A to Subpart B--Letter to Borrower Regarding Releases of Farm 
         Income To Pay Family Living and Farm Operating Expenses

                 UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

  Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
                                 103-354

                            (Insert Address)

(Date)
Borrower's Name)
(Address)
    Dear ______:
    Public Law 100-233 requires the Agency to notify you that you are 
entitled to have Agency release proceeds from the sale of crops, 
livestock, and livestock products planned to be marketed in the regular 
course of business including ASCS and CCC payments, so that you can pay 
essential family living and farm operating expenses. The releases will 
continue until such time as your account should become in default and 
Agency has to accelerate your account.
    To provide these releases to you, Agency regulations require that 
you fill out Form FmHA 1962-1 to explain what items of Agency security 
you intend to sell during this crop year. Please see attachment 1 of 
this letter for an explanation of this form. We request that you contact 
this office within 10 days of when you receive this letter so that we 
can complete this form and you can receive releases on a timely basis.

    Sincerely,

_______________________________________________________________________
County Supervisor

                        Attachment 1 to Exhibit A

    Periodically, you will be asked to complete Form FmHA 1962-1, 
``Agreement for the Use of Proceeds/Release of Chattel Security,'' which 
will document the agreement between you and the Agency as to how 
proceeds from the sale of chattel property which serves as security for 
your Agency loans will be released. You will also need to list those 
buyers to whom you plan to sell your farm products. This plan will give 
you and the Agency a clear idea of what income you expect from your 
operation and how those proceeds will be used. The plan will set forth 
the amount of money required for paying essential family living, farm 
operating expenses, and debt service payments. You and the Agency must 
agree on how much money will be released

[[Page 164]]

from your crop proceeds. Such releases must be in accordance with Agency 
regulations.
    If the County Supervisor is unable to agree with and approve your 
plan for the use of the sales proceeds, you will receive a letter 
explaining why the County Supervisor is unable to approve your plan and 
how you may appeal the County Supervisor's decision. While an appeal is 
pending, Agency will release sales proceeds to be used to pay essential 
family living and farm operation expenses.
    Once a plan has been agreed on, it is important that you abide by 
the plan. The plan can always be revised or changed, as circumstances 
require, provided you and Agency can agree to the revisions.
    Planned sales can be listed by month, by quarter or by whatever 
period suits your operation the best. The form does not have to be 
completed to show each individual animal, bushel, bale, etc. The form is 
a plan: it contains only projections. We expect your projections to be 
realistic and based on your past experience, but we know that you cannot 
predict exactly how many bushels per acre you will harvest, exactly how 
many animals you will wean, etc. We also realize that you cannot predict 
prices to the penny. Sometimes you will have a buyer for your products 
who is not listed on the form. All we expect of you is to be as accurate 
as you can. Later, if the plan needs to be changed, you and the County 
Supervisor can work together to revise it. Many revisions can be agreed 
on over the telephone and a trip to the County Office is not always 
needed. You are not required to check with Agency before making a sale 
just because the price you expected to receive is different from what 
you had planned to receive. However, a difference in price might require 
your plan to be revised, so Agency wants to be told about the difference 
as soon as possible after the sale is made. you are expected to obtain 
Agency approval before making a major change in your operation or before 
you use sale proceeds in a way different than you agreed to.
    If at all possible, you should let Agency know if you are going to 
sell to a buyer who is not listed on the form. The attached chart gives 
certain examples when you must get prior consent from the Agency and 
when you may advise Agency after the sales of your farm products.

<R05>
Sec. 1924.101  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes the basic Rural Housing Service (RHS) 
policies for planning and performing site development work. It also 
provides the procedures and guidelines for preparing site development 
plans consistent with Federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.

[[Page 165]]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.102  General policy.

    (a) Rural development. This subpart provides for the development of 
building sites and related facilities in rural areas. It is designed to:
    (1) Recognize community needs and desires in local planning, 
control, and development.
    (2) Recognize standards for building-site design which encourage and 
lead to the development of economically stable communities, and the 
creation of attractive, healthy, and permanent living environments.
    (3) Encourage improvements planned for the site to be the most cost-
effective of the practicable alternatives. Encourage utilities and 
services utilized to be reliable, efficient, and available at reasonable 
costs.
    (4) Provide for a planning process that will consider impacts on the 
environment and existing development in order to formulate actions that 
protect, enhance, and restore environmental quality.
    (5) No site will be approved unless it meets the requirements of 
this part and all state and local permits and approvals in connection 
with the proposed development have been obtained.
    (b) Subdivisions. RHS does not review or approve subdivisions. Each 
site approved by RHS must meet the requirements of Sec. 1924.115, on a 
site by site basis.
    (c) Development related costs. (1) Applicant. The applicant is 
responsible for all costs incurred before loan or grant closing 
associated with planning, technical services, and actual construction. 
These costs may be included in the loan or grant as authorized by RHS 
regulations.
    (2) Developer. The developer is responsible for payment of all costs 
associated with development.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.103  Scope.

    This subpart provides supplemental requirements for Rural Rental 
Housing (RRH) loans, Rural Cooperative Housing (RCH) loans, Farm Labor 
Housing (LH) loans and grants, and Rural Housing Site (RHS) loans. It 
also provides a site development standard, as indicated in exhibit B of 
FmHA Instruction 1924-C (available in any RHS field office), which 
supplements this subpart to provide the minimum for the acceptability of 
development. All of this subpart applies to Single Family Housing unless 
otherwise noted. All of this subpart also applies to Multiple Family 
Housing except Secs. 1924.115 and 1924.120, and any paragraph 
specifically designated for Single Family Housing only. In addition, RHS 
will consult with appropriate Federal, state, and local agencies, other 
organizations, and individuals to implement the provisions of this 
subpart.

climate, adjacent land use, environmental impacts, energy efficiency, 
local economy, aesthetic and cultural values, public and private 
services, housing and social conditions, and a degree of flexibility to 
accommodate changing demands. All planning and performing development 
work is the responsibility of the applicant or developer. All 
development will be arranged and completed according to applicable 
local, state, or Federal regulations including applicable health and 
safety standards, environmental requirements, and requirements of this 
subpart. When a public authority requires inspections prior to final 
acceptance, written assurance by the responsible public authority of 
compliance with local, city, county, state or other public codes, 
regulations, and ordinances is required prior to final acceptance by 
RHS.
    (1) [Reserved]

services must be performed by professionals who are qualified and 
authorized to provide such services in the state in which the project 
would be developed. All technical services must be provided in 
accordance with the requirements of professional registration or 
licensing boards. At completion of all construction or completion of a 
phase or phases of the total project, the persons providing technical 
services under this section must notify the RHS field office in writing 
that all work has been completed in substantial conformance with the 
approved plans and specifications.
    (iii) For developments not specifically required to have technical

<R05>
Sec. 1924.106  Location.

    (a) General. It is RHS's policy to promote compact community 
development and not to approve sites located in floodplains, on 
wetlands, or on important farmlands, unless there is no practical 
alternative. Furthermore, RHS will not finance development on locations 
that adversely affect properties which are listed or are eligible for 
listing on the National Register of Historic Places, located within the 
Coastal Barrier Resource System, or on a barrier island. (Environmental 
requirements are found in 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G.) In order to be 
eligible for RHS participation:
    (1) The site must be located in an eligible area as defined in the 
program regulations under which the development is being funded or 
approved.
    (2) The site must comply with the applicable environmental laws, 
regulations, Executive Orders, and subpart G of part 1940.
    (b) Single Family Housing. In addition to the general requirements 
in paragraph (a) of this section, sites must provide a desirable, safe, 
functional, convenient, and attractive living environment for the 
residents.
    (c) Multiple Family Housing. Multiple family housing projects shall 
be located in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (r) of 
Sec. 1944.215. Locating sites in less than desirable locations of the 
community because they are in close proximity to undesirable influences 
such as high activity railroad tracks; adjacent to or behind industrial 
sites; bordering sites or structures which are not decent, safe, or 
sanitary; or bordering sites which have potential environmental concerns 
such as processing plants, etc., is not acceptable. Screening such sites 
does not make them acceptable. Sites which are not an integral part of a 
residential community and do not have a reasonable access, either by 
location or terrain, to essential community facilities such as water, 
sewerage, schools, shopping, employment opportunities, medical 
facilities, etc., are not acceptable.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.107  Utilities.

    All development under this subpart must have adequate, economic, 
safe, energy efficient, dependable utilities with sufficient easements 
for installation and maintenance.
    (a) Water and wastewater disposal systems. (1) Single Family 
Housing. If sites are served by central water or sewer systems, the 
systems must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section. If sites have individual water or sewer systems, they must 
meet the requirements of the state department of health or other 
comparable reviewing and regulatory authority and the minimum 
requirements of exhibit B (available in any RHS field office), 
paragraphs V and VI. Sites in subdivisions of more than 25 dwelling 
units on individual systems, or sites that do not meet the requirements 
of exhibit B, paragraphs V and VI, must have state director concurrence.
    (2) Multiple Family Housing. Proposals processed under this 
paragraph shall be served by centrally owned and operated water and 
wastewater disposal systems unless this is determined by RHS to be 
economically or environmentally not feasible. All central systems, 
whether they are public, community, or private, shall meet the design 
requirements of the state department of health or other comparable 
reviewing and regulatory authority. The regulatory authority will verify 
in writing that the water and wastewater systems are in compliance with 
the current provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean 
Water Act, respectively.
    (i) Sites which are not presently served by a central system, but 
are scheduled for tie-in to the central system within 2 years, should 
have all lines installed during the initial construction. Such sites 
must have an approved interim water supply or wastewater disposal system 
installed capable of satisfactory service until the scheduled tie-in 
occurs.
    (ii) In addition to written assurance of compliance with state and 
local requirements, there must be assurance of continuous service at 
reasonable rates for central water and wastewater disposal systems. 
Public ownership is preferred whenever possible. In cases

[[Page 168]]

where interim facilities are installed pending extension or construction 
of permanent public services, the developer must assume responsibility 
for the operation and maintenance of the interim facility or establish 
an entity for its operation and maintenance which is acceptable to the 
local governing body. If a system is not or will not be publicly owned 
and operated, it must comply with one of the following:
    (A) Be an organization that meets the ownership and operating 
requirements for a water or wastewater disposal system that RHS could 
finance under 7 CFR part 1942, subpart A or be dedicated to and accepted 
by such an organization.
    (B) Be an organization or individual that meets other acceptable 
methods of ownership and operation as outlined in HUD Handbook 4075.12, 
``Ownership and Organization of Central Water and Sewerage Systems.'' 
RHS should be assured that the organization has the right, in its sole 
discretion, to enforce the obligation of the operator of the water and 
sewerage systems to provide satisfactory continuous service at 
reasonable rates.
    (C) Be adequately controlled as to rates and services by a public 
body (unit of Government or public services commission).
    (iii) Multiple family developments of more than 25 units with 
individual system must have national office concurrence.
    (A) [Reserved]
    (B) Supporting information for the proposed individual water 
systems, covering the following points:
    (1) In areas where difficulty is anticipated in developing an 
acceptable water supply, the availability of a water supply will be 
determined before closing the loan.
    (2) Documentation must be provided that the quality of the supply 
meets the chemical, physical, and bacteriological standards of the 
regulatory authority having jurisdiction. The maximum contaminant levels 
of U.S. EPA shall apply. Individual water systems must be tested for 
quantity and bacteriological quality. Where problems are anticipated 
with chemical quality, chemical tests may be required. Chemical tests 
would be limited to analysis for the defects common to the area such as 
iron and manganese, hardness, nitrates, pH, turbidity, color, or other 
undesirable elements. Polluted or contaminated water supplies are 
unacceptable. In all cases, assurance of a potable water supply before 
loan closing is required.
    (C) Supporting information for individual wastewater disposal 
systems with subsurface discharge provided by a soil scientist, 
geologist, soils engineer, or other person recognized by the local 
regulatory authority. This data must include the following:
    (1) Assurance of nonpollution of ground water. The local regulatory 
authority having jurisdiction must be consulted to ensure that 
installation of individual wastewater systems will not pollute ground 
water sources or create other health hazards or otherwise violate State 
water quality standards.
    (2) Records of percolation tests. Guidance for performing these 
tests is included in the EPA design manual, ``Onsite Wastewater 
Treatment and Disposal Systems'' and the minimum RHS requirements are in 
exhibit B, paragraph VI. (These may be waived by the state director when 
the state has established other acceptable means for allowing onsite 
disposal.)
    (3) Determination of soil types and description. The assistance of 
the SCS or other qualified persons should be obtained for soil type 
determination and a copy of its recommendations included in the 
documentation.
    (4) Description of ground water elevations, showing seasonal 
variations.
    (5) Confirmation of space allowances. An accurate drawing to 
indicate that there is adequate space available to satisfactorily locate 
the individual water and wastewater disposal systems; likewise, 
documented assurance of compliance with all local requirements. 
Structures served by wastewater disposal systems with subsurface 
discharge require larger sites than those structures served by another 
type system.
    (6) Description of exploratory pit observations, if available.
    (D) Supporting information for individual wastewater disposal 
systems with surface discharge covering the following points:

[[Page 169]]

    (1) Effluent standards issued by the appropriate regulatory agency 
that controls the discharge of the proposed individual systems. 
Assurance from this regulatory agency that the effluent standards will 
not be exceeded by the individual systems being proposed must be 
included.
    (2) Program of maintenance, parts, and service available to the 
system-owner for upkeep of the system.
    (3) A plan for local inspection of the system by a responsible 
agency with the authority to ensure compliance with health and safety 
standards.
    (b) Electric service. The power supplier will be consulted by the 
applicant to assure that there is adequate service available to meet the 
needs of the proposed site. Underground service is preferred.
    (c) Gas service. Gas distribution facilities, if provided, will be 
installed according to local requirements where adequate and dependable 
gas service is available.
    (d) Other utilities. Other utilities, if available, will be 
installed according to local requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.108  Grading and drainage.

    (a) General. Soil and geologic conditions must be suitable for the 
type of construction proposed. In questionable or unsurveyed areas, the 
applicant or developer will provide an engineering report with 
supporting data sufficient to identify all pertinent subsurface 
conditions which could adversely affect the structure and show proposed 
solutions. Grading will promote drainage of surface water away from 
buildings and foundations, minimize earth settlement and erosion, and 
assure that drainage from adjacent properties onto the development or 
from the development to adjacent properties does not create a health 
hazard or other undesirable conditions. Grading and drainage will comply 
with exhibit B, paragraphs III and IV, of this subpart.
    (b) Cuts and fills. Development requiring extensive earthwork, cuts 
and fills of 4 feet or more shall be designed by a professional 
engineer. Where topography requires fills or extensive earthwork that 
must support structures and building foundations, these must be 
controlled fills designed, supervised, and tested by a qualified soils 
engineer.
    (c) Slope protection. All slopes must be protected from erosion by 
planting or other means. Slopes may require temporary cover if exposed 
for long periods during construction.
    (d) Storm water systems. The design of storm water systems must 
consider convenience and property protection both at the individual site 
level and the drainage basin level. Storm water systems should be 
compatible with the natural features of the site. In areas with 
inadequate drainage systems, permanent or temporary storm water storage 
shall be an integral part of the overall development plan. Design of 
these facilities shall consider safety, appearance, and economical 
maintenance operations.

Sec. 1924.115  Single Family Housing site evaluation.

    (a) Site review. The site approval official will evaluate each site 
(developed or undeveloped) to determine acceptance for the program. 
Information on the site will be provided by the appraiser or site 
approval official on a form provided by RHS and available in any RHS 
field office.
    (b) Site access. Each site must be contiguous to and have direct 
access from:
    (1) A hard surfaced or all weather road which is developed in full 
compliance with public body requirements, is dedicated for public use, 
and is being maintained by a public body or a home owners association 
that has demonstrated its ability or can clearly demonstrate its ability 
to maintain the street; or
    (2) An all weather extended driveway which can serve no more than 
two sites connecting to a hard surface or all weather street or road 
that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1); or
    (3) A hard surfaced street in a condominium or townhouse complex 
which:
    (i) Is owned in common by the members or a member association and is 
maintained by a member association that has demonstrated its ability or 
can clearly demonstrate its ability to maintain the street; and

[[Page 170]]

    (ii) Connects to a publicly owned and dedicated street or road.
    (c) Exceptions to street requirements. A site not meeting the 
conditions in paragraph (b) of this section will be acceptable if:
    (1) The applicant is a builder for a conditional commitment (a loan 
will not be approved until the site meets the conditions in paragraph 
(b) of this section), or the builder posts an irrevocable performance 
and payment bond (or similar acceptable assurance) that assures the site 
approval official that the site will be developed to meet the conditions 
in paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (2) The site is recommended by the site approval official and 
approved by the state director. A request for state director approval 
must justify that it is in the best interest of both the government and 
the applicant to approve the site.
    (d) Site layout. (1) Sites shall be surveyed and platted. Permanent 
markers shall be placed at all corners.
    (2) Sites shall meet all requirements of state and local entities 
and RHS.
    (e) Covenants, conditions and restrictions. Sites in subdivisions 
shall be protected by covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) to 
preserve the character, value, and amenities of the residential 
community and to avoid or mitigate potential environmental impacts 
unless, an exception is granted by RHS after considering the suitability 
of local ordinances, zoning, and other land use controls.
    (1) CC&Rs shall be recorded in the public land records and 
specifically referenced in each deed.
    (2) The intent of the CC&Rs is to assure the developers that the 
purchasers will use the land in conformance with the planned objectives 
for the community. In addition, the CC&Rs should assure the purchasers 
that the land covered by the CC&Rs will be used as planned and that 
other purchasers will use and maintain the land as planned to prevent 
changes in the character of the neighborhood that would adversely impact 
values or create a nuisance.

      Exhibit B to Subpart C--Site Development Design Requirements

    This exhibit prescribes site development requirements to be used in 
developing residential sites in all housing programs. These requirements 
cover only those areas which involve health and safety concerns. They 
are not intended to cover all aspects of site development. Applicants 
and developers are expected to follow local practice, as a minimum, in 
all areas of site development not addressed in this exhibit. When State, 
local, or other requirements are applicable in addition to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354's requirements, the most 
stringent requirement shall apply.
    Proper integration of the natural features of a site with the 
manmade improvements is one of the most critical aspects of residential 
development. Poor site planning in large scale subdivisions, rental 
projects and individual sites, has resulted in a loss of valuable 
private and public natural resources and caused economic burdens and 
conditions unsuitable for healthy and pleasant living. Proper site 
design can preserve desirable natural features of the site, minimize 
expenses for streets and utilities, and provide a safe and pleasant 
living environment.

                              IV. Drainage

    A. General--1. Collection and Disposal. Surface and subsurface 
drainage systems shall be provided, as appropriate, for collection and 
disposal of storm drainage and subsurface water. These systems shall 
provide for the safety and convenience of occupants. They shall protect 
dwellings, other improvements and useable lot areas from water damage, 
flooding, and erosion.
    2. Concentrated Flow. Where storm drainage flow is concentrated, 
permanently maintained facilities shall be provided to prevent 
significant erosion and other damage or flooding on site or on adjacent 
properties.
    B. Drainage Design and Flood Hazard Exposure--1. Storm Frequency. 
Drainage facilities shall be designed for a 10 year storm frequency of 
24-hour duration. Full potential development of all contributing areas 
shall be used as a basis for this determination.
    2. Street Drainage. Streets shall be useable during runoff 
equivalent to a 10-year return frequency. Where drainage outfall is 
inadequate to prevent runoff equivalent to a 10-year return frequency 
from ponding over 6 inches deep, streets shall be made passable for 
local commonly used emergency vehicles during runoff equivalent to a 25-
year return frequency except where an alternative access street not 
subject to such ponding is available.
    3. Foundation Drainage. Appropriate crawl space and foundation 
drainage shall be provided for the removal of subsurface moisture.
    C. Primary Storm Sewer--1. Pipe Size. Pipe size for the primary 
storm sewer (any storm sewer or inlet lateral located in a street or 
other public right-of-way) shall have an inside diameter based on design 
analysis but not less than 15 inches. Where anticipated runoff from the 
five-year return frequency rainfall will not fill a 15 inch pipe, a 
primary storm sewer system usually is unnecessary.
    2. Minimum Gradient. Minimum gradient shall be selected to provide 
for self-scouring of the conduit under low-flow conditions and for 
removal of sediments foreseeable from the drainage area.
    3. Easements. Easements for storm sewers shall be a minimum of 10 
feet in width.
    D. Drainage Swals and Gutters--1. Design. Paved gutters shall have a 
minimum grade of 0.5 percent. Paved gutters and unpaved drainage swales 
shall have adequate depth and width to accommodate the maximum 
foreseeable runoff without overflow. Swales and gutters shall be seeded, 
sodded, sprigged or paved as appropriate to minimize potential erosion. 
Side slopes shall be no steeper than 2:1.
    2. Easements. Surface channels shall have an easement which is at 
least the width of the channel plus 10 feet.
    E. Downspouts--1. Outfall. Where downspouts are provided, they shall 
either be connected to an available storm sewer, provided with suitable 
splash blocks, or empty at acceptable locations onto paved areas so that 
water drains away from buildings. Downspouts shall not connect to 
sanitary sewers.
    2. Piped Drainage. Piped roof drainage from buildings shall be 
connected to available storm sewers or empty at locations where no 
erosion or other damage will be caused.
    F. Storm Inlets and Catch Basins--1. Openings. Where inlets are 
accessible to small children, openings shall have one dimension limited 
to 6 inch access. Inlet openings in paved areas shall be designed to 
avoid entrapment or impedence of bicycles, baby carriages, etc.
    2. Access. Access for cleaning shall be provided to all inlet boxes 
and catch basins.
    G. Drywells--Drywells for the disposal of water from foundation 
drains, crawl spaces, and other small quantity sources shall be 
permissible where the bottom of drywells project into strata of 
undistributed porous soil at a level where the bottom of the drywell 
will be above the ground water table at its highest seasonal elevation.

[[Page 175]]

                         V. Water Supply Systems

    A. Individual Water Systems--1. General. a. In this subpart, an 
individual water system is a system which serves fewer customers or 
connections than the lower threshold for community systems stated in the 
Safe Drinking Water Act.
    b. The system for an individual household should be capable of 
delivering a sustained flow of 5 gpm. A system supplying water to 
multiple household shall be designed by a Professional Engineer and have 
sufficient capacity to serve estimated demand. A test of at least 4 
hours duration shall be conducted to determine the yield and maximum 
drawdown for all wells developed as part of an individual water system. 
This test may be waived by the State Office based on the hydrologic and 
geologic conditions in the area.
    c. Water that requires continual or repetitive treatment to be safe 
bacterially is not acceptable.
    d. After installation, the system should be disinfected in 
accordance with the recommendations of the health authority. In the 
absence of a health authority, system cleaning and disinfection should 
conform with the current EPA Manual of Individual Water Supply Systems.
    e. Any method for individual water supply contained herein which is 
not permitted by the local health authority having jurisdiction shall 
not be used.
    2. Well Location-- a. A well located within the foundation walls of 
a dwelling is not acceptable except in arctic and sub-arctic regions.
    b. Water which comes from soil formation which may be polluted or 
contaminated or is fissured or creviced or which is less than 20 feet 
below the natural ground surface (subject to the requirements of the 
local health authority) is not acceptable.
    c. Individual water supply systems are not acceptable for individual 
lots in areas where chemical soil poisoning is practiced if the 
overburden of soil between the ground surface and the water bearing 
strata is coarse-grained sand, gravel, or porous rock, or is creviced in 
a manner which will permit the recharge water to carry the toxicants 
into the zone of saturation.
    d. Table 5 shall be used in establishing the minimum acceptable 
distances between wells and sources of pollution located on either the 
same or adjoining lots. These distances may be increased by either the 
health authority having jurisdiction or the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 State Director.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes:
\1\ The horizontal distance between the sewage absorption system and the
  well, or the chemically poisoned soil and the well, may be reduced to
  50 feet only where the ground surface is effectively separated from
  the water bearing formation by an extensive, continuous impervious
  strata of clay, hard-pan, or rock. The well shall be constructed so as
  to prevent the entrance of surface water and contaminants.
\2\ Other sources of pollution could be fuel oil or gasoline storage
  tanks, farm yards or chemical storage tanks, etc. The well should be
  separated from these sources of pollution a distance recommended by
  the local health authority.

    3. Well Construction-- a. The well shall be constructed to allow the 
pump to be easily placed and to function properly.
    b. All drilled wells shall be provided with a sound, durable and 
watertight casing capable of sustaining the loads imposed. The casing 
shall extend from a point several feet below the water level at drawdown 
or from an impervious strata above the water level, to 12 inches above 
either the ground surface or the pump room floor. The casing shall be 
sealed at the upper opening.
    c. Bored wells shall be lined with concrete, vitrified clay, or 
equivalent materials.
    d. The space between the casing or liner and the wall of the well 
hole shall be sealed with cement grout.
    e. The well casing shall not be used to convey water except under 
positive pressure. A separate drop pipe shall be used for suction line.
    f. When sand or silt is encountered in the water-bearing formation, 
the well shall either be gravel packed, or a removable strainer or 
screen shall be installed.
    g. The surface of the ground above and around the well shall be 
graded to drain surface water away from the well.
    h. Openings in the casing, cap, or concrete cover for the entrance 
of pipes, pump or manholes, shall be made watertight.
    i. If a breather is provided, it shall extend above the highest 
level to which surface water may rise. The breather shall be watertight, 
and the open end shall be screened and positioned to prevent entry of 
dust, insects and foregin objects.

[[Page 176]]

    4. Pumps and Equipment-- a. Pumps shall be capable of delivering the 
volume of water required herein under normal operating pressures within 
the living unit. Well pump capacity shall not exceed the output of the 
well.
    b. Pumps and equipment shall be mounted to be free of objectionable 
noises, vibrations, flooding, pollution, and freezing.
    c. Suction lines shall terminate below maximum drawdown of the water 
level in the well.
    d. Horizontal segments of suction line shall be placed below the 
frost line in a sealed casing pipe or in at least 4 inches of concrete. 
The distance from suction line to sources of pollution shall be not less 
than shown in table 5.
    5. Storage Tanks-- a. A system for an individual household shall 
include a pressure tank having a minimum capacity of 42-gallons. 
However, prepressured tanks and other pressurizing devices are 
acceptable provided that delivery between pump cycles equals or exceeds 
that of a 42 gallon tank. Storage capacity on a system for multiple 
households must be sufficient to meet estimated peak demands.
    b. Tanks shall be equipped with a clean-out plug at the lowest 
point, and if pressurized, a suitable pressure relief valve.
    c. When additional storage is necessary because the well yield will 
not meet the system peak demands, all nonpressurized intermediate tanks 
shall be designed and installed in a manner that will prevent the 
pollution or degradation of the water supply.
    B. Community Water Systems--1. Definition. In this subpart, a 
community water system is a system which meets the definition in the 
Safe Drinking Water Act.
    2. Design. A community water system shall be designed by a 
qualified, professional engineer licensed in the state in which the 
water system will be located. Community water systems shall comply with 
all Federal and State laws.

                     VI. Wastewater Disposal Systems

    Each dwelling shall be provided with a water-carried system adequate 
to dispose of domestic wastes in a manner which will not create a 
nuisance, contaminate any existing or prospective water source or water 
supply, or in any way endanger the public health.
    A. Individual Wastewater Disposal Systems--1. General. a. In this 
subpart, an individual wastewater disposal system is a sewage disposal 
system which serves only 1 dwelling unit.
    b. When service from an acceptable public or community system is not 
available or feasible, and ground water and soil conditions are 
acceptable, an individual system may be used.
    c. Each individual wastewater disposal system shall consist of a 
house sewer, a pretreatment unit (e.g., septic tank, individual package 
treatment plant), and acceptable absorption system (subsurface 
absorption field, seepage pit(s), or subsurface absorption bed). The 
system shall be designed to receive all sanitary sewage (bathrooms, 
kitchen and laundry) from the dwelling, but not footing or roof 
drainage. It shall be designed so that gases generated anywhere in the 
system can easily flow back to the building sewer stack.
    2. Percolation Tests-- a. Percolation tests are required unless a 
waiver is granted by the National Office. Waivers may be granted on a 
statewide or local basis in cases where an onsite evaluation of soils 
would be performed by a qualified soil technician, soil scientist, or 
engineer. Requests for waivers must describe the qualifications of the 
person evaluating the soils and discuss the criteria to be used in 
designing the absorption system.
    b. In uniform soils one percolation test shall be made within each 
area proposed for an absorption system. If significant soil variations 
are encountered or expected, additional tests shall be made for each 
variation.
    c. Percolation tests shall be conducted in accordance with good 
practice. Guidance for performing these tests is included in the EPA 
design manual, ``Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems.''
    3. Subsurface Absorption System-- a. Where percolation rates, soil 
characteristics and site conditions are acceptable, an absorption system 
may be installed in an area which is well drained, has an acceptable 
slope, and is acceptable for excavation.
    b. Soils with percolation rates less than 1 minute per inch may be 
used if the soil is replaced with a layer of loamy or fine sand at least 
2 feet thick. (Refer to the EPA Design Manual, ``Onsite Wastewater 
Treatment and Disposal System''.)
    c. Soils with percolation rates greater than 60 minutes per inch are 
not acceptable for subsurface wastewater disposal systems.
    B. Community Wastewater Disposal Systems--1. Definition. In this 
subpart, a community wastewater disposal system is any wastewater 
disposal system which serves more than 1 dwelling unit.
    2. Design. A community wastewater disposal system shall be designed 
by a qualified, professional engineer licensed in the state in which the 
system will be located.

    This subpart contains policies and procedures for receiving and 
resolving complaints concerning the construction of dwellings and 
construction, installation and set-up of manufactured homes (herein 
called ``units''), financed by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA)or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, and for compensating 
borrowers for structural defects under section 509(c) of the Housing Act 
of 1949, as amended. Provisions of this subpart do not apply to 
dwellings financed with guaranteed section 502 loans.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.252  Policy.

    FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is responsible 
for receiving and resolving all complaints concerning the construction 
of dwellings and the construction, installation and set-up of units 
financed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 must determine whether 
defects are structural or non-structural. If the defect is structural 
and is covered by the builder's/dealer-contractor's (the ``contractor'') 
warranty, the contractor is expected to correct the defect. If the 
contractor cannot or will not correct the defect, the costs of 
correcting the defect may be paid by the Government, or the borrower may 
be compensated for correcting the defect, under the provisions of this 
subpart. If the defect is non-structural but is covered under the 
provisions of the contractor's warranty or independent home warranty, 
the contractor is still expected to correct the defect. FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will assist the borrower in 
obtaining assistance through the independent home warranty company's 
and/or manufacturer's complaint resolution process. However, if the 
contractor cannot or will not correct a non-structural defect covered 
under the provisions of the contractor's warranty, the Government will 
not pay the costs for correcting the defect, nor will the borrower be 
compensated for doing so.


<R05>

installation or set-up of a unit, or a related facility or a deficiency 
in the site or site development which directly and significantly reduces 
the useful life, habitability, or integrity of the dwelling or unit. The

Sec. 1924.258  Notification of borrowers.

    FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will notify by 
letter all borrowers who receive Section 502 RH financial assistance for 
a newly constructed dwelling or unit of the provisions of this subpart. 
Subsequent owners of eligible dwellings will also be notified in 
accordance with this section. Borrowers will be notified within 30 days 
after the loan is closed, or within 30 days after final inspection, 
whichever is later. This notification will contain information 
concerning time frames for filing claims under this subpart. FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will also notify and advise 
borrowers of the construction defects procedure at any time construction 
defects are apparent within the statutory time frame and favorable 
results cannot be obtained from the contractor. This notification will 
be documented in the borrower's case file.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.259  Handling dwelling construction complaints.

    This section describes the procedure for handling construction 
defect complaints.
    (a) Each borrower who complains about construction defects will be 
requested to make a written complaint using a format specified by FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (available in any FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). All known 
defects will be listed. An oral complaint may be accepted if making a 
written complaint will impose a hardship on the borrower. If an oral 
complaint is made, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
will notify the contractor on behalf of the borrower.
    (b) The borrower will be informed that if, after 30 calendar days, 
the defects have not been corrected or other satisfactory arrangements 
made by the contractor, the borrower should notify FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 using a format specified by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (c) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will 
advise the contractor in writing of the borrower's complaint, the time 
and date of planned inspection by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 personnel, and request that the contractor accompany 
the inspector and borrower on a joint inspection of the property in an 
attempt to resolve the complaint.
    (d) If, prior to the planned inspection, the contractor informs FmHA 
or its

[[Page 181]]

successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that the alleged defect(s) has 
been or will be corrected within 30 calendar days, FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 will notify the borrower.
    (e) If the case is not resolved as outlined in paragraph (d) of this 
section, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will:
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) Notify the borrower, contractor and manufacturer, if applicable, 
in writing of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's 
findings and who has been determined responsible for correcting the 
defect(s).
    (i) If the defects are determined to be covered under the 
contractor's warranty, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 will advise the contractor that the repairs must be completed 
within 30 calendar days or other time period agreed to by the borrower, 
the contractor, and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354.
    (ii) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will 
further advise the contractor and/or manufacturer that if the defect(s) 
are not corrected, the Government will consider compensating the 
borrower for the costs of correcting the defect(s). In such a case, the 
contractor and/or manufacturer may be liable for costs paid by the 
Government and may be subject to suspension and/or debarment pursuant to 
subpart M of part 1940 of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). Even if the 
manufacturer is determined to be solely responsible for the defect, the 
contractor will still be held liable for correction of the defect.
    (3) Should a contractor refuse to correct a defect after being 
officially requested in writing to do so, FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 will promptly institute formal suspension and 
debarment proceedings against the contractor (as a company and as 
individual(s)) in accordance with subpart M of part 1940 of this chapter 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office). The contractor's failure to reply to official correspondence or 
inability to correct a defect constitutes noncompliance.
    (4) If the contractor is willing to correct legitimate defects but 
the borrower refuses to permit this, FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 will document the facts in the borrower's case file. 
If the borrower chooses to file a claim for compensation for these 
defects, the circumstances of the borrower's refusal will be reviewed 
and may be sufficient grounds for disapproval of the claim.
    (f)-(h) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.260  Handling manufactured housing (unit) construction complaints.

    When a borrower who has purchased a manufactured home (or ``unit'') 
complains about construction defects, the borrower will be instructed to 
first contact the dealer-contractor from whom the unit was purchased. 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will assist the 
borrower in obtaining assistance through the dealer-contractor's and/or 
HUD's complaint resolution process. If the dealer-contractor cannot 
resolve the complaint, the borrower should contact the appropriate State 
Administrative Agency (SAA) or HUD. If the complaint resolution process 
does not result in the correction of the defect, the borrower's 
complaint will be handled in accordance with Sec. 1924.259 of this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.261  Handling complaints involving dwellings covered by an independent or insured home warranty plan.

    Borrowers with complaints about dwellings covered by an independent 
or insured home warranty plan will be instructed to first contact the 
warranty company and follow the complaint resolution process for that 
company, with the assistance of FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354, if needed. If the complaint is not resolved in this 
manner, it will be handled under Sec. 1924.259 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.262  Handling complaints involving dwellings constructed by the self-help method.

    When a borrower whose dwelling was constructed by the self-help 
method complains about construction defects,

[[Page 182]]

FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will determine 
whether the defect is the result of work performed by a contractor or 
work performed by the borrower under the guidance of the self-help 
group. Defects which are determined to be the responsibility of a 
contractor will be handled in accordance with Sec. 1924.259 of this 
subpart. Defects determined to be the result of work performed by the 
borrower are not eligible for compensation under this subpart.


<R05>
Secs. 1924.263-1924.264  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1924.265  Eligibility for compensation for construction defects.

equipment, or
    (ii) The dwelling or unit has not been built in substantial 
compliance with the approved drawings and specifications, or
    (iii) The dwelling or unit does not comply with the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 construction standards in 
effect at the time the loan was approved or the conditional commitment 
was issued, or
    (iv) The property does not meet code requirements.
    (2) The claim must be for one or more of the following:

defect; or
    (iv) To acquire title to property.
    (3) The dwelling or unit must be newly constructed as defined in 
Sec. 1924.253 of this subpart and financed with an insured Section 502 
RH loan.
    (4) The claim seeking compensation from FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 must be filed with FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 within 18 months after the date financial 
assistance is granted. Defects for which claims are filed beyond the 18-
month period must have been documented by FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 in the borrower's case file or on the form 
designated by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office), prior to expiration of the 18-month period. For loans made to 
construct a new dwelling or erect a new manufactured housing unit, 
financial assistance is granted on the date of final construction 
inspection and acceptance by the borrower and FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354. Claims must be submitted by completing 
the designated form (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 office).

a contractor's warranty must have expired, or the contractor is 
responsible for making corrections under the contractor's warranty but 
is unable or unwilling to do so.
    (b) Subsequent owners of eligible dwellings or units who are also 
Section 502 borrowers may be eligible to receive compensation for 
construction defects. These owners will be notified in accordance with 
Sec. 1924.258 of this subpart. However, the claim for compensation must 
be filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section within the 
18-month period established for the original rural housing (RH) 
borrower.


<R05>
Sec. 1924.266  Purposes for which claims may be approved.

    (a) Eligible purposes. A claim may be approved to:
    (1) Pay, or reimburse the borrower for costs already paid, to repair 
major structural defects which are completed in accordance with plans 
and specifications approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354. Repairs must be made by a reputable licensed contractor and 
a warranty covering the repairs will be issued by the contractor when 
the repairs are completed, as prescribed in subpart A of this part. 
Payment will be based on actual cost of the development and the borrower 
must provide

[[Page 183]]

evidence to reasonably establish the development cost. Workmanship and 
materials used in repairs must be consistent with the level of quality 
specified in the original dwelling or unit specifications and/or 
comparable to the items being replaced. Payment may be made:
    (i) To cover damages which are a direct result of the defect to 
permanent enhancements made, such as landscaping, completion of 
unfinished living spaces, etc., of the dwelling or unit, installation or 
set-up of the unit, or related facilities, and
    (ii) For costs approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 for professional reports by engineers, architects or others 
needed to determine cause of or means to repair the defect.
    (2) Reimburse the borrower for funds expended for emergency repairs. 
Emergency repairs are those repairs necessary to preserve the integrity 
of the structure, to prevent damage or further damage to personal 
property or fixtures in the dwelling or unit and related facilities, or 
to prevent or eliminate immediate health hazards. Receipts or other 
evidence of borrower's expenditures must be provided.
    (3) Acquire title to the property by the Government and, when 
appropriate, compensate the claimant for any loss of borrower 
contribution at the time the loan was closed. Conveyance of properties 
under this section will be handled in accordance with subpart A of part 
1955 of this chapter.
    (i) Before FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
accepts a conveyance, the borrower must attempt to sell the dwelling or 
unit in accordance with subpart C of part 1965 of this chapter, if the 
dwelling or unit is considered decent, safe and sanitary as prescribed 
in subpart C of part 1955 of this chapter. If the property is sold, FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will:
    (A) Pay the borrower's relocation expenses, including temporary 
living expenses as prescribed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, until 
another suitable property can be located;
    (B) Pay related sales expenses, as prescribed in subpart C of part 
1965 of this chapter, if the property is sold for less than the debt 
against it;
    (C) Release the borrower from personal liability for the remaining 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 debt; and
    (D) Process an application for a new RH loan if the borrower so 
desires and is still eligible for FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 assistance.
    (ii) If the dwelling or unit is not considered decent, safe and 
sanitary as prescribed in subpart C of part 1955 of this chapter, FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 should accept a 
voluntary conveyance of the property under the provisions of subpart A 
of part 1955 of this chapter. Compensation for properties taken into 
inventory under this paragraph may not exceed the difference between the 
present market value of the security as established by the appraisal 
when the loan was made and the amount of the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 loan and any prior liens.
    (iii) A borrower contribution which may be compensated for under 
this paragraph may be such things as:
    (A) A borrower's land or cash contribution,
    (B) Development work done by the borrower under the self-help 
program or borrower method of construction, the cost of which was not 
included in the loan funds,
    (C) Attorney fees, abstract costs or title insurance costs actually 
paid by the claimant in connection with closing the loan.
    (4) Pay or reimburse the borrower for temporary living expenses, 
miscellaneous expenses, storage of household goods and moving expenses 
incurred as a result of the defect.
    (i) Payment under this paragraph may be made under either of the 
following circumstances:
    (A) The property is acquired by the Government in accordance with 
subpart A of part 1955 of this chapter and FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 determines that the dwelling is not habitable 
and the severity of the defect(s) prevents the property from being 
repaired and made

[[Page 184]]

suitable as a permanent residence for the borrower.
    (B) The property is not acquired by the Government but FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determines that the dwelling 
is not habitable or must be vacated in order to repair the defects.
    (ii) Claims for compensation under paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
are limited as follows:
    (A) Compensation may be granted for temporary living expenses for 
not more than 45 calendar days per claim unless a longer period is 
authorized by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. 
Compensation will be paid for actual cost to the claimant not to exceed 
the Government per diem rate for the area where the borrower's dwelling 
or unit is located. Reimbursement may be claimed for expenses such as 
food, lodging, laundering, etc., which would not have been incurred had 
the claimant remained in the house.
    (B) Compensation may be granted for actual miscellaneous expenses 
not to exceed $500 to cover such items as utility connect and disconnect 
fees.
    (C) Compensation may be granted for moving and storage expenses not 
to exceed $5,000 unless authorized by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 and not to exceed the actual cost of moving the 
claimant household with personal belongings a distance of not more than 
50 miles from the original residence. Compensation for storage expenses 
may not exceed that amount paid to store household furnishings for 45 
days.
    (D) A strict accounting of the use of such funds must be maintained 
by the borrower and will be verified by FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354.
    (5) Compensate the claimant for reasonable interest paid on loans 
obtained for the sole purpose of correcting structural defects or other 
approved purposes under this section.
    (b) Ineligible purposes. Compensation will not be granted for:
    (1) Completion of a dwelling or unit or installation of materials/
items required under the construction contract and/or specifications.
    (2) Defective items which were not completed under the contract 
method or under the conditional commitment and supported by a builder's 
warranty. Work performed under the borrower method or self-help program 
without a warranty by a responsible party is not eligible for 
compensation.
    (3) Damage caused by defective design, workmanship, or material in 
making enhancements to or remodeling the dwelling or unit or related 
facilities which were not financed or approved by FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (4) The loss of past, present or future wages or salary directly or 
indirectly resulting from the defect.
    (5) Treatment for physical or psychological damages including 
medical and dental claims.
    (6) Death benefits or funeral expenses.
    (7) Damages encountered as a result of war, civil disorder, flood,

<R05>
Sec. 1925.3  Servicing taxes.

    (a) The County Supervisor will be responsible for ascertaining that 
all mortgaged real estate is listed properly for tax purposes.
    (b) The County Supervisor will be responsible for taking all actions 
in connection with taxes as may be necessary to protect the Government's 
security interests. Any unusual situations that may arise with respect 
to tax servicing should be referred to the State Office for 
consideration.
    (c) The County Supervisor will encourage each borrower to pay taxes 
promptly in order to avoid any penalties. Normally, this can be 
accomplished through routine servicing of loans by emphasizing the 
advantages of setting aside sufficient income to meet tax obligations 
when they become due. Taxes will be adequately budgeted for those 
borrowers with whom Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 431-2, ``Farm and Home Plan,'' is developed. Each borrower will 
be encouraged to notify the County Supervisor when he has paid his 
taxes. After the delinquent date, it will be necessary for the County 
Supervisor to determine the borrowers whose taxes are delinquent. Forms 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1905-1, 
``Management System Card-Individual,'' FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1905-5, ``Management System Card- Individual 
(Rural Housing Only),'' and FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1905-10, ``Management System Card-Association,'' will be 
used in posting servicing action on delinquent taxes.


<R05>
Sec. 1925.4  Servicing delinquent taxes.

    (a) The County Supervisor will contact each borrower with a 
delinquent tax and make every practical effort to have him pay the tax 
with his own funds. He will use the Management System Card for follow-up 
of delinquent taxes. If the delinquent tax is not paid and the borrower 
comes to the office with proceeds for application on the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 account secured by the real 
estate, the County Office personnel will endeavor to get the borrower to 
use the proceeds to pay the delinquent tax. If the amount of the 
delinquent tax is less than the amount of the proposed payment, the 
difference will be applied on the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 account in accordance with the policy outlined in 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instructions 1951-
A and 1951-G.
    (b) Prior (usually about 90 days) to the time it is legally possible 
for action to be taken that will cause the borrower to lose title or 
right of possessions of the security property or the use of essential 
water, the County Supervisor will contact the borrower and definitely 
determine if he will pay the delinquent tax immediately. If the borrower 
is unable or unwilling to pay the delinquent tax with his own funds 
after every appropriate effort has been made to have him do so, the 
County Supervisor will refer to FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2024-A and utilize the Type 60 Purchase 
Order System to pay the amount of the delinquent taxes plus the amount 
of any accrued penalty to bring taxes current.
    (1) In an exceptional case where reasons for delinquent taxes have 
been removed and planned income during the next year covers payment of 
current obligations plus delinquent taxes not vouchered, only the 
delinquent taxes will be paid that could cause the borrower to lose 
title or right of possession of security property.
    (2) If the Government is holding a mortgage other than a first 
mortgage

[[Page 187]]

on the property, do not initiate payment request until the County 
Supervisor has determined that (i) the prior lien holder will not pay 
the delinquent tax, (ii) the Government's security will be jeopardized 
if the delinquent tax is not paid, and (iii) the value of the security 
is sufficient to justify the advance.

Sec. 1927.53  Costs of title clearance and closing of transactions.

    The borrower or the seller, or both, in compliance with the terms of 
the sales contract or option will be responsible for payment of all 
costs of title clearance and closing of the transaction and will arrange 
for payment before the transaction is closed. These costs will include 
any costs of abstracts of title, land surveys, attorney's fees, owner's 
and lender's policies of title insurance, obtaining curative material, 
notary fees, documentary stamps, recording costs, tax monitoring 
service, and other expenses necessary to complete the transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 1927.54  Requirements for closing agents.

    (a) Form of title certification. State Offices are directed to 
require title insurance for all loan closings unless the agency 
determines that the use of title insurance is not available or is 
economically not feasible for the type of loan involved or the area of 
the state where the loan will be closed. If title insurance is used, 
State Offices are authorized to require a closing protection letter 
issued by an approved title insurance company to cover the closing 
agent, if available. A closing protection letter need not be furnished 
when the closing is conducted by the title insurance company.
    (b) Approval of closing agent. An attorney or title company may act 
as a closing agent and close agency real estate

[[Page 190]]

loans, provide necessary title clearance, and perform such other duties 
as required in this subpart. A closing agent will be responsible for 
closing agency loans and disbursing both agency loan funds and funds 
provided by the borrower in connection with the agency loan so as to 
obtain title and security position as required by the agency. The 
closing agent must be covered by a fidelity bond which will protect the 
agency unless a closing protection letter is provided to the agency. The 
borrower will select the approved closing agent. If title clearance is 
by an attorney's opinion, the agency will approve the attorney who will 
perform the closing in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. 
The attorney will be approved after submitting a certification 
acceptable to the agency. If title certification is by means of a policy 
of title insurance, the title company which will issue the policy must 
have been approved in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. A 
closing agent's delay in providing services without justification in 
connection with agency loans may be a basis for not approving the 
closing agent in future cases.
    (c) Approval of attorneys. Any attorney selected by an applicant, 
who will be providing title clearance where the certificate of title 
will be an attorney's opinion, must submit an agency form certifying to 
professional liability insurance coverage. If the attorney is also the 
closing agent, fidelity coverage for the attorney and any employee 
having access to the funds must be provided. The agency will determine 
the appropriate level of such insurance. Required insurance will, as a 
minimum, cover the amount of the loan to be closed. The agency will 
approve the form stipulating the bond coverage. The agency will approve 
any attorney who is duly licensed to practice law in the state where the 
real estate security is located and who complies with the bonding and 
insurance requirements in this section. If the certification of title 
will be by means of title insurance, any attorney or closing agent 
designated as an approved attorney or closing agent by the approved 
title insurance company which will issue the policy of title insurance 
will be acceptable, and when covered by a closing protection letter, 
will not be required to obtain professional liability insurance or a 
fidelity bond. Each approved title insurance company may provide a 
master list of their approved attorneys that are covered by its closing 
protection letters to the State Office and, in such cases the attorneys 
are approved for closings for that title insurance company. Delay in 
providing closing services without justification may be a basis for not 
approving the attorney in future cases.
    (d) Approval of title companies. A title company acting as a closing 
agent, or as an issuing agent for a title insurance company, must be 
covered by a title insurance company closing protection letter or submit 
an agency form certifying to fidelity coverage to cover all employees 
having access to the loan funds. The agency will determine the 
appropriate level of such coverage and will approve the form stipulating 
the bond coverage. Delay in providing closing services without 
justification may be a basis for not approving the company in future 
cases. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list 
of their approved title companies that are covered by its closing 
protection letter to the State Office and, in such cases the title 
companies on the list are approved for closings for that title insurance 
company.
    (e) Approval of title insurance companies. The agency will approve 
any title insurance company which issues policies of title insurance in 
the State where the security property is located if:
    (1) The form of the owner's and lender's policies of title insurance 
(including required endorsements) to be used in closing agency loans are 
acceptable to the agency, and will contain only standard types of 
exceptions and exclusions approved in advance by the agency;
    (2) The title insurance company is licensed to do business in the 
state (if a license is required); and
    (3) The title insurance company is regulated by a State Insurance 
Commission, or similar regulator, or if not, the title insurance company 
submits copies of audited financial statements, or other approved 
financial statements

[[Page 191]]

satisfactory to the agency, which show that the company has the 
financial ability to cover losses arising out of its activities as a 
title insurance company and under any closing protection letters issued 
by the title insurance company.
    (4) Delay in providing services without justification may be a basis 
for not approving the company.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) Conflict of interest. A closing agent who has, or whose spouse, 
children, or business associates have, a financial interest in the real 
estate which will secure the agency debt shall not be involved in the 
title clearance or loan closing process. Financial interest includes 
having either an equity, creditor, or debtor interest in any 
corporation, trust, or partnership with a financial interest in the real 
estate which will secure the agency debt.
    (h) Debarment or suspension. No attorney, title company, title 
insurance company, or closing agent, currently debarred or suspended 
from participating in Federal programs, may participate in any aspect of 
the agency loan closing and title clearance process.
    (i) Special provisions. Closing agents are responsible for having 
current knowledge of the requirements of State law in connection with 
loan closing and title clearance and should advise the agency of any 
changes in State law which necessitate changes in the agency's State 
mortgage forms and State Supplements.
    (j) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1927.55  Title clearance services.

    (a) Responsibilities of closing agents. Services to be provided to 
the agency and the borrower by a closing agent in connection with the 
transaction vary depending on whether a title insurance policy or title 
opinion is being furnished. The closing agent is expected to perform 
these services without unnecessary delay.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Ordering title services. Application for title examination or 
insurance will be made by the borrower to a title company or attorney. 
The lender's policy will be for at least the amount of the loan. The 
United States of America will be named as the insured lender.
    (d) Use of title opinion. If a title opinion will be issued, a title 
examination will include searches of all relevant land title and other 
records, so as to express an opinion as to the title of the property and 
the steps necessary to obtain the appropriate title and security 
position to issue a title opinion as required by this subpart. The 
closing agent or approved attorney will determine:
    (1) The legal description and all owners of the real property;
    (2) Whether there are any exceptions affecting the property and 
advise the approval official and borrower of the nature and effect of 
outstanding interests or exceptions, prior sales of part of the 
property, judgments, or interests to assist in determining which 
exceptions must be corrected in order for the borrowers to obtain good 
and marketable title of record in accordance with prevailing title 
examination standards, and for the agency to obtain a valid lien of the 
required priority;
    (3) Whether there are outstanding Federal, State, or local tax 
claims (including taxes which under State law may become a lien superior 
to a previously attaching mortgage lien) or homeowner's association 
assessment liens;
    (4) Whether outstanding judgments of record, bankruptcy, insolvency, 
divorce, or probate proceedings involving any part of the property, 
whether already owned by the borrower, or to be acquired by assumption 
or with loan funds, or involving the borrower or the seller exist;
    (5) If a water right is to be included in the security for the loan, 
and if so, the full legal description of the water right;
    (6) In addition to paragraph(d)(2) of this section, if wetlands 
easements or other conservation easements have been placed on the 
property;
    (7) What measures are required for preparing, obtaining, or 
approving curative material, conveyances, and security instruments, and
    (8) That sufficient copies of these interests and exceptions are 
provided as requested by the approval official.

[[Page 192]]

    (e) Use of title insurance. When title insurance is to be obtained, 
the approval official will be furnished with a title insurance binder 
disclosing any defects in, exceptions to, and encumbrances against, the 
title, the conditions to be met to make the title insurable and in the 
condition required by the agency, and the curative or other actions to 
be taken before closing of the transaction. The binder must include a 
commitment to issue a lender policy in an amount at least equal the 
amount of the loan, except in instances where there may be an 
outstanding owner's policy in favor of the borrower. Not withstanding 
the provisions of this section, the instance of an assumption without a 
subsequent loan, the existing policy may be continued if the coverage 
meets or exceeds the assumption balance and the title company agrees in 
writing to extend coverage in full force and effect.
    (f) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1927.56  Scheduling loan closing.

    The agency, in coordination with the closing agent, will arrange a 
loan closing and send loan closing instructions, on an agency form to 
the closing agent when the agency determines that the exceptions shown 
on the preliminary title opinion or title insurance binder will not 
adversely affect the suitability, security value, or successful 
operation of the property and all other agency conditions to closing 
have been satisfied.


<R05>
Sec. 1927.57  Preparation of closing documents.

    (a) Preparation of deeds. The closing agent, unless prohibited by 
law, will prepare, complete, or approve documents, including deeds, 
necessary for title clearance and closing of the transaction and provide 
the agency with the policy of title insurance or title opinion providing 
the lien priority required by the agency and subject only to exceptions 
approved by the agency. Agency forms will be used when required by this 
part.
    (1)-(2) [Reserved]
    (b) Preparation of mortgages. The closing agent will insure that all 
mortgages are properly prepared, completed, executed, and filed for 
record. Where applicable, the mortgages should recite that it is a 
purchase money mortgage. The following requirements will be observed in 
preparing agency morgages:
    (1)-(8) [Reserved]
    (9) Alteration of mortgage form. An agency mortgage form may be 
altered pursuant to a State Supplement having prior approval of the 
National Office, or in a special case, to comply with the terms of loan 
approval prescribed in accordance with program instructions. No other 
alterations in the printed mortgage forms will be made without prior 
approval of the National Office. Any changes made by deletion, 
substitution, or addition (excluding filling in blanks) will be 
initialed in the margin by all persons signing the mortgage.
    (10) [Reserved]
    (11) Mortgages on leasehold estates. When the agency security 
interest is a leasehold estate, unless State law or State Supplement 
otherwise provides, the real estate mortgage or deed of trust form, 
available in any agency office, will be modified as follows:
    (i) In the space provided on the mortgage for the description of the 
real property security, the leasehold estate and the land covered by the 
lease must be described. The following language must be used unless 
modified by a State Supplement:

    All of borrower's right, title, and interest in and to a leasehold 
estate for an original term of ____ years, commencing on ______, 19 
____, created and established by and between ______ as lessor and owner 
and ____ as lessee, including any extensions and renewals thereof, a 
copy of which lease was recorded or filed in book ____, page ____, as 
instrument number ____, in the Office of the (e.g., County Clerk), for 
the aforesaid county and State and covering the following real property: 
______.

    (ii) Immediately preceding the covenant starting with the words 
``should default,'' the following covenant will be added:

    (  ) Borrower covenants and agrees to pay when due all rents and any 
and all other charges required by said lease, to comply with all other 
requirements of said lease, and not to surrender or relinquish, without 
the Government's prior written consent, any of borrower's right, title, 
or interest in or to said leasehold estate or under said lease while 
this mortgage remains of record.


[[Page 193]]


    (12) Mortgages on land purchase contract. When the agency security 
interest is on a borrower's interest in a land purchase contract, OGC 
will provide language used to modify agency forms.
    (13) [Reserved]
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Preparation of protective instruments. The closing agent will 
properly prepare, complete, and approve releases and curative documents 
necessary for title clearance and closing, in recordable form and record 
them if required.
    (1) Prior lienholder's agreement. If any liens (other than agency 
liens or tax liens to local governmental authorities) or security 
agreements (hereafter called ``liens''), with priority over the agency 
mortgage will remain against the real property securing the loan, the 
lienholders must execute, in recordable form, agreements containing all 
of the following provisions unless prior approval for different 
provisions has been obtained from the National Office:
    (i) The prior lienholder shall agree not to declare the lien in 
default or accelerate the indebtedness secured by the prior lien for a 
specific period of time after notice to the agency. The agreement must:
    (A) Provide that the specified period of time will not commence 
until the lienholder gives written notice of the borrower's default and 
the prior lienholder's intention to accelerate the indebtedness to the 
agency office servicing the loan,
    (B) Include the address of the agency servicing office,
    (C) Give the agency the option to cure any monetary default by 
paying the amount of the borrower's delinquent payments to the prior 
lienholder, or pay the obligation in full and have the lien assigned to 
the agency, and
    (D) Provide that the prior lienholder will not declare the lien in 
default for any nonmonetary reason if the agency commences liquidation 
proceedings against the property and thereafter acquires the property.
    (ii) When the prior lien secures future advances, including the 
lienholder's costs for borrower liquidation or bankruptcy, which under 
State law have priority over the mortgage being taken (or an agency 
mortgage already held), the prior lienholder shall agree not to make 
advances for purposes other than taxes, insurance or payments on other 
prior liens without written consent of the agency.
    (iii) The prior lienholder shall consent to the agency making (or 
transferring) the loan and taking (or retaining) the related mortgage if 
the prior lien instrument prohibits a loan or mortgage (or transfer) 
without the prior lienholder's consent.
    (iv) The prior lienholder shall consent to the agency transferring 
the property subject to the prior lien after the agency has obtained 
title to the property either by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance if 
the prior lien instrument prohibits such transfer without the prior 
lienholder's consent.
    (2)-(3) [Reserved]
    (4) Agreement by holder of seller's interest under land purchase 
contract. If the buyer's interest in the security property is that of a 
buyer under a land purchase contract, it will be necessary for the 
seller to execute, in recordable form, an agreement containing all of 
the following provisions:
    (i) The seller shall agree not to sell or voluntarily transfer the 
seller's interest under the land purchase contract without the prior 
written consent of the State Office.
    (ii) The seller shall agree not to encumber or cause any liens to be 
levied against the property.
    (iii) The seller shall agree not to commence or take any action to 
accelerate, forfeit, or foreclose the buyer's interest in the security 
property until a specified period of time after notifying the State 
Office of intent to do so. This period of time will be 90 days unless a 
State Supplement provides otherwise. The agreement shall give the agency 
the option to cure any monetary default by paying the amount of the 
buyer's delinquent payments to the seller, or paying the seller in full 
and having the contract assigned to the agency.
    (iv) The seller shall consent to the agency making the loan and 
taking a security interest in the borrower's interest under the land 
purchase contract as security for the agency loan.
    (v) The seller shall agree not to take any actions to foreclose or 
forfeit the

[[Page 194]]

interest of the buyer under the land purchase contract because the 
agency has acquired the buyer's interest under the land purchase 
contract by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance, or because the agency 
has subsequently sold or assigned the buyer's interest to a third party 
who will assume the buyer's obligations under the land purchase 
contract.
    (vi) When the agency acquires a buyer's interest under a land 
purchase contract by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, the 
agency will not be deemed to have assumed any of the buyer's obligations 
under the contract, provided that the failure of the agency to perform 
any such obligations while it holds the buyer's interest is a ground to 
commence an action to terminate the land purchase contract.

1927.58  Closing the transaction.

    The closing agent will cooperate with the approval official, 
borrower, seller, and other necessary parties to arrange the time and 
place of closing. The transaction may be closed when the agency 
determines that the agency requirements for the loan have been satisfied 
and the closing agent or approved attorney can issue or cause to be 
issued a policy of title insurance or final title opinion as of the date 
of closing showing title vested as required by the agency, the lien of 
the agency's mortgage in the priority required by the agency, and title 
to the mortgaged property subject only to those exceptions approved in 
writing by the agency. The loan will be considered closed when the 
mortgage is filed for record and the required lien is obtained.
    (a) Disbursement of loan funds. When the closing agent indicates 
that the conditions necessary to close the loan have been met, loan 
funds will be forwarded to the closing agent. Loan funds will not be 
disbursed prior to filing of the mortgage for record; however, when 
necessary, loan funds may be placed in escrow before the mortgage is 
filed for record and disbursed after it is filed. No development funds 
will be kept in escrow by the closing agent after loan closing, unless 
approved by the agency. Loan funds for the payment of a lien may be 
disbursed only upon the recording of a discharge, satisfaction, or 
release of prior lien interests (or assignment where necessary to 
protect the interests of the agency).
    (b) Title examination and liens or claims against borrowers. If 
there are exceptions or recorded items which have arisen since the 
preliminary title opinion, the transaction will not be closed until 
these entries have been cleared of record or approved by the agency. The 
closing agent will advise the approval official of the nature of such 
intervening instruments and the effect they may have on obtaining a 
valid mortgage of the priority required or the title insurance policy to 
be issued.
    (c) Taxes and assessments. The closing agent will determine if all 
taxes and assessments against the property which are due and payable are 
paid at or before the time of loan closing. If the seller and the 
borrower have agreed to prorate any taxes or assessments which are not 
yet due and payable for the year in which the closing of the transaction 
takes place, the seller's proportionate share of the taxes and 
assessments will be deducted from the proceeds to be paid to seller at 
closing and will be added to the amount required to be paid by borrower 
at closing. Appropriate prorations as agreed upon between the borrower 
and seller may also be made for taxes paid by the seller which are 
applicable to a period after the closing date, and for common area 
maintenance fees, prepaid rentals, insurance (unless the borrower is to 
obtain a new policy of insurance), and growing crops.
    (d) Affidavit regarding work of improvement.--(1) Execution by 
borrower. If required by State Supplement, the closing agent will 
require that an affidavit regarding work of improvement, provided by the 
agency, be completed and executed when a loan is being made to a 
borrower who already owns the real estate to be mortgaged. This 
affidavit will be executed by the borrower at closing.
    (2) Execution by seller. If required by State Supplement, the 
closing agent will require that an affidavit regarding work of 
improvement, provided by the agency, be completed and executed 
(including acknowledgment) by the seller

[[Page 195]]

when the agency is making a loan to a borrower to enable the borrower to 
acquire the property (including transfers). This affidavit will be 
executed by the seller at closing.
    (3) Legal insufficiency of affidavit form. If the agency affidavit 
regarding work of improvement is not legally sufficient in a particular 
State, a State form approved by OGC will be used. A similar form that 
may be required by a title insurance company may be substituted for the 
agency form.
    (4) Recording. The affidavit will not be recorded unless the closing 
agent deems it necessary and State law permits.
    (5) Delay in closing. The loan will not be closed if, at the loan 
closing, the seller (in a sale transaction) or the borrower (in a 
nonpurchase money loan situation) indicates that construction, repair, 
or remodeling has been commenced or completed on the property, or 
related materials or services have been delivered to or performed on the 
property within the time limit specified in the affidavit, unless a 
State Supplement provides otherwise. The closing agent will notify the 
approval official, who will determine if the work of improvement could 
result in a lien prior to the agency lien. The State Office will, with 
the advice and concurrence of OGC, provide in a State Supplement the 
period of time to be used in completing the affidavit.
    (e)-(f) [Reserved]
    (g) Return of loan documents to approval official after loan 
closing. Within 1 day after loan closing, the closing agent will return 
completed and executed copies of the loan closing instructions, the 
executed original promissory note, and all other documents required for 
loan closing (except the mortgage), to the approval official. If the 
recorded mortgage is customarily returned to the borrower or closing 
agent after recording, then it must be forwarded to the approval 
official immediately.
    (h) Final title opinion or title insurance policy. As soon as 
possible after the transaction has been closed.
    (1) Final title opinion. The attorney will issue a final title 
opinion to the agency and the borrower on a form provided by the agency. 
Issuance of the final title opinion should not be held up pending the 
return of recorded instruments. If it is not possible for the final 
title opinion to show the book and page of recording of the agency 
security instrument, the words ``and is recorded'' in the final title 
opinion form provided by the agency office, may be deleted and the blank 
space completed to show the filing office and the filing instrument 
number, if available. Attached to the final title opinion will be 
required documents then available, including any which the approval 
official has furnished to the attorney which were not previously 
returned. The attorney will ensure that all recorded instruments are 
forwarded or delivered to the proper parties after recording. The 
certification of title will be forwarded for a voluntary conveyance.
    (2) Title insurance policy. The closing agent will send or deliver 
the title insurance policy, with the United States listed as mortgage 
holder, to the approval official. The policy will be subject only to 
standard exceptions and those outstanding encumbrances, and exceptions, 
approved by the approval official. If an owner's policy of title 
insurance is requested, the closing agent will send or deliver it to the 
borrower. The closing agent will ensure that all recorded instruments 
are delivered or sent to the proper parties after recording.
    (3) [Reserved]
    (i) Other services of the closing agent. (1) The closing agent will 
assist the approval official in preparing, completing, obtaining 
execution and acknowledgment, and recording the required documents when 
necessary. The closing agent will keep the approval official advised as 
to the progress of title clearance and preparation of material for 
closing the transaction.
    (2) The closing agent will provide services for deeds in lieu of 
foreclosure as set forth in Sec. 1927.62 of this subpart, and 
Sec. 1955.10 of subpart A of part 1955 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1927.59  Subsequent loans and transfers with assumptions.

    Title services and closing for subsequent loans to an existing 
borrower

[[Page 196]]

will be done in accordance with previous instructions in this subpart, 
except that:
    (a) Loans closed using title insurance or title opinions. (1) Title 
insurance or title opinions will be obtained unless:
    (i) The cost of title services is excessive in relationship to the 
size of the loan,
    (ii) The agency currently has a first mortgage security interest,
    (iii) The applicant has sufficient income to service the additional 
loan,
    (iv) The borrower is current on the existing agency loan, and
    (v) The best mortgage obtainable adequately protects the agency 
security interests.
    (2) Title insurance or a final title opinion will not be obtained 
for a subsequent Section 504 loan where the previous Section 504 loan 
was unsecured or secured for less than $7,500 and the outstanding debt 
amount plus the new loan is less than $7,500.
    (3) Loans closed using a new lender title insurance policy:
    (i) Will cover the entire real property which is to secure the loan, 
including the real property already owned and any additional real 
property being acquired by the borrower with the loan proceeds.
    (ii) Will cover the entire amount of any subsequent loan plus the 
amount of any existing loan being refinanced (if the existing loan is 
not being refinanced, the new lender policy will insure only the amount 
of the subsequent loan).
    (b) Title services required in connection with assumptions. These 
regulations are contained in part 1965, subparts A, B, and C, of this 
chapter as appropriate for the loan type.

describes the scope of property management needed to maintain program 
objectives. When the management is from other than the borrower, a 
management agreement will be used to define the responsibilities of the 
management agent. Initial, modified and/or replacement management 
agreements will be approved by authorized FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 officials. A sample management agreement is 
provided in exhibit B-3 of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 1930.109  Extent of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 supervision.

    The objective of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 supervision is to guide and advise borrowers and their designated 
representatives in their quest to meet MFH program objectives, goals, 
and obligations, not to direct the borrower's activity. Supervision does 
not relieve borrowers of their own responsibilities and obligations. 
Supervision starts with the first contact by the applicant and continues 
as long as any loan balance remains outstanding. In the case of a grant, 
supervision continues until the requirements of the grant agreement have 
been fulfilled. Supervision of borrowers is a primary responsibility of 
the Servicing Official; however, additional supervision and guidance 
will be given by the State Director and/or other appropriate members of 
the State Office staff. Security servicing actions will be handled 
according to subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter.


<R05>
Sec. 1930.110  Methods of supervision.

    Supervisory methods used by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 employees include organizational and development 
planning; property management planning; affirmative marketing; 
construction conferences; long-term, annual, and other

[[Page 201]]

periodic planning and evaluation; accounts, budgets, and records 
inspections and guidance; project inspections; attendance at membership 
and governing body meetings; periodic group meetings with borrowers; 
analysis of accounting, budgets, and audit reports; guidance by 
memorandums; and similar activities. Supervision of cooperative 
borrowers will include coordination with the adviser to the board. 
Supervision of grant-only recipients will consist of at least the 
reviews and inspections outlined in Sec. 1930.119 of this subpart.
    (a) Applicants. Prior to loan or grant closing, supervision will 
largely be conducted during conferences and meetings with prospective 
borrowers and their various representatives such as applicant's 
attorney, architect, property manager, etc. Examples of supervision 
include:
    (1) Organizational meetings to discuss needs, services available, 
owner obligations, and to establish organizational committees.
    (2) Preapplication and application conferences.
    (3) Preconstruction conferences to reach an understanding regarding 
responsibilities and the manner in which development will be performed. 
The applicant at this point should be made fully aware of the 
responsibilities detailed in Sec. 1930.103 of this subpart.
    (4) Preloan and/or grant closing conferences to review requirements 
of the loan resolution or agreement, closing requirements, and 
management plan and to establish responsibilities for the operation of 
the project. The applicant at this point should be made fully aware of 
the responsibilities entailed in Sec. 1930.103 of this subpart.
    (5) Preoccupancy conferences to review the management plan, 
marketing plan, and the general readiness of project facilities, 
recordkeeping systems, renting or occupancy procedures, and personnel 
assignments to begin project operation. This conference will be 
conducted according to Sec. 1944.235(h) of subpart E of part 1944 of 
this chapter.
    (b) Borrowers who have yet to demonstrate their ability and 
borrowers with problems. When the borrower is establishing its 
operations, or when borrowers are delinquent, or have other 
difficulties, supervisory guidance will include:
    (1) Implementation and/or review for compliance with the management 
plan.
    (2) Establishment and maintenance of a financial recordkeeping and 
reporting system.
    (3) Compliance with the requirements of the loan agreement or loan 
resolution.
    (4) Review of annual audit and budget requirements.
    (5) Any other supervision that may be necessary to assure effective 
and successful operation of the project.
    (6) A requirement that the borrower contract with a management firm 
with proven background and/or experience in property management. In the 
case of cooperative housing, this stipulation will apply only when it 
has been determined that the cooperative is unable to manage itself.
    (c) Borrowers who have demonstrated ability. Supervision will 
consist of at least an annual review of budgets and other management 
reports according to Sec. 1930.122, and a triennial supervisory visit 
according to Sec. 1930.119 of this subpart when the borrower is:
    (1) Successful in completing a first full fiscal year of operation.
    (2) Current with loan payments.
    (3) In compliance with other loan or grant requirements.
    (4) Maintaining the security in a satisfactory manner.
    (5) Otherwise progressing satisfactorily.

Sec. 1930.119  Supervisory visits, compliance reviews, and inspections.

    (a) Purpose. Servicing Officials and other FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 authorized persons will visit the MFH 
project site, including the management office, as necessary to 
accomplish the objectives of the loan or grant. Following are the major 
purposes for which visits may be made:
    (1) To assist with satisfactory development of the project.
    (2) To evaulate the management program of the project pursuant to 
exhibit B of this subpart, such as:
    (i) Adherence to the management plan.
    (ii) Compliance with the management agreement when applicable.
    (iii) To review compliance with the Affirmative Fair Housing 
Marketing Plan and/or the Equal Opportunity requirements of title VI of 
the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1968 as amended 
by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975.
    (3) To review borrower records and verify required compliance and 
information, such as:
    (i) Tenant or member eligibility.
    (ii) Tenant or member income.
    (iii) Tenant or member selection criteria.
    (iv) Waiting lists.
    (v) Rental or occupancy rates are in accordance with an FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approved budget.
    (vi) Other necessary items.
    (4) To inspect and ascertain proper maintenance and assure 
protection of the security for the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 loan.
    (5) To determine if the project is being operated according to the 
approved budget.
    (6) To determine that borrower and/or borrower's managment agent is

    (7) In the case of all LH borrowers, including on-farm LH, to 
determine that the housing is serving domestic farm laborers, as defined 
by paragraph II of exhibit B of this subpart, and that the LH housing 
provided is decent, safe, and sanitary.
    (b) Frequency and standards. Visits will be made as follows:

[[Page 204]]

    (1) Supervisory visits will be made as needed to assure compliance 
with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 policies and 
objectives. A Servicing staff person or other FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 authorized person will perform a post 
rent-up or occupancy visit before the end of the first 90 days of 
operation; and a thorough supervisory visit no later than 12 months 
following the post occupancy visit, and at least every 36 months 
thereafter at each project.
    (i) More frequent visits to delinquent or problem projects, 
irrespective of loan type, should be scheduled as needed.
    (ii) In the case of borrowers with on-farm LH unit(s) or LH 
borrowers providing seasonal farm labor housing, such visits should be 
made during the season of occupancy and preferably during an annual farm 
visit.
    (iii) Planned visits will be included in the monthly work calendar.
    (iv) The visit shall be conducted with the borrower and/or the 
borrower's designated representative.
    (v) Exhibits F, F-1, F-2, G, G-1, and G-2 of this subpart should be 
used to assist in the preparation, completion, and followup of visits.
    (vi) For small rental projects consisting of only a few units 
(usually 1 to 3), the degree of completion of exhibits F, G, G-1 and G-2 
may be minimized. Supervisory visits to such projects are required only 
once every three years and should concentrate on tenant eligibility, 
income and adjustments to income verification, maintenance, insurance 
coverage, and status of loan payments.
    (2) The Servicing Official or other FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 authorized person will conduct an inspection of 
each project at least once every 36 months with the borrower, site 
manager, or designated representative present.
    (i) This inspection may be made simultaneously with a supervisory 
visit scheduled in accordance with this section.
    (ii) The results of the inspection will be documented on HUD Form 
9822, ``Report of Physical Condition and Estimate of Repair Costs,'' or 
a similar form for the same purpose may be used for this inspection.
    (iii) Based on the Servicing person's knowledge, without further 
research, the estimated repair need and cost columns of the form will be 
completed during the inspection visit.
    (c) Preparation. The person planning to make the visit and 
inspection will review the most recent quarterly or annual reports, the 
running records, correspondence, and other Servicing Office records to 
be fully aware of the supervisory needs of the project. This awareness 
should be developed into an informal visit plan and include, but not be 
limited to such things as; payment status, subsidy status, due dates of 
taxes and insurance, adequacy of fidelity coverage, and any known 
maintenance problems.
    (d) Notice of visit or inspection. The management agent, or when 
applicable, the owner should receive a written notice of the scheduled 
visit or inspection from the Servicing Office 30 days before the event 
to insure that needed records and staff are available (see Guide Letter 
1930-2 for borrower notification.)
    (e) Conducting visit or inspection. The person making the visit or 
inspection should spend sufficient time at the project to accomplish the 
visit plan and any additional needs that are observed or brought out by 
the tenants, members, or management staff.
    (f) Recording, reporting and followup. The preparation notes and 
results of each visit should be recorded on exhibits F, G, G-1 and G-2 
of this subpart and filed in the borrower's servicing file. A letter 
highlighting any needed followup actions and a copy of the completed 
supervisory visit checklist will be directed to the management agent 
and/or the borrower within 30 days after the visit. Followup will 
continue through resolution of any problems. Any major problems with the 
project will be reported in writing to the State Director with 
recommendations for corrective action. Exhibit A to subpart A of part 
1955 of this chapter or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1955-2, ``Report on Real Estate Problem Case,'' may be used 
as appropriate.

[[Page 205]]

    (g) Compliance reviews. As authorized State or Servicing staff 
member or other FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
authorized person will complete the Civil Rights and Fair Housing review 
requirements according to subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter. If 
initial rent-up or occupancy has not occurred by the time of initial 
review, a subsequent review will be due one year following initial 
occupancy and then every 36 months thereafter or in accordance with 
subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter.

Secs. 1930.120-1930.121  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1930.122  Borrower accounting methods, management reporting and audits.

    It is the objective of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 that borrowers will maintain accounts and records necessary to 
conduct their operation successfully and from which they may accurately 
report operational results to FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 for review, and otherwise comply with the terms of their 
loan agreements with the Agency. Borrower accounts and records will be 
kept or made available in a location within reasonable access for 
inspection, review, and copying by representatives of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or other agencies of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture authorized by the Department.
    (a) Accounting methods and records--(1) Method of accounting and 
financial statements. Borrowers may choose a cash or accrual method of 
accounting, bookkeeping, and budget preparation as described in their 
project management plan, unless otherwise specified in a work-out plan 
as part of a servicing action. Balance sheets or statements of financial 
condition may be prepared reflecting the same accounting method, except 
that the accrual method of reporting financial condition will be used 
where the borrower is required to submit an annual audit.
    (2) Approval requirement. Before loan closing or start of 
construction, whichever is first, each borrower shall incorporate a 
description of its method of accounting, bookkeeping, budget 
preparation, and reporting of financial condition and, when applicable, 
plans for auditing, in the project management plan that must be approved 
by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (3) Records. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1930-5, ``Bookkeeping System-Small Borrower,'' may be used by small 
organizations as a method of recording and maintaining accounting 
transactions. Automated systems may be used if they meet the conditions 
of paragraph XVI of exhibit B of this subpart.
    (4) Record retention. Each borrower shall retain all financial 
records, books, and supporting material for 3 years after the issuance 
of the audit reports and financial statements. Upon request, this 
material will be made available to FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354, the OIG, the Comptroller General, or to their 
representatives.
    (b) Management reports and review processes. The objective of 
management reports and review processes is to furnish the management and 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with a means of 
evaluating prior decisions and to serve as a basis for planning future 
operations and financial conditions. Timely reports and their review 
furnish necessary information to make sound management decisions. All 
reports will relate only to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 financed project and borrower entity. Separate 
reports will be prepared and submitted for each project owned by the 
same borrower. Forms necessary in making the required reports may be 
requested from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. 
The various review processes described in this paragraph are illustrated 
at Sec. 1930.123(i) of this chapter.
    (1) Annual budget and utility allowance--(i) Objective. It is the 
objective of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that 
project budgets and/or utility allowances be prepared, reviewed, and 
approved in such manner and timing that the approved budget and/or 
utility allowance, including any authorized changes to same, become 
effective on the beginning of a fiscal year of project operation.

[[Page 206]]

    (ii) Documents. (A) The annual project budget will be prepared on 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7, 
``Multiple Family Housing Project Budget,'' by the borrower or its agent 
following the instructions on the form. It will reflect budget planning 
for a 12 month fiscal year. Figures in the ``actual'' column will 
reflect at least 9 months of actual fiscal year activity and no more 
than 3 months of estimated activity for the balance of the same fiscal 
year based on recent actual experience.
    (B) When tenants pay their own utilities, the housing allowance for 
utilities and other public services will be prepared on exhibit A-6 to 
subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. Exhibit A-6 will be prepared by 
the borrower or its agent following instructions attached to the exhibit 
and will be submitted to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 together with Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-7 with justification to either retain or change the utility 
allowance.
    (iii) Supporting data. Any data, justification, or other 
documentation required by the instructions for preparation of Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 and exhibit A-6 
to subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter, or otherwise required by the 
Servicing Official on an individual case basis, shall be ttached to the 
respective document when submitted to the Servicing Office.
    (iv) Due date. The borrower can submit the necessary documents as 
soon as 9 months of current fiscal year actuals are available, but in 
sufficient time to meet the objective stated in (b)(1)(i) of this 
section. The Servicing Official needs 15 to 30 days to review project 
budgets and utility allowances when no changes of rents, occupancy 
charges, or utility allowances are needed. When such changes are needed, 
the borrower needs to submit documents to allow sufficient time for 
review and proper notice of change to tenants or members.
    (v) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review. 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 and 
exhibit A-6 to subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and any attachment 
will be reviewed by the Servicing Office as part of the rental or 
occupancy charge/utility allowance change review and/or annual review 
process.
    (2) Rental or occupancy charge budget and/or utility allowance 
change--(i) Objective. It is the objective of FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 that changes to project rental or 
occupancy charges and/or utility allowances be incorporated into the 
annual budget review and planning process in such manner and timing that 
authorized changes become effective at the beginning of a fiscal year of 
project operation.
    (ii) Documents. When a rental or occupancy charge and/or utility 
allowance change is proposed, the borrower or its agent will prepare and 
submit Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 
and exhibit A-6 to subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and any 
supporting attachments following the instructions for either document.
    (iii) Standards and timing. (A) The policies and procedures 
governing rental or occupancy charge and/or utility allowance change are 
contained in exhibit C of this subpart, (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office or the ``Borrower 
Handbook'' made up of selected exhibits of this subpart and parts of 
this chapter).
    (B) To meet the projected effective date of change, the necessary 
documents need to be received by the Servicing Official at least 75 days 
ahead of the effective date of change to allow FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 review to authorize a 60 day notice to 
tenants or members of an impending change. The ``actual'' column of Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 shall 
contain actual data for the fiscal year to date plus the projection of 
expected data for the remainder of the fiscal year. This projection 
should cover a period not exceeding 90 days. The same supporting data 
standards of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section will apply.
    (C) Should the borrower need to request a rental or occupancy charge 
and/or utility allowance change at

[[Page 207]]

some time other than described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this 
section, e.g., mid-fiscal year, Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-7 shall reflect the project's financial needs 
for the next 12 months of operation and the ``actual'' column shall 
reflect the most recent 12 months of actual data. The previous fiscal 
year's audit report, or Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1930-8, ``Multiple Family Housing Borrower Balance Sheet,'' 
as appropriate, shall be submitted with the change request if it was not 
previously submitted to the Servicing Office.
    (iv) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review. 
Exhibit C of this subpart shall govern FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 review of the borrower's request for rental or 
occupancy charge and/or utility allowance change.
    (3) Quarterly report--(i) Objective. The objective of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is for quarterly reports to 
provide a monitoring means for borrowers and FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 to mutually check a borrower's progress 
in achieving program objectives and when applicable, meeting servicing 
goals.
    (ii) Document. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-7 will be used by borrowers to prepare the quarterly 
report.
    (iii) Standards. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-7 will be completed following the instructions on the form 
for preparation of a quarterly report. The quarterly report shall be 
required upon commencement of any of the following situations:
    (A) Start up of initial occupancy after completion of new 
construction or substantial rehabilitation.
    (B) Reamortization, transfer of an existing project loan or a 100 
percent membership change.
    (C) Failure to make a scheduled loan payment, failure to maintain 
required transfers to the reserve account, or failure to maintain 
reserve accounts at authorized current levels.
    (D) Existence of reasons stated in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B) of this 
section when quarterly reports will suffice in place of monthly reports.
    (iv) Frequency and discontinuance--(A) Quarterly reports. Quarterly 
reports shall be prepared and submitted for each quarter year at least 
through the first year of operation for any situation described in 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and each quarter year thereafter 
for new or existing projects until discontinuance is authorized by the 
Servicing Official. The Official will evaluate the following in reaching 
a decision to discontinue:
    (1) An adequate accounting system is functioning properly, is kept 
current, and the most recent required annual financial reports are 
complete and have been submitted to the Servicing Office.
    (2) Project loan payments to FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 are on schedule.
    (3) The project reserve account is ahead or on schedule, allowing 
for authorized expenditures or authorized reduction in funding as set 
forth in an approved servicing plan or budget.
    (4) The annual review has been completed by the Servicing Office and 
the annual audit, or verification of review when appropriate, has been 
found acceptable.
    (5) The Servicing Official has inspected the project, reviewed 
project operations, and found them acceptable. When this and the 
preceding determinations are made, a letter of discontinuance of the 
quarterly report shall be sent to the borrower or its agent with a copy 
sent to the State Director.
    (B) Monthly reports. Preparation and submission of the reports 
described in this paragraph may be required monthly at the option of the 
Servicing Official, rather than quarterly, when warranted in unusual 
situations.
    (1) This requirement may be invoked when determined essential by the 
Servicing Official as part of a servicing plan made in accordance with 
exhibit F of subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter (available in any 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (2) Reasons for invoking the reporting requirement on a monthly

may include, but not be limited to, factors such as apparent violations 
of policy or reporting practices, audit findings, sudden increases of 
vacancy and/or accounts payable or receivables, or other evidence of 
weak financial condition.
    (v) Due date. Quarterly (or monthly) reports shall be due in the 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Office 
by the 20th day of the month immediately following the close of the 
respective reporting period.
    (vi) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review. 
(A) The Servicing Official will review the reports for year-to-date 
status of project operations. When reports reveal actual data that 
exceeds acceptable tolerance from a forecasted budget SUBTOTAL item, or 
vacancies and accounts receivable and/or payable are increasing, the 
Servicing Official will initiate verbal and/or written dialogue with the 
borrower for further resolution of problems or to otherwise achieve 
acceptable progress.
    (B) The Servicing Official will complete the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 review and forward the borrower's report 
and any related documentation to the State Director by the 30th day of 
the month following close of the reporting period.
    (C) If the borrower fails to submit its report by the due date, this 
fact will be reported to the State Director by the 30th day of the month 
following the close of the reporting period: otherwise, the Servicing 
Office will complete its review of a submitted report no later than 10 
calendar days following receipt of the borrower's report.
    (4) Annual audit reports and verifications of review--(i) Documents 
and general standards--(A) Annual audit report. An audit report will be 
in the format as prepared by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or 
Licensed Public Accountant (LPA), provided the LPA was licensed on or 
before December 31, 1970.
    (1) All audits are to be performed in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards, as set forth in ``Government 
Auditing Standards'', established by the Comptroller General of the 
United States, and any subsequent revisions (this publication is 
commonly referred to as the ``Yellow Book'' or ``General Accounting 
Office Standards''). In addition, the audits are also to be performed in 
accordance with applicable portions of various Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) Circulars, Departmental Regulations, parts 3015 and 3016 of 
chapter XXX of title 7, and the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Audit Program as specified in separate sections of 
this subpart.
    (2) An audit report is required for any project with 25 or more 
units unless the State Director or Servicing Official determines that a 
project with 24 or fewer units requires an audit for reasons of good 
cause. Such reasons include, but are not limited to, situations where 
project records are incomplete or inaccurate, or it appears that the 
borrower has not adequately accounted for project funds, or where the 
borrower's operation consists of multiple projects where each project is 
24 or fewer units (with subsidiary reports prepared for each project).
    Note: The State Director or Servicing Official may require that the 
accounts of RHS borrowers be audited if the loan exceeds the 2-year 
repayment term.
    (3) The project audit report should cover the borrower entity and 
the expense for preparation of the audit report may include the 
auditor's preparation of any Internal Revenue Service (IRS) required 
borrower entity reports, i.e., Schedule K1 (IRS Form 1065), ``Partner's 
Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, etc.''.
    (4) The CPA or LPA auditor who prepares the audit report may not be 
an individual or organization that is associated with the borrower in 
any manner, other than the performance of the audit review and 
preparation of the project audit report and required IRS reports, that 
creates an identity of interest or possible conflict of interest (as 
described in paragraph V B of exhibit B of this subpart). For example, 
the CPA or LPA auditor may not be an employee of the borrower or an 
employee of any officer of the organization, nor be an employee of any 
member, stockholder, partner, principal, or have any ownership or other 
interest in the borrower organization.

[[Page 209]]

    (5) The State Director or Servicing Official may authorize the 
initial audit report to cover a period up to 18 months for new projects 
whose first operating year does not exceed 6 months.
    (6) The State Director may also make an exception to the CPA or LPA 
audit requirement for not more than one successive year in a specific 
case providing: The borrower submits a written request; the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approved budget for the 
project includes a typical and reasonable fee for the audit but the 
negotiated cost of an audit would increase the monthly per unit rental 
rate by more than $4.00; and the required reports, including a CPA or 
LPA prepared audit, were properly submitted for the prior year's project 
operations.
    (B) Verification of review. Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-8 will be prepared by a competent person 
qualified by education and/or experience who has no identity of interest 
or possible conflict of interest with the borrower or its principals. 
However, in the case of a nonprofit institution, the verification of 
review may be made by a committee of the membership but may not include 
any officer, director or employee of the borrower.
    (1) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-
8 will be used for the verification of review of project accounts and 
the review verifier will also review the actual data on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 for projects with 24 or 
fewer units unless the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A)(1) of this 
section are invoked by the State Director or Servicing Official.
    (2) The State Director or Servicing Official may authorize the 
initial verification of review to cover a period of up to 18 months for 
a new project whose first operating year was less than 6 months.
    (C) Project operating budget actuals. An annual report of actuals 
for the full operating year will be submitted by the borrower, or its 
agent, using Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1930-7. The report will reflect the actual income and expenses for the 
project for the borrower's 12 month operating year. The report will be 
submitted with the annual audit report or Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-8, as appropriate.
    (D) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-
10, ``Annual Multiple Family Housing Project Review.'' When the annual 
audit report or verification of review is received by the Servicing 
Office, parts II C and D of Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-10 may be prefilled to the extent possible to 
record previous year status as reported in the audit report or 
verification of review. The Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-10 will be completed later as described in 
Sec. 1930.123 (e)(2) and (i) of this subpart.
    (E) Fraud, abuse, and illegal acts. If the review verifier becomes 
aware of any indication of fraud, abuse or illegal acts in FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financed projects, prompt 
written notice shall be given to the appropriate USDA OIG Regional 
Inspector General and the Servicing Official.
    (ii) Specific standards--(A) State and local governments and Indian 
tribes. These organizations are to be audited in accordance with this 
subpart, subpart I of 7 CFR part 3015, and OMB Circular A-128, with 
copies of the audit being forwarded by the borrower to the Servicing 
Official and the appropriate Federal cognizant agency, if applicable. 
For guidance in meeting these requirements, the auditor may refer to the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting 
Guide for ``Audits of State and Local Governmental Units.'' The term 
``Federal financial assistance'' used herein shall mean Federal loan 
and/or grant funds received by the borrower, but not rental subsidies.
    (1) Cognizant agency. (i) ``Cognizant agency'' means the Federal 
agency assigned by OMB Circular A-128. Within USDA, the USDA OIG shall 
fulfill cognizant agency responsibilities.
    (ii) Cognizant agency assignments. Smaller borrowers not assigned a 
cognizant agency by OMB should contact the Federal agency that provided 
the most funds. When USDA is designated

[[Page 210]]

as the cognizant agency or when it has been determined by the borrower 
that FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 provided the 
major portion of Federal financial assistance, the appropriate USDA OIG 
Regional Inspector General shall be contacted.
    (2) Audit standards. It is not intended that audits required by this 
subpart be separate and apart from audits performed in accordance with 
State and local laws. To the extent feasible, the audit work should be 
done in conjunction with those audits.
    (i) State and local governments and Indian tribes that receive 
$100,000 or more a year in Federal financial assistance shall have an 
audit made in accordance with OMB Circular A-128.
    (ii) State and local governments and Indian tribes that receive 
between $25,000 and $100,000 a year in Federal financial assistance 
shall have an audit made in accordance with OMB Circular A-128 or in 
accordance with the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 Audit Program. This is an option of the State and local government 
or Indian tribe. If the election is made to have an audit performed in 
accordance with the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 Audit Program, the audit shall be in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (iii) State and local governments and Indian tribes that receive 
less than $25,000 a year in Federal financial assistance shall be exempt 
from compliance with OMB Circular A-128 and the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 Audit Program. These State and local 
governments and Indian tribes shall be governed by audit standards 
prescribed by State and local law or regulation.
    (iv) Public hospitals and public colleges and universities may be 
excluded from OMB Circular A-128 audit standards. If such entities are 
excluded, audits shall be made in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (v) Indications of fraud, abuse, and illegal acts shall be processed 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i)(E) of this section.
    (B) Nonprofit institutions. These organizations are to be audited in 
accordance with this subpart, subpart I of 7 CFR part 3015, and OMB 
Circular A-133, with copies of the audit being forwarded by the borrower 
to the Servicing Officer and the appropriate Federal cognizant agency, 
if applicable. The term Federal financial assistance used herein shall 
mean Federal loan and/or grant funds received by the borrower, but not 
rental subsidies.
    (1) Cognizant agency. See paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A)(1) of this 
section.
    (2) Audit standards. (i) Nonprofit institutions that receive 
$100,000 or more a year in Federal financial assistance shall have an 
audit made in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-133. 
However, nonprofit institutions receiving $100,000 or more but receiving 
awards under only one program have the option of having an audit of 
their institution prepared in accordance with the provisions of the 
Circular or having an audit made of the one program in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section. For prior or subsequent years, 
when an institution has only loan guarantees or outstanding loans that 
were made previously, the institution will be required to conduct audits 
for those programs in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this 
section.
    (ii) Nonprofit institutions that receive at least $25,000 but less 
than $100,000 a year in Federal financial assistance shall have an audit 
made in accordance with OMB Circular A-133 or in accordance with the 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Audit Program. If 
the election is made to have an audit performed in accordance with the 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Audit Program, the 
audit shall be performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of 
this section.
    (iii) Nonprofit institutions receiving less than $25,000 a year in 
Federal financial assistance are exempt from Federal audit standards, 
but records must be available for review by appropriate officials of 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (3) Indications of fraud, abuse and illegal acts shall be processed 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i)(E) of this section.

[[Page 211]]

    (C) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Audit 
Program. For-profit organizations and other entities referred to this 
paragraph by paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) and/or (B) of this section, audits 
will be performed under the guidance of the audit guide entitled ``U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354-Audit Program'' (available in any FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (iii) Due date. (A) Annual audit reports and verifications of 
review, as appropriate, and Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-7 with 12 months of project operation actuals 
are due in the Servicing Office no later than 90 days following the 
close of the project fiscal year.
    (B) If the audit or verification of review cannot be submitted by 
the due date, and the owner presents a request for extension supported 
by evidence that delay is at the request of the auditor, and the request 
has a reasonable explanation of why an extension of the due date is 
needed, the Servicing Officer may authorize up to a 30-day extension of 
the due date.
    (C) If an explanation is not forthcoming from the auditor, or the 
explanation received is without good reason, or the Servicing Official 
otherwise suspects fiscal difficulty, the Servicing Official may request 
the borrower to submit to the Servicing Office for review, the project 
bank statements for the general operating, reserve, and investment 
accounts covering the most recent 60 day period.
    (D) If the borrower fails to submit the requested bank statements by 
the date stipulated by the Servicing Official, the Servicing Official 
will immediately refer the matter to the OIG.
    (iv) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review. 
An audit report or verification of review will be reviewed by the 
Servicing Official within 60 days following receipt of the audit report 
or verification of review. From this annual audit review process, the 
Servicing Official will initiate action on findings and concerns needing 
immediate attention. Those findings and concerns not needing immediate 
action will be considered in the next budget planning and annual review 
process at the end of the fiscal year for implementation in the 
following fiscal year of project operation.
    (5) Miscellaneous management reports. These reports include, but are 
not limited to, the following items that provide additional or unique 
information that augment or otherwise support other management reports 
described in this section:
    (i) Documents and formats--(A) Minutes of annual meetings. Written 
record of annual meeting of organizational borrowers who, by their 
organizational charter, are required to maintain such written records.
    (B) Energy audit. Prepared according to the guidance of exhibit D of 
this subpart. Energy audits, including implementation plans for energy 
conservation, are prepared and submitted on 5-year cycles.
    (C) Miscellaneous items. These include other written or 
electronically stored data or information such as financial or income/
expense data, justification statements, or other technical or 
informative material that stands alone or supports other managements 
reports described in this section, whether volunteered by the borrower 
or requested by the Servicing Official.
    (ii) Due date. Annual minutes and miscellaneous items are due along 
with the report they are attached to as supporting documentation. New 
energy audits are due with the next submission of Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 following expiration of 
the old energy audit.
    (iii) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review. 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review of 
miscellaneous management reports will coincide with review of the 
management report that each is attached to as documentation.

<R05>
Sec. 1930.123  Annual review.

    (a) Objective. The objective of the annual review is for the FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official to 
determine the degree and adequacy of the borrower's achievement of 
operational compliance

[[Page 212]]

with the applicable FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 loan and/or grant agreements and to provide followup consultation or 
supervision to the borrower in meeting program objectives.
    (b) Annual review process. During the annual review process, the 
Servicing Official will consider the overall project financial and 
operational activity. Project strengths and weaknesses will be 
identified, based on review of various documents, and resultant 
conclusions will be incorporated into the annual budget planning process 
that should happen concurrently with the annual review process.
    (c) Documents used in the review. (1) Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7.
    (2) Exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter.
    (3) Prior fiscal year annual audit report as prepared by a CPA or 
LPA, or when applicable, Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1930-8 prepared by a review verifier accompanied by Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 with actual 
income and expense data.
    (4) Exhibit A-1 of this subpart prepared in conjunction with the 
prior year annual audit report.
    (5) Applicable attachments required as part of any of the above 
documents (or other information as volunteered by the borrower or 
specifically requested by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 Servicing Officer for the review at hand).
    (6) Minutes of annual meeting for association type borrowers.
    (7) Current energy audit with energy conservation implementation 
plan (from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
borrower casefile except when new energy audit is due with Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7).
    (8) Latest supervisory visit and physical inspection of property 
reports (from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
borrower casefile).
    (d) Preparation for the annual review. Some documents needed are 
available in the borrower's casefile and the balance needed will be 
submitted with the annual budget review request. Therefore, annual 
review should occur within 30 days of receipt of all necessary 
documents. This should result in annual reviews being completed in the 
last 2 months of a fiscal year or the first 2 months of the next fiscal 
year. When determined necessary, the Servicing Officer should:
    (1) Notify the borrower of the required management reports and their 
due dates, and provide the borrower with necessary guides and forms for 
use in preparing the reports.
    (2) With a new nonprofit borrower organization, determine that the 
borrower is properly planning for its annual meeting for the correct 
date according to its organizational documents. The Servicing Official 
should plan to attend the annual meeting unless the borrower has 
progressed as described in Sec. 1930.110(c) of this subpart.
    (e) Timing, conducting, and completing the review. (1) The annual 
review process will be scheduled and performed concurrently with the 
budget planning process, normally in the last quarter of a project 
fiscal year (see illustration in paragraph (i) of this section). This 
process will occur separately from the annual audit review process 
(which will occur following close of a project fiscal year).
    (2) The Servicing Official will use the applicable resource 
documents listed above when performing the review. The Servicing 
Official will conduct the annual review following the review and 
recording guidance of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-10. The Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-10 will be completed during the prescribed last quarter 
review period.
    (3) The Servicing Official may invite the borrower or its agent to 
participate in any part of the annual review.
    (f) Distribution of reviewed documents. (1) A copy of the results of 
the annual review on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-10 along with recommendations or compliance requirements 
will be sent to the borrower and/or its agent and to the State Director 
as soon as the review is completed.

[[Page 213]]

    (2) The individual items required to perform the annual review will 
be distributed according to appropriate FMI's as listed on exhibit B-7 
of this subpart.
    (g) State Director's review of annual reviews. Upon receipt of the 
items identified in this section, the State Director will:
    (1) Review all submissions of Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1930-10 that are used by the Servicing Official 
to record summary results of an annual project review.
    (2) Conduct a more detailed review of only those annual reviews that 
warrant further review. The State Director should provide summarized 
comment to Servicing Officials after completion of statewide review, 
otherwise the State Director will comment on any specific borrower and/
or project annual review selected for further review.
    (3) Will review Form 1930-7 and exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 
1944 for approval when the authority to approve budgets as part of the 
annual review is not delegated to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official.
    (4) Be prepared for a sample review of annual reviews by the 
National Office upon request during a combined assessment review or 
other specific need.
    (h) On-farm LH annual review. For individual farm borrowers with on-
farm LH unit(s), the objective of this section will be satisfied by 
completing the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of their farm 
and home planning with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 as outlined in subpart D of part 1944 of this chapter.

Sec. 1930.125  Changing project designation.

    Generally, RRH projects designated for families, elderly and persons 
with handicaps, including congregate housing, will be used for the 
original purpose throughout the life of the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 loan. However, if it becomes necessary to 
change the designation of a project due to housing market changes which 
inhibit the borrower's ability to maintain occupancy levels sufficient 
to sustain the project, the State Director may change the designation. 
Project design must meet the housing requirements of the target group 
when changing the designation. The State Director shall consider such 
requests on a case-by-case basis when all of the following information 
has been provided:
    (a) The complete borrower case files have been submitted together 
with the Servicing Official's specific recommendations and analysis of 
the present and long term situation.
    (b) A market needs survey which substantiates the rationale for the 
change has been provided by the borrower. (The market survey must 
clearly indicate the present long term marketability of the project is 
significantly changed from the original market, and include the 
appropriate demographic information which reflects the population trends 
in the area.)
    (c) A summary of all servicing actions taken by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to aid the borrower in 
maintaining the present designation.
    (d) A summary of all actions taken by the borrower to effectively 
market the units to potential eligible tenants.
    (e) A summary of the impact the change will have on any existing 
tenants, rent subsidy needs, and the community as a whole.
    (f) A summary of any needed or required physical modifications and 
analysis of cost feasibility to complete the modifications.

Sec. 1930.128  LH grants.

    In addition to the supervision provided in connection with LH loans, 
recipients of LH grants will receive supervision to assure that the 
terms of the grant agreement and other objectives of the LH grant are 
carried out. This supervision will be continued to assure that the grant 
purposes will be accomplished. Comments on the following points will be 
included in appropriate reports, to assure that:
    (a) The rents are reasonable.
    (b) The project is operated as a community service for the benefit 
of the tenants.
    (c) Domestic farm laborers are given absolute priority in occupancy. 
(This requirement also applies to borrowers who have LH loans only.)
    (d) No public or private nonprofit organization borrower may require 
that an occupant work for a particular farm or for a particular owner or 
interest as a condition of occupancy of the housing.

Sec. 1930.129  RHS loans.

    RHS loans will be serviced according to program regulations and the 
conditions specified in the borrower's loan resolution. The following 
additional supervisory action by the Servicing Official will also apply 
to assure that the terms of the loan resolution and loan objectives are 
carried out:
    (a) Review of the site development account records for compliance 
with authorized loan expenditures.
    (b) Work with the borrower on the adjustment of sales price, not to 
exceed market value, of the developed lots as they are being sold to 
assure adequate income to repay the loan, pay taxes, accrued interest, 
and any other authorized debt or expenditures.
    (c) Determine that lots are sold only to eligible buyers.
    (d) Work closely with the borrower to plan for the sale of all lots 
prior to the due date of the note.
    (e) Should the RHS borrower default in its loan obligations, the 
account will be serviced according to Sec. 1965.85 of subpart B of part 
1965 of this chapter. The Servicing Official's report to the State 
Director should contain the following information:
    (1) The status of the account, number of lots unsold, and reasons 
for the problem.
    (2) Prospects of selling lots to eligible buyers and a target date 
as to when this can be accomplished, if feasible.
    (3) General comments and recommendations for future servicing of 
this account. Where necessary, liquidation may be recommended.
    (f) State Directors will take the following actions in connection 
with problem RHS accounts:
    (1) Provide additional guidance and assistance as necessary.
    (2) If a satisfactory proposal for selling the lots can be 
developed, the account will be serviced according to program regulations 
and the provisions of this subpart and subpart B of part 1965 of this 
chapter.
    (3) Where no satisfactory proposal for selling the remaining lots 
can be developed, the account will be handled according to 
Sec. 1965.85(e) of subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter for 
liquidation.

the interest of the Government or adversely affect the accomplishment of 
the purposes of the MFH program or result in undue hardship by applying 
the requirement. The Administrator may exercise the authority at the 
request of the State Director or the Assistant Administrator for 
Housing. The request must be supported by data that demonstrates the 
adverse impact, citing the particular requirement involved and 
recommending proper alternative course(s) of action, and outlining how

management agent may not request an appeal unless he/she has been 
designated as the borrower's representative. This means he/she must be 
authorized in writing by the borrower to act for the borrower in the 
administrative appeal, as required by subpart B of part 1900 of this 
chapter (this may be addressed in the management agreement). The 
borrower's request for review of an alleged adverse decision must be

1930-10, ``Annual Multiple Family Housing Project Review.''

           Exhibit A-1 to Subpart C--Audit Report Review Guide

    I  Purpose. To present a general guide for use of Farmers Home 
Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
staffs in the review of independent accountants' audit reports in order 
to obtain maximum benefit from these audits. The procedures are designed 
to provide uniformity in the audit review, improve loan program 
servicing, and help to promote better independent audits.
    II  General. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
guidelines for independent auditors are detailed in the booklet, ``U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354--Audit Program'' (hereinafter called 
Audit Program and available in any FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 office). This Audit Program, along with other 
instructions, is designed to protect the security of Government loans. 
The review of the financial and financially related information in the 
audits must be performed from a technical standpoint in a prompt manner 
so that the facts and conclusions are readily available for analysis; 
only then can results be used effectively for management purposes and 
help to insure improved audit practices.
    III  Scope. The review should include:
    A  A determination of the adequacy of the audit in relation to FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations and the 
Audit Program.
    B  Interpretation of information included in the audit.
    C  Preparing a letter to the borrower on any missing or adverse 
audit data.
    D  Informing appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 offices of review results and recommendations.
    IV  Review Procedures to Be Followed.
    A  General. The individual professional judgment of the reviewer 
should be used at all times. Considerations and decisions requiring the 
exercise of judgment should be used in the following:
    1  Circumstances peculiar to the borrower.
    2  Degree of importance attached to each item questioned.
    3  Number of exceptions.
    4  Whether the exceptions relate to the auditor's work or the 
borrower's records and operations.
    5  If specific action is to be requested of the borrower.
    6  Whether or not the report, as a whole, is acceptable.
    B  Review and Procedure.
    1  Specific.
    a  Determine if the audit was performed by a Certified Public 
Accountant (CPA) or a Licensed Public Accountant (LPA) who was licensed 
on or before December 31, 1970.
    b  Determine if the audit was conducted in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards (1988 Revision), often referred to as 
generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).
    c  Does the audit cover the most recent 12 months since the previous 
audit?
    d  Was the audit received within 90 days after the borrower's year 
end, or was an extension of up to an additional 30 days authorized by 
the Servicing Official, and if so, was it met?
    2  Evaluation checklist for audit reports. The ``Evaluation 
Checklist for Audit Reports'' which is attachment 1 of this exhibit is 
designed to systematically record and reveal the audit findings. 
Information tallied on this form is a good indication of whether or not 
additional contact(s) need to be made with the borrower.
    3  Previous audits and correspondence. Reference to the prior audit 
and any correspondence concerning it can be most helpful in the current 
review. Determine whether corrections requested in the previous year 
have been made, and whether the borrower has complied with previous 
suggestions for improvement in the audit report.
    C  Preparing the audit review letter. After completion of the 
``Evaluation Checklist for Audit Reports'' (attachment 1 of this 
exhibit) and applying personal judgment, a decision must be made on 
whether or not to prepare an audit review letter similar to that shown 
as attachment 2 of this exhibit.
    1  If the audit fully complies with the Audit Program and 
instructions, a letter is not necessary.
    2  If the audit substantially meets the requirements and is lacking 
in only a few points, ask the borrower to have the auditor furnish this 
additional information.
    3  Audits which are unacceptable should be returned to the borrower 
for full compliance, indicating the reasons and a timetable for 
resubmitting.

      Exhibit B to Subpart C--Multiple Housing Management Handbook

    I  Purpose: This exhibit prescribes the Farmers Home Administration 
(FmHA) or

[[Page 221]]

its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations, policies, and 
procedures for management of Rural Rental Housing (RRH), Rural 
Cooperative Housing (RCH), and Labor Housing (LH) projects to be used by 
multiple housing borrowers (owners) and applicants and their management 
agents and site managers. Several exhibits are included to provide 
guidance. These regulations are intended to assist borrowers in the 
successful operation of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354-financed rental and cooperative projects.
    II  Definitions:
    Adjusted annual income. This is the annual income of the household 
members, who live or propose to live in the unit for the next 12 months. 
(Households with a member permanently confined to a hospital or nursing 
home may choose to either include annual income attributable to such 
person, less deductions for which the person would qualify, or exclude 
the annual income attributable to such person and not take any 
deductions for which the person would qualify.), excluding:
    1  $480 for each member of the family residing in the household 
(other than the tenant, cotenant, member, or comember or spouse of 
either, or foster children) who is under 18 years of age; or who is 18 
years of age or older and is disabled, handicapped or a full-time 
student. The student must carry a subject load considered full-time by 
the educational institution attended. This deduction does not apply to 
an unborn child in the household.
    2  $400 for any elderly family.
    3  In the case of an elderly family, the total of actual medical 
and/or handicap assistance expenses paid in excess of 3 percent of 
annual family income may be deducted. If an elderly family has both 
medical and handicap assistance expense, the 3 percent of annual income 
must first be deducted from handicap assistance and any remainder then 
deducted from medical expenses.
    a  Total medical expense includes medical expenses not covered by 
insurance that the tenant or member anticipates incurring over the 12 
months following the effective date of the certification, using past 
experience as a guide.
    b  Examples of medical expenses are dental expenses, prescription 
and nonprescription medicines, medical insurance premiums including 
medicare, eyeglasses, hearing aids and batteries, medical related travel 
cost, the cost of attendant care including a live-in-resident assistant, 
monthly payments required on accumulated major medical bills including 
that portion of a household member's nursing home care paid from 
household income(s).
    Note: Premiums paid for nursing home insurance are not an allowable 
deduction unless a household member is housed at a nursing home and that 
person's income is included in the household income.)
    c  Handicap assistance includes reasonable attendant care and 
auxiliary apparatus expenses described as follows for each member with 
handicaps of the family to the extent needed to enable any family member 
(including such member with handicaps) to be employed:
    (1) That portion of attendant care attributable to specialized 
medical reasons (the portion attributable to companionship is not 
counted).
    (2) Auxiliary apparatus including but not limited to wheelchairs, 
oxygen equipment, reading devices for the visually impaired, and the 
cost of equipment added to cars and vans to permit their use by the 
handicapped or disabled family member proportionate to the amount of use 
by such persons.
    4  In the case of any nonelderly family, total handicap assistance 
expense in excess of 3 percent of annual family income may be deducted:
    a  For any handicap assistance expense described in paragraph 3 c of 
this definition that is anticipated to occur over the 12 months 
following the effective date of the certification, using past experience 
as a guide, to the extent needed to enable any family member (including 
the handicapped or disabled family member) to be employed.
    b  The amount of deduction may not exceed the LESSER of the amount 
by which total expenses for handicap assistance exceed 3 percent of 
annual family income, or the amount of income received by adult members 
from such employment.
    5  The amounts paid by the family for the care of minors under 13 
years of age may be deducted only to the extent such expenses are not 
reimbursed. In the case of families assisted by American Indian housing 
authorities, the amount will be the greater of child care expenses; or 
excessive travel expenses, not to exceed $25 per family per week. 
Deductions for these expenses are permitted only when such care is 
necessary to enable a family member to further his or her education or 
to be gainfully employed, including the gainful employment of the 
disabled or handicapped family member. When the deduction is to enable 
gainful employment the amount may not exceed the amount of income 
received from such employment. When the deduction is to facilitate 
further education, the amount must not exceed a sum reasonably expected 
to cover class time and travel time to and from classes. The tenant file 
must contain justifying documentation. (Child support payments made on 
behalf of a minor child who does not reside in the unit may not be 
deducted as a child care expense).
    Adjusted monthly income. This is the amount obtained by dividing the 
adjusted annual income by 12.

[[Page 222]]

    Annual income. Annual income is the anticipated total amount of 
income to be received by all members of the household (even if 
temporarily absent) to be in residence during 12 months following the 
effective date of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1944-8, ``Tenant Certification.''
    1  Income Included. The following are included when determining 
annual income:
    a  The gross amount (before any deductions) of wages and salaries, 
overtime pay, commissions, fees, tips, and bonuses reasonably expected 
to be received by all members of the household.
    b  The net income reasonably expected to be received from operations 
of a business or profession or from rental of real or personal property. 
Expenditures for business expansion or amortization of indebtedness are 
not considered in the computation of net income. Net losses will be 
computed as zero. Deductions from gross business or rental income to 
arrive at net income may be made in the same manner as outlined in 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations for the exhaustion, wear and 
tear, and obsolescence of depreciable property used in the trade or 
business of the adult household members under the straight line method 
of depreciation. An itemized schedule must be provided in support of any 
deductions from gross income made under the provisions of this section. 
The schedule should be consistent with the amount of depreciation 
permitted for these items for Federal income tax purposes under the 
straight line method of depreciation.
    c  Interest, dividends, and other received income as defined under 
net family assets in this paragraph. On contracts for sale of real 
estate, deeds of trust, or mortgages held by the applicant, tenant or 
member, only the interest portion of the monthly or annual payments 
received by the applicant, tenant or member is included as income.
    d  The gross amount of periodic payments from Social Security 
(including Social Security payment received by adults on behalf of 
minors or by minors intended for their own support), annuities, 
insurance policies, retirement funds, pensions, disability or death 
benefits (except lump sum settlements), and other similar types of 
periodic receipts.
    e  Payments received in lieu of earnings, such as unemployment and 
disability compensation, worker compensation, and severance pay.
    f  Periodic and determinable allowances, such as alimony and child 
support payments, which the applicant, tenant or member can reasonably 
expect to receive.
    g  Regularly recurring contributions or gifts received from persons 
not residing in the dwelling.
    h  Any amount of education grants or scholarships or Veterans 
Administration benefits expected to be received on behalf of tenant, 
cotenant, member, or comember, applicant, or other adult that exceeds 
attendance expenses for tuition, fees, books, and equipment to include 
materials, supplies, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses 
of the student (i.e., that portion of benefits received for ``room and 
board'').
    i  All regular pay, separation pay, special pay (except hazard duty 
pay for persons exposed to hostile fire), and allowances of a member of 
the armed forces who is head of the family or spouse, whether or not 
that family member lives in the unit.
    j  Payment received from an adoption incentive program to compensate 
support of a minor child legally adopted by the tenant household.
    k  Public assistance.
    (1) A public assistance payment that DOES NOT designate an amount 
specifically for rent and utilities shall be counted entirely as income.
    (2) A public assistance payment, when administered ``as-paid'' by 
the public assistance agency, DOES designate a specific amount for rent 
and utilities and may adjust (or ratably reduce) that amount based upon 
what the family is currently paying for those items (only one ratable 
reduction will be permitted). The SUM of the ratably reduced amount for 
rent and utilities and the amount for subsistence and other needs shall 
be counted as income.
    (3) Example: The public agency's published schedule shows a monthly 
maximum of $180 for rent and utilities for a particular size family. The 
public assistance agency has verified that the family will receive $220 
monthly for subsistence and other needs. If the agency does not apply a 
ratable reduction, $400 per month ($180 + $220) will be included in 
annual income. If the agency applies a ratable reduction (e.g., 20 
percent) annual income will be computed as shown below:
      

------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Public assistance (P.A.) rent                   Income
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$180 maximum allowed for housing..........  $220 basic needs
                                            +144 P.A. rent
 x .80 P.A. adjustment factor.............  $364 mthly income
$144 monthly P.A. rent....................   x 12 months
                                            *$4,368 annual income
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  under Public Law 103-354 1944-8.

    2  Income Exempted. The following are not included in annual income:
    a  Income of dependent minors (including foster children) under 18 
years of age except as specified under 1d of the definition of annual 
income in this paragraph. (Tenant, cotenant, member or comember, or 
spouse of either may never be considered minors.)

to the educational institution, and amounts paid by the Government to a

and equipment to include materials, supplies, transportation, and 
miscellaneous personal expenses of the student. Any amounts of such

and are available for subsistence and shelter, are considered to be 
income of tenant, cotenant, member, comember, or applicant.

utility allowance.
    Site manager. The individual employed by the borrower or the 
management agent who lives at or near the project site and is

    Tenant contribution. The portion of the approved shelter cost paid 
by the tenant household (tenant rent). For tenants not receiving HUD 
Section 8, this amount will be calculated according to Form FmHA or its

consent to any change of management agent.
    B  Borrowers without a loan agreement. Unless otherwise specified, 
these borrowers are exempt from the requirements of this subpart, except 
for exhibit C of this subpart, as long as the borrower is not in default 
of any program requirement, security instrument, payment, or any other

    IV  Rent Subsidy Opportunities: The available subsidy programs 
should be considered at the time of developing a project proposal and 
during project operation as they may be available to meet the tenants' 
needs. Congregate type services such as meals, limited homecare, 
medical, transportation, and social activities are not included in these 
subsidy programs. The subsidy programs are as follows:
    A  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Interest 
Credit--RRH and RCH Loans. Regulations are contained in exhibit H to 
this subpart and include:
    1  Plan I--Only those borrowers who received this type of interest 
subsidy prior to October 27, 1980, may continue to utilize this Interest 
Credit Plan. Those broadly-based nonprofit corporations and consumer 
cooperatives may continue operating under this plan provided:
    a  Occupancy is limited to very-low or low-income non-elderly; very 
low-, low- and moderate-income person(s) who are elderly or have 
disabilities or handicaps.
    b  Budgets and rental rates are based on a 3 percent loan 
amortization.
    2  Plan II--This interest subsidy is available to broadly-based 
nonprofit corporations, consumer cooperatives, State or local public 
agencies, or to other organizations and individuals operating on a 
limited profit basis.
    a  Occupancy is limited to very-low, low-and moderate-income persons 
except as noted in paragraph VI D 2 i of this exhibit.

[[Page 229]]

    b  Budgets are prepared showing two rental or occupancy charge 
rates, basic and note rate. The minimum (basic) rate for persons not 
receiving rental assistance is based on a 1 percent subsidized rate. The 
maximum note rate is based on the loan amortized at the interest rate 
shown in the promissory note.
    c  Tenant's or member's contribution for shelter cost, calculated 
according to the FMI for Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-8, may not exceed the highest of:
    (1) Thirty percent of monthly adjusted income, or
    (2) Ten percent of gross monthly income, or
    (3) If the household is receiving payment for public assistance from 
a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically 
designated by that agency to meet the household's shelter costs (see 
example in 1k of the definition of annual income in paragraph II of this 
exhibit), or
    (4) The basic rent or occupancy charge when no RA is available from 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    d  RRH borrowers whose loans were approved on or after August 1, 
1968, may convert from Plan I to Plan II. When they are presently a full 
profit operation, they may convert to Plan II by executing a new or 
amended loan resolution or loan agreement and an interest credit and RA 
agreement according to exhibit H of this subpart.
    e  RRH borrowers with Plan I Section 8 interest credit agreements 
may change to Plan II when the 1 percent or 2 percent interest reduction 
is insufficient for the HUD contract rent to meet budgeting needs. The 
change of interest credit plan will be approved in accordance with 
paragraph VII B of exhibit C of this subpart (available at any FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office). A new Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7, ``Multiple 
Family Housing Interest Credit and Rental Assistance Agreement,'' is 
required.
    B  Rental assistance (RA) program--FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354. This is a subsidy program available to RRH, 
RCH, and LH borrowers to assist very-low and low-income tenants and 
members in paying their shelter cost. RA is not authorized for tenants 
or members whose adjusted income is initially above the low-income 
level. RA is not available to LH borrowers who are individual 
farmowners, partnerships, family corporations, or an association of 
farmers. RRH borrowers with loans approved on or after August 1, 1968, 
must be operating under, or change to, Interest Credit Plan II to 
receive RA. Full profit borrowers may utilize RA by converting to a 
limited profit operation. The provisions of the RA program are covered 
in detail in exhibit E of this subpart.
    C  HUD project based Section 8 and tenant based Section 8 Rental 
Certificate or Rental Voucher Program. These subsidy programs are 
administered by HUD or others authorized to administer the program such 
as State Housing Finance Agencies or the local public housing agency. 
Projects operating under the Memorandum of Understanding between FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and HUD (available at the 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 National Office, 
Washington, DC 20250) will also be subject to the requirements of the 
Housing Assistance Payments Contract executed by the borrower. Projects 
accepting tenants utilizing Section 8 rental certificates or rental 
voucher assistance assigned by a local public housing agency will also 
comply with any requirements imposed by such agency. However, in all 
cases, tenants receiving section 8 assistance must meet the eligibility 
requirements specified in paragraph VI D of this exhibit. Requirements 
that conflict with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
requirements should be referred to the Servicing Official for guidance. 
(Generally, the most restrictive HUD or FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 requirements or limitations will apply.)
    D  State provided subsidy. This is a subsidy program provided and 
funded by some States and available to RRH borrowers to assist tenants 
on approximately the same basis as the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 RA Program. The assistance is in accordance 
with a CONTRACT between the borrower and the State and concurred in by 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    E  Privately provided subsidy. This is a subsidy program whereby the 
project owner(s) or others enter into an Agreement with FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to provide and fund subsidy to 
tenants of the project on approximately the same basis as the FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 RA Program. In some 
instances, the agreement may include a limit on the number of units and 
a Per Unit Ceiling on the amount of assistance. Privately provided 
subsidies are typically referred to as private rental assistance.
    V  Management Operations:
    A  Management plan.
    1  A comprehensive management program is essential to the successful 
operation of a project. A written plan is the primary ingredient which 
should describe the detailed objectives, policies and procedures in 
managing the project. A management plan is required to be submitted to 
the Agency for all projects, new and existing, except for those on-farm 
LH units where rent is not required. The plan should be developed in 
detail commensurate to project size and complexity and should be 
reviewed annually and updated

[[Page 230]]

at least triennially by the borrower. To reflect project needs and to 
meet current program objectives, use of an addendum is permitted when 
few changes are made in the update of the plan. Exhibit B-1 of this 
subpart outlines the requirements of the plan.
    2  In the case of congregate housing/group homes, the management 
plan should describe, in addition to the preceding general items, the 
specific items in paragraph V B of exhibit J of this subpart.
    B  Identity of interest disclosure.
    1  General principles. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 requires that applicants/borrowers and/or management agents 
describe and fully justify any identity of interest, or appearance of 
same, that exists or will exist between the borrower, management agent, 
suppliers of materials and/or services, or vendors in any combination of 
relationship. Identity of interest will be construed as existing between 
the applicant/borrower and/or management entity and suppliers of 
materials and/or services described under but not limited to any of the 
following conditions:
    a  When there is any financial interest between the applicant/
borrower and/or management entity and the supplying entity.
    b  When one or more of the officers, directors, stockholders or 
partners of the applicant/borrower or management entity is also an 
officer, director, stockholder, or partner of the supplying entity.
    c  When any officer, director, stockholder, or partner of the 
applicant/borrower and/or management entity has any financial interest 
whatsoever in the supplying entity.
    d  When the supplying entity advances any funds to the applicant/
borrower and/or management entity.
    e  When the supplying entity provides and pays on behalf of the 
applicant/borrower and/or management entity the cost of any materials 
and/or services in connection with obligations under the management 
plan/management agreement.
    f  When the supplying entity takes stock or any interest in the 
applicant/borrower and/or management entity as part of the consideration 
to be paid them.
    g  When there exist or come into being any side deals, agreements, 
contracts or understandings entered into thereby altering, amending, or 
cancelling any of the management plan/management agreement documents, 
except as approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354.
    2  Any individual or organization sharing an identity of interest 
for the project must certify by memorandum that it is a viable, ongoing 
trade or business qualified and properly licensed to undertake the work 
for which it intends to contract.
    a  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Forms 1944-
30, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate,'' and FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-31, ``Identity of 
Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,'' (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing office) will be 
completed and submitted as part of the management plan. Management 
agents will sign either form as ``applicant.''
    b  The initial disclosure shall be in effect for a period of 3 years 
and renewed every 3 years thereafter, except if there are any changes in 
the business practices of the applicant/borrower and/or management 
entity during the interim years that include identity of interest 
concerns, the entity must file amended Forms FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-30 and FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-31.
    c  The forms provide notification to the entities of the penalty, 
under law, for erroneously certifying to the statements contained 
therein.
    d  Debarment actions will be instituted against entities who fail to 
disclose an identity of interest in accordance with the provisions of 
subpart M of part 1940 of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    C  Management agreement. The management agreement is the primary 
document by which the management agent is guided, evaluated, and 
compensated. It bears a close relationship to the management plan. A 
management agreement is required except in cases where the borrower 
(owner) fills the role of manager. Requirements of a management 
agreement are listed in exhibit B-2 of this subpart. Exhibit B-3 of this 
subpart is a sample management agreement. The two types of agreements 
acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 are 
described as follows:
    1  The owner hires a professional management agent to oversee and 
operate the project. The management agent may provide a site manager for 
on-site management and/or caretaker when justified by the size of the 
project. A qualifications statement by the management agent is required 
by the borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354. Exhibit B-4 of this subpart provides a guideline for preparing the 
statement.
    2  The owner maintains all or a part of the management role. The 
owner may use the services of a site manager in providing onsite 
management and/or services of a caretaker when justified by the size of 
the project. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
requires a qualifications statement by the owner who proposes to 
personally provide the management to determine management capability. 
Exhibit B-5 of this subpart provides a guideline for preparing the 
statement.

[[Page 231]]

    D  Responsibility. The management plan and management agreement must 
be based on applicable provisions of local, State, and Federal statutes 
and the regulatory requirements of the loan used to finance the project, 
regardless of the management system used. The owner remains totally 
responsible to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for 
the project, regardless of the authority delegated by the owner to the 
management agent.
    E  Compensation for project administration.
    1  General principles. Compensation for project administration is 
the remuneration for performance of administrative duties and 
responsibilities by those selected by the owner and approved by the 
Agency as having sufficient background and experience to manage project 
operations. The administrative duties and responsibilities must be set 
out in the management plan along with the manner in which compensation 
will be determined. It is the option of the project owners to determine 
whether to use a management agent to carry out project administrative 
functions in full or in agent to carry out project administrative 
functions in full or in part. Should a management agent be used, it is 
the option of the owner to decide which duties the management agent will 
perform and which duties will be performed by others. Whenever the owner 
chooses to use a management agent, a management agreement must be used. 
The management agreement must describe the duties and compensation for 
the services provided by the management agent. Any other duties and 
compensation for project administration not covered in by the management 
agreement, may also be considered as project expenditures. All project 
administrative expenditures must be evaluated by the Agency as being 
reasonable for the services provided, including the reasonableness of 
the expenditures for management agent services.
    2  Review of administrative expenses. The Agency is responsible for 
determining that project administrative expenses are reasonable for the 
services performed in administering project operations in an acceptable 
manner. Therefore, the Agency may use data from FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 projects or other sources for use in 
making this determination. The Agency may establish guidelines for 
administrative expenses for use within a State or area. Administrative 
expenses falling within such guidelines for services typically performed 
under the guidelines may expect expeditious action on requests for 
budget approval. Administrative expenses falling outside of such 
guidelines for services typically performed under the guidelines may 
also warrant approval when justified. The management agent or owner will 
be primarily responsible for providing evidence that such fees are 
reasonable for the services performed when the administrative expenses 
are falling outside of any established guidelines.
    3  Review of management fees. The Agency is responsible for 
determining that the fees paid for services performed by management 
agents are reasonable. Therefore, the Agency may use data from FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 projects or other sources 
for use in determining what fees are reasonable for the services 
performed in an acceptable manner by management agents. The Agency may 
establish guidelines for management fees for use within a State or area. 
Management fees falling within such guidelines for services typically 
performed under the guidelines may expect expeditious action on requests 
for approval of management agreements and budgets. Management fees 
falling outside of those guidelines may also warrant approval when 
justified. The management agent or owner will be primarily responsible 
for providing evidence that such fees are reasonable for the services 
performed when management fees are falling outside of any established 
guidelines. Whenever disputes arise as to whether an administrative 
expense is appropriate for listing under the management fee, or as to 
some other project expense, the Agency will seek to mutually resolve 
such concerns. This will be done by using the approved management 
agreement or management plan to determine which services are being 
performed by the management agent.
    4  Project administrative expenses.
    a  Acceptable administrative expenses. Those administrative expenses 
necessary to successfully carry out project operations may be approved 
provided such expenses do not duplicate any such expenses which may be 
included in the management fee as specified in the approved management 
agreement. The instructions that accompany Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7, ``Multiple Family Housing 
Project Budget,'' provide further guidance on acceptable project 
administrative expenses. Preparation of an IRS required report for the 
project, if required (e.g., Schedule K-1 (IRS Form 1065), ``Partner's 
Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, etc.'' is an acceptable project 
expense.)
    b  Unacceptable administrative expenses. Those administrative 
expenses not necessary to successfully carry out project operations may 
be denied. Preparation of income tax returns for project owners are 
unacceptable project expenses.
    5  Projects with a management agent. When management agents are 
used, the duties and compensation of the management agent must be set 
out in a management agreement. All such agreements are subject to Agency 
review and concurrence. The amount of compensation for the services 
rendered is to be

[[Page 232]]

negotiated between the owner and the management agent but is subject to 
Agency concurrence with the management agreement and approval in the 
project budget.
    6  Owner-managed projects. The owner will be authorized to manage 
the rental project only when FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 determines in writing that the owner (either as the 
individual borrower or as a part of an organizational borrower) has the 
necessary management capabilities.
    a  Projects with owners with identity-of-interest relationships to 
the management agent will not be considered as an owner managed project. 
A typical management fee may be charged as an expense to the project. 
The compensation must be according to the provisions of paragraph V E of 
this exhibit and be reasonable, earned, and not exceed the normal cost 
of similar services, had such services been provided by an independent 
management agent.
    b  Since cooperatives are to be organized as self-managed entities, 
the board of directors is not expected to have management experience. In 
lieu of this experience, the adviser to the board will provide 
management guidance during the formative years of the cooperative. Under 
the adviser's direction, the cooperative will become accustomed to this 
role and thus gain the ability to assume management responsibilities. 
If, after the required trial period outlined in subpart E of part 1944 
of this chapter, the cooperative's board is unable to assume management 
responsibilities, professional management will be hired by the 
cooperative. We would expect the amount of compensation paid to a 
cooperative adviser to be less than that paid to other types of 
management agents in order to provide the members with some equity in 
the early years. (See subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter).
    7  Initial rent-up fees. Payment of fees for a one-time effort to 
achieve initial rent-up of a newly constructed rental project is 
permitted when it is determined necessary and documented by the FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan approval official and 
the loan applicant. Rent-up fees should be paid on a per-unit basis only 
after each unit has been occupied by the initial tenant. Payment of the 
rent-up fee and other project management start-up expenses should 
generally be made from the 2 percent initial operation and maintenance 
fund. A person or firm, preferably the management agency, may be 
compensated at a rate negotiated with the applicant/borrower that 
represents reasonable compensation for the incurred marketing cost and 
project management start-up expenses.
    F  Site manager and/or caretaker services. The borrower is 
responsible for describing the plan for site management in the 
management plan. The plan needs to identify whether the site manager 
will occupy one of the project units as a revenue producing unit or as a 
rent free unit, or will live away from the project. The on-site services 
of a site manager and/or caretaker may be used when justified by the 
size, composition, and location of a project, whether the project is 
managed by a management agent or by the owner. There should be a written 
agreement between the owner or the management agent and the site manager 
to define the role and duties and compensation for the site manager and 
to provide a basis for evaluating the site manager's performance. FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may require an on-site 
resident manager and/or caretaker to assure that the loan objectives are 
met and/or to protect the tenant's or Government's interests. It is not 
mandatory that the site manager and/or caretaker meet tenant occupancy 
eligibility requirements. However, if management considers the occupied 
unit to be a rental unit, the rent paid will be determined according to 
the site manager's/caretaker's income.
    1  Calculation of rental rate for site manager or caretaker. The 
expense of providing the unit occupied by the site manager or caretaker 
will be included in the project budget the same as the expense for other 
nonrevenue producing portions of the project such as a laundry or 
community room. The rental rate will be determined as follows:
    a  When used as a revenue producing unit at approved rental rates, 
the salary paid to the site manager and/or caretaker will be included in 
the project operation and maintenance expenses. The same amount will be 
included in the annual income of the site manager and/or caretaker. The 
site manager and/or caretaker may be an eligible or ineligible tenant 
and their rent contribution will be based on their total income from all 
sources as shown on the tenant certification form.
    b  When the unit is used as a nonrevenue producing unit, the project 
cost of providing the unit will be treated the same as those of other 
nonrevenue producing portions of the project. Project rental rates will 
be established as if the unit did not exist as living quarters. Debt 
payment will be as if the unit were rented at basic rent. A tenant 
certification form will not be prepared for this situation.
    2  Owner occupancy. With the prior approval of the State Director, 
owners may occupy a unit in the project when the owner will manage the 
project rather than hiring a management agent or a site manager. The 
size, composition, and location of the project must justify the services 
of a site manager or caretaker, and the State Director must determine 
the owner is capable of performing these services. The rental rate will 
be included as described in paragraph V F 1 of this exhibit.

[[Page 233]]

    G  Projects without a site manager and/or caretaker. Projects 
without a site manager and/or caretaker must have, at a minimum, a 
tenant who will serve as a contact person or have a person who is easily 
accessible to the project who is able to represent the project manager 
or owner on maintenance and management matters.
    H  Supplemental services. Supplemental services include laundry, 
vending machine, commissary store, pay telephones, or similar tenant 
benefit services.
    1  Borrower provided supplemental services.
    a  Income from supplemental services and/or equipment and expense of 
acquisition and replacement cost shall be planned and recorded as part 
of the annual operating budget.
    b  Failure to account for all proceeds is a fraudulent act.
    2  Consignor provide supplemental services.
    a  A written contact between the borrower and consignor is required. 
The contract terms should follow ``industry'' standards for the type of 
service.
    b  Comparability in all respects to conventional supplemental 
services contracts shall govern contract with identity of interest 
between the contracting parties.
    c  The borrower's share of income will be shown as planned and 
actual income in the project operating budget.
    d  Failure by the contractual parties to account for all proceeds is 
a fraudulent act.
    VI Renting Procedure:
    A  General. Preparations for initial rent-up, occupancy and 
maintenance should begin at least 90 to 120 days ahead of the projected 
completion date of the project as described in Sec. 1944.235 of subpart 
E of part 1944 of this chapter. This procedure will include a prerent-up 
conference between the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 Serving Official, the borrower, and the person(s) responsible 
for project management. Decisions to be made concern the advertisement 
of available units, affirmative marketing practices, tenant eligibility, 
and tenant selection criteria. It is important that this conference 
precede active marketing and the receipt of tenant applications.
    B  Accommodations in communication.
    1  The borrower shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, tenants, members, and members of the 
public with handicaps and disabilities.
    a  The borrower shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids 
(electronic, mechanical, or personal assistance) where necessary to 
afford an individual with handicaps or disabilities an equal opportunity 
to participate in and enjoy the benefits of a MFH project receiving FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financial assistance.
    (1)  In determining what auxiliary aids are necessary, the borrower 
shall give primary consideration to the requests of an individual with 
handicaps or disabilities.
    (2)  The borrower is not required to provide individually prescribed 
devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a 
personal nature.
    b  Where a borrower communicates with applicants and tenants or 
members by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) 
or equally effective communication systems shall be available for use.
    2  The borrower shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that 
interested persons (including persons with impaired vision or hearing) 
can obtain information concerning the existence and location of 
accessible services, activities, and facilities in the project and 
community.
    3  This paragraph does not require a borrower to take any action 
that the borrower can demonstrate would result in a fundamental 
alteration in the nature of the project or operation or an undue 
financial and administrative burden. If an action would result in such 
undue alteration or burden, the borrower shall take any other action 
that would otherwise ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps or disabilities receive the benefits and 
services of the project.
    C  Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan. All borrowers with five 
or more rental units must meet the requirements of Sec. 1901.203(c) of 
subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter by preparing and submitting HUD 
Form 935.2, ``Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing (AFHM) Plan.'' Records 
must be maintained by the borrower reflecting efforts to fulfill the 
plan and will be reviewed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 and updated by the borrower during compliance reviews for 
title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The approved plan will be 
posted by the borrower for public inspection at the borrower's project 
site, rental office, or at any other location where tenant applications 
are received for the project. In developing the plan, the following 
items should be considered:
    1  Direction of marketing activities. The plan should be designed to 
attract applications for occupancy from all potentially eligible groups 
of people in the housing marketing area regardless of race, color, 
religion, sex, age, familial status, national origin, or handicap. The 
plan must show which efforts will be made to reach very low-income or 
low-income groups who traditionally would least likely be expected to 
apply for such housing without special outreach efforts.
    2  Marketing program. The applicant or borrower should determine 
which methods of marketing such as radio, newspaper, TV, signs, etc., 
are best suited to reach those very low-income or low-income groups who 
are least likely to apply for occupancy in the

[[Page 234]]

project. Marketing should not totally rely on ``word of mouth'' 
advertising. Appropriate social agencies and networks should be 
contacted to assist in reaching elderly (senior citizens), persons with 
handicaps, etc.
    a  Advertising.
    (1) Frequency. The borrower should advertise availability of housing 
units in advance of their availability to allow time to receive and 
process applications, determine eligibility, and arrange for move-in of 
tenants or members in a smooth flow of project operation. Advertising by 
newsprint or electronic media should occur at least annually to promote 
project visibility, even if there is an adequate waiting list.
    (2) Posters, brochures, etc. Any radio, TV, or newspaper 
advertisement, pamphlets, or brochures used must identify the project's 
handicap accessibility and contain the appropriate fair housing logotype 
or the equal housing opportunity slogan. A copy of this proposed 
material is to be submitted along with the HUD Form 935.2 for approval. 
The nondiscrimination poster entitled ``And Justice For All,'' the 
``Fair Housing'' poster and the tenant grievance and appeals procedure 
must be displayed in the rental office. If the rental office is not on 
site, the items must be displayed in a common conspicuous place on the 
site.
    b Signage.
    (1) Permanent project sign. A permanent sign identifying the project 
is required for all MFH projects approved on or after September 13, 
1977. To meet minimum requirements for an existing or new project, the 
sign, subject to state or local code:
    (i) Must be located at the primary site entrance and be readable and 
recognizable from the roadside.
    (ii) Must be located near the site manager's (or contact person's) 
office when the project has multiple sites. Portable signs will be 
placed where vacancies exist at other site locations of a ``scattered'' 
project.
    (iii) May be of any shape.
    (iv) For projects of 8 or more units, must have not less than 16 
square feet of area. Smaller projects may have smaller signs.
    (v) Including its supports, must be made of durable material.
    (vi) Must include the project name.
    (vii) Must show rental contact information including but not limited 
to the project's office location and a telephone number where applicant 
inquiries may be made.
    (viii) Must show the equal housing opportunity logotype (house 
symbol and slogan) as shown in exhibit B-11 of this subpart, OR the 
slogan ``Equal Housing Opportunity'' OR the statement ``We are pledge to 
the letter and spirit of U.S. policy for the achievement of equal 
housing opportunity throughout the nation. We encourage and support an 
affirmative advertising and marketing program in which there are no 
barriers to obtaining housing because of race, color, religion, sex, 
handicap, familial status, or national origin.'' The logotype and/or 
slogan must be permanently affixed, clearly visible and should be at 
least equal to approximately 3 to 5 percent of the sign area.
    (ix) May display the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 logotype as shown in exhibit B-12 of this subpart.
    (2) Handicap accessibility signs.
    (i) Parking spaces. Accessible parking spaces shall be designated as 
reserved for the disabled by a sign showing the international symbol of 
accessibility (see exhibit B-13 of this subpart). The sign should be 
mounted on a post at a height readily visible from an occupied vehicle. 
In snow areas, the sign needs to be visible above piled snow.
    (ii) Handicap accessibility route. When the continuous unobstructed 
ingress/egress handicap accessibility route to a primary building 
entrance is other than the usual or obvious route, the alternate route 
for handicap accessibility shall be clearly marked with handicap symbols 
and directional signs to aid a handicapped person's ingress/egress to 
the building, through an accessible entrance, and to accessible common 
use and public and living areas.
    c Community contact. Community leaders and special interest groups 
such as community, public interest, religious organizations, and 
organizations for the handicapped should be contacted in small 
communities without formal communication media aimed at the group or 
groups least likely to apply for available housing. Community contacts 
should also be used in reaching specific elements of the community such 
as the elderly or particular ethnic groups determined least likely to 
apply for the available housing.
    d Rental staff. All staff persons responsible for renting the units 
must have had training provided on Federal, State, and local fair 
housing laws and regulations and in the requirements of fair housing 
marketing and in those actions necessary to carry out the marketing 
plan. Copies of instructions to the staff regarding fair housing must be 
attached to the AFHM plan according to the instructions for part 7 of 
HUD Form 935.2.
    3 Marketing records. The borrower will be required to develop and 
maintain a system to provide data to indicate to what extent the 
borrower is carrying out the objective of the AFHM plan.
    D  Tenant eligibility and occupancy guidelines. The rental agent of 
the project must be knowledgeable about the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 tenant eligibility and occupancy requirements 
as they relate to a particular project. FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 loans require occupancy of the unit by eligible 
tenants. Except for migrant farmworker tenants in LH projects, tenant/
applicants must occupy the housing unit they

[[Page 235]]

qualify for as their permanent residence on the provision they do/will 
not maintain a separate subsidized rental unit in a different location.
    1  Eligible tenants. The following tenant eligibility criteria will 
apply where appropriate, unless otherwise authorized such as in the case 
of LH as described in subpart D of part 1944 of this chapter.
    a  To determine eligibility for occupancy, the applicant's 
eligibility income must be as defined in paragraph II and include income 
from net family assets as defined in paragraph II of this exhibit.
    b  The adjusted annual income must meet the definition of very low-, 
low- or moderate-income as defined in paragraph II of this exhibit as 
required for that specific project for applicant selection, tenant 
contribution, and continued occupancy.
    c  To determine eligibility for continued occupancy, the tenant's 
adjusted annual income must be determined at least once every 12 months. 
When the tenant's adjusted annual income exceeds the moderate-income 
limit established for the area in which the project is located, the 
tenant is no longer eligible and will be required to vacate the project 
according to the terms of the lease and paragraph VI D 6 of this 
exhibit. Continued occupancy by cooperative members will not be affected 
by this income criteria. Cooperative members, after initial 
certification of income eligibility, may remain members regardless of 
income.
    d  In RRH projects operating on a Plan I basis, tenants will:
    (1) Be a very low-, low-, or moderate-income person who is elderly, 
or has handicaps, or disabilities, or
    (2) Be a very low or low-income nonelderly, nondisabled, or 
nonhandicapped person.
    e  In RRH projects operating on a nonprofit or limited profit Plan 
II basis, tenants will be a very low-, low-, or moderate-income person 
regardless of age, disability, or handicapping condition.
    f  In RRH projects operating on a full-profit basis, tenants will:
    (1) Be a person of any income who is elderly, or has handicaps, or 
disabilities, or
    (2) Be a very low-, low-, or moderate-income nonelderly, 
nondisabled, or nonhandicapped person.
    g  In LH projects designed and operated either for year-round or 
seasonal occupancy, eligibility is established in subpart D of part 1944 
of this chapter.
    h  Occupancy in RRH project units designated by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as:
    (1) Family housing may be occupied by any combination of elderly, 
disabled, or handicapped, and/or nonelderly, nondisabled, or 
nonhandicapped tenants including those tenants with familial status. 
Marketing priorities for this category should not exclude one group over 
another.
    (2) Elderly housing must be occupied by tenants who are elderly, 
disabled, and/or handicapped but not at the exclusion of children if 
they are members of the ``elderly'' household, nor shall it be 
restricted exclusively for use by tenants who are disabled and/or 
handicapped.
    (3) Housing which consists of specific units in a project designated 
as family housing and other units designated as elderly housing units 
should be governed by paragraphs VI D 1 h (1) and (2) of this exhibit.
    (4) Congregate housing and group homes shall be occupied by persons 
described in the definitions for congregate housing and group home, 
respectively in paragraph II of this exhibit.
    i  Tenant of member independence.
    (1) RRH, RCH, and LH housing. It shall be a tenant's or member's 
responsibility to determine the ability to meet the legitimate and 
uniformly applied requirements of tenancy, thus assuming risk and 
responsibility of living within and upon the project premises. It shall 
be the owner's or representative's responsibility to respond to requests 
for what reasonable accommodations the tenant or member may need, 
otherwise the owner or its representative MAY NOT under possible penalty 
prescribed by Pub. Law No. 100-430, 102 stat. 1619 (1988) codified at 42 
U.S.C. 3601 et seq:
    (i) Judge whether individuals with handicap or disability are 
capable of independent living.
    (ii) Require a physical examination as a condition for tenant or 
member selection.
    (iii) Impose conditional leases requiring individuals with handicaps 
or disabilities to participate in supportive services.
    (2) Congregate and group home housing and housing with handicap 
unit(s). Because the purpose of such housing is to provide specific 
supportive services to individuals, it is permissible for the owner or 
its representative to inquire only to the extent necessary in the case 
of congregate housing whether the project offers the services wanted by 
the individual and in the case of group home housing, whether the 
individual has a handicap or disability that would qualify the 
individual to occupy, or continue to occupy the housing.
    (3) Legal capacity. Tenants or members in FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 financed MFH projects must possess the 
legal capacity to enter into a lease agreement, except where a legal 
guardian (an individual) may sign when the tenant or member is otherwise 
eligible and is a tenant residing in a group housing project.
    j  For LH projects and units in RRH projects specifically designed 
and designated for the elderly, disabled, and/or handicapped as defined 
by FmHA or its successor agency

[[Page 236]]

under Public Law 103-354, occupancy is limited solely to those meeting 
the eligibility requirements for the specific type of project (i.e., 
domestic farm laborers, elderly, disabled, and/or handicapped). Eligible 
occupants in these projects may also include other persons who are 
usually household members of the families of the domestic farm laborer, 
or persons who are elderly, or have disabilities, or handicaps. Resident 
assistants or chore workers will not be considered members of the 
tenant's household.
    k  A student or other seemingly temporary resident of the community 
who is otherwise eligible and seeks occupancy in an RRH or RCH project 
may be considered an eligible tenant when all of the following 
conditions are met:
    (1)  Is either of legal age in accordance with applicable State law 
or is otherwise legally able to enter into a binding contract under 
State law.
    (2)  The person seeking occupancy has established a household 
separate and distinct from the person's parents or legal guardians.
    (3)  The persons seeking occupancy is no longer claimed as a 
dependent by the person's parents or legal guardians pursuant to 
Internal Revenue Service regulations, and evidence is provided to this 
effect.
    (4)  The person seeking occupancy signs a written statement 
indicating whether or not the person's parents, legal guardians, or 
others provide any financial assistance and such financial assistance is 
considered as part of current annual income and is verified in writing 
by the borrower.
    l  A domestic farm laborer may continue occupancy of an LH project 
after retirement (having reached age 55) or after becoming disabled 
[(determined to have an impairment which is expected to be of long-
continued and indefinite duration and substantially impedes the person's 
ability to earn a livelihood from farm labor (as certified by a licensed 
physician)].
    m  A tenant who does not personally reside in a rental unit for a 
period exceeding 60 consecutive days, for reasons other than health or 
emergency, is considered ineligible for subsidy and shall be required to 
pay note rate rent in Plan II projects or 125 percent of rent in Plan I 
projects for the period of absence exceeding 60 consecutive days.
    (1)  If the tenant continues to be absent from the unit, the 
borrower must notify the tenant by certified mail at least 30 days prior 
to the end of the leasing period, to occupy the living unit by the end 
of the lease period or the borrower will start termination proceedings.
    (2)  In those cases where the tenant's lease does not contain the 
lease clause in paragraph VIII B 4 c of this exhibit, the tenant will be 
advised that the lease will not be renewed, unless replaced with a lease 
meeting current requirements.
    2  Occupancy policy and guidelines.
    a  Objective. The objective of the occupancy policy and guidelines 
in FMHA financed projects is to achieve utilization of subsidized space 
without overcrowding or providing more space than is needed by the 
number of people in the household.
    b  Policy.
    (1)  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 does not 
specify the number of persons who may live in MFH housing units of 
various sizes.
    (2)  The borrower must set reasonable occupancy standards which will 
assist as many people as possible without overcrowding the unit or the 
project and which will minimize vacancies.
    (3)  In setting the occupancy standards, the borrower must comply 
with all reasonable State and local health and safety restrictions 
regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a 
dwelling. In the absence of State or local health safety restrictions, 
overcrowding shall occur when the TOTAL occupancy level in a housing 
unit exceeds 2 people per habitable sleeping room, except that an 
additional person(s) may be allowed when a habitable sleeping room 
provides at least 50 square feet per person. A habitable sleeping room 
shall not include a kitchen, bathroom, hallway, or dining area.
    (4) In placing families on waiting lists and in assigning families 
to MFH housing, a borrower should allow families to choose whether to 
opt for larger or smaller units to permit families to occupy units of 
sufficient size, so that persons of opposite sex (other than spouses) or 
persons of same sex, persons of different or same generation, and 
unrelated or related adults may have separate bedrooms according to the 
particular needs of the family.
    (5) Borrowers may have different standards for different projects 
but such standards must not result in or perpetuate patterns of 
occupancy which would be inconsistent with title VI of the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 or the Fair Housing Act.
    (6) For the purpose of determining unit size, borrowers need to 
include, as members of the household:
    (i) All full-time members of the household.
    (ii) Dependent minors who are away at school but live with the 
family during school recesses.
    (iii) Dependent minors who are subject to a joint custody agreement 
but live in the unit at least 50 percent of the time.
    (iv) An unborn child or a child in the process of being adopted by 
or granted custody of an adult.
    (v) A foster child residing in the unit, or a household child 
temporarily residing elsewhere in foster care.
    (vi) A live-in attendant.

[[Page 237]]

    (7) Borrowers shall not provide bedroom space for others who are not 
members of the household such as adult children on active military duty, 
permanently institutionalized family members, or visitors.
    c  Guidelines. These guidelines are designed to assist the borrower 
in implementing the occupancy policy into workable occupancy standards. 
The project occupancy standard should be available for review by 
applicant, tenant, member, and project representative upon request.
    (1) In setting objective occupancy standards, the borrower should 
set the standards to permit the tenant to select the unit size they deem 
appropriate to their needs insofar as overcrowding by the household does 
not happen and underutilization of the unit does not occur. The 
occupancy standard selected should attempt to reflect ideal ranges of 
occupant density. In developing an ideal occupancy standard, it should 
be based so that:
    (i) No more than two persons should be required to occupy a bedroom.
    (ii) Persons of different generations, persons of the opposite sex 
(other than spouses), and unrelated adults should not be required to 
share a bedroom.
    (iii) Children of the same sex may share a bedroom.
    (iv) Children, with the possible exception of infants, should not be 
required to share a bedroom with persons of different generations, 
including their parents.
    (2) These guidelines should result in the following ideal range of 
persons per housing unit:
      

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 Occupant density range
                No. of bedrooms                -------------------------
                                                  minimum
------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.............................................            1            1
1.............................................            1            2
2.............................................            2            4
3.............................................            3            6
4.............................................            5            8
5.............................................            7           10
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For example, if the borrower adopts these standards, households with 
three people generally should be accomodated in a two bedroom unit and 
should not receive apartments with more than three bedrooms. Nor should 
such households be required to live in apartments with fewer than two 
bedrooms. A household of three persons could be permitted to live in an 
apartment with fewer than two bedrooms if the household so chooses, 
unless it would constitute overcrowding OR there is a state or local 
occupancy law forbidding occupancy of the unit by three or more persons.
    (3) If, because of a physical or mental handicap of a household 
member or a person associated with that household, a family may need a 
unit that is larger than the unit size suggested by the guidelines in 
paragraph VI D 2 c (2) of this exhibit, it may be an unlawful failure to 
make reasonable accommodation to deny such a family the opportunity to 
apply for and obtain such a unit.
    d  These occupancy guidelines may serve also as general guidelines 
for migrant and on-farm LH. Projects developed in compliance with local 
and/or state design requirements will determine the appropriate 
occupancy standards for migrant LH. In dormitory type LH housing, there 
must be at least 400 cubic feet of habitable sleeping area for each 
person.
    e  When there are no units of appropriate size available in the 
project:
    (1) The tenant may be admitted and/or remain, provided the unit is 
not overcrowded or underutilized.
    (2) The tenant may receive available rental subsidy if otherwise 
qualified by income.
    f  When an occupied unit becomes overcrowded or underutilized and 
there is a waiting list for the size unit occupied:
    (1) The tenant must move to another unit in the project of adequate 
size and accommodation when it becomes available. If the tenant then 
refuses to move to the available unit, or if none is available.
    (2) Vacate the project within a reasonable time period established 
by the borrower as specified in the lease or by the end of the lease 
period, whichever is later.
    g  To avoid prolonged vacancy and loss of revenue, management may 
permit temporary occupancy of specially designed handicapped accessible 
units by households not needing such specially designed features, under 
the following conditions:
    (1) No household needing the specially designed features of a 
handicapped accessible unit is available to occupy the unit and 
management has made a diligent effort to reach tenants who qualify for 
the specially designed unit;
    (2) The tenant agrees to transfer to an appropriate unit if and when 
it becomes available in the project once an applicant with handicaps 
needing the features of a handicapped accessible unit is on the waiting 
list and ready to move in;
    (3) The responsibility to pay all costs associated with the 
subsequent move to the appropriate unit shall be mutually determined 
between the owner and the tenant. The owner's share of cost, if any, may 
be a project expense; and
    (4) The appropriate lease clause in paragraph VIII C of this exhibit 
is incorporated in the tenant's lease.
    h  Borrowers with RRH projects specifically built and designated for 
the elderly prior to October 27, 1980, with only a few or no one-bedroom 
units, may permit occupancy of two-bedroom units by single eligible 
tenants if this provision is included in the project occupancy policy. 
The occupancy policy should reflect the needs of the local

[[Page 238]]

market area. This eligibility determination made by management must be 
included in the tenant's lease and will entitle such tenant to all 
benefits without need for further FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 approval.
    i  When a unit cannot be rented under the provisions in paragraph VI 
D 2 g and h of this exhibit, the Servicing Official may authorize an 
exception according to paragraph VI D 7 of this exhibit.
    j  A tenant who was determined eligible and allowed to occupy under 
regulations in effect prior to October 1, 1986, who does not meet 
eligibility requirements regarding income or occupancy policy as 
prescribed in these regulations may be permitted continued occupancy in 
the same unit for the duration of their residency. This provision 
specifically refers to:
    (1) Elderly tenants of any income level who have occupied their 
unit, since before October 27, 1980.
    (2) Tenants who were determined eligible before October 27, 1980, 
but did not meet income and occupancy requirements on that date. 
Examples are:
    (i) Individual tenants occupying a unit with separate tenant 
certifications whose combined income on October 27, 1980, would 
disqualify joint tenancy.
    (ii) Tenant households whose composition did not meet the occupancy 
guidelines in paragraph VI D 2 c (2) of this exhibit.
    (3) Tenants who became income ineligible due to changes of income 
and shelter cost determination on October 1, 1986. This provision did 
not apply to normal increase of household income which may have made 
them ineligible before October 1, 1986.
    k  For each RRH project specifically designated for the elderly, the 
borrower or management may not prohibit, prevent, restrict, or 
discriminate against any tenant for continued occupancy or applicant for 
occupancy who owns or will keep a pet in their apartment unit unless the 
approved project pet rules are violated.
    l  Nothing in this subpart requires that an apartment unit be made 
available to any individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct 
threat to the health and safety of other individuals or whose tenancy 
would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others, 
Except, when such threat can be removed by applying a reasonable 
accommodation.
    3  Reasonable accommodations.
    a  The Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988 requires persons to make 
reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, 
when such accommodations would afford a handicapped or disabled person 
equal opportunity to occupy or continue to occupy and enjoy a dwelling 
unit, including public and common use areas. For example:
    (1) It would be unlawful to refuse a person with a sight impairment 
with a service animal to live in a dwelling unit when there is otherwise 
a no-pet policy in the apartment complex.
    (2) It would be reasonable accommodation to grant a request by an 
applicant or tenant with a mobility impairment to be assigned a reserved 
parking space as near to that person's dwelling unit as possible, even 
though all other designated handicapped parking spaces are already 
reserved, having been assigned on a first-come, first served basis.
    (3) It would be reasonable accommodation to remove a gas cooking 
stove and install a microwave oven when such accommodations to a tenant 
or member would remove a direct threat to the project, the tenant and 
other tenants. Other examples are changing water faucets to push or 
electronic activated faucets and door knobs to door handles for persons 
with infirmed hands.
    b  The Fair Housing Amendment Act requires owners to permit, at the 
expense of a person with handicaps, reasonable modifications of an 
existing unit, occupied or to be occupied by a person with handicaps, if 
the proposed modifications may be necessary to afford that person full 
enjoyment of the dwelling unit.
    (1) The borrower may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition 
permission for a modification on the applicant or tenant agreeing to 
restore the interior of the dwelling unit to the condition that existed 
before the modifications, reasonable wear and tear excepted. (Note: It 
should not, for example, be necessary to remove blocking previously 
installed to support bathtub handrails when restoring to ``original'' 
condition since the blocking does not affect future use.)
    (2) The borrower may not increase the customarily required security 
deposit. However, where it is necessary to ensure with reasonable 
certainty that funds will be available to pay for the restorations at 
the end of tenancy, the borrower may negotiate as part of such a 
restoration agreement a provision requiring that a tenant pay into an 
interest bearing escrow account, over a reasonable period, an amount of 
money not to exceed the cost of restoration. The interest in any such 
account shall accrue to the tenant's benefit.
    4  Other items the borrower should consider in determining 
eligibility of applicants for admission to the project.
    a  Any criteria or documentation must be applied uniformly for all 
applicants for occupancy for the following items:
    (1) Verification of income and/or employment according to paragraph 
VII of this exhibit. (Mandatory in all cases.)
    (2) Credit reports to reflect the applicant's past record of meeting 
obligations. (Optional.)

[[Page 239]]

    (3) Prior landlord references to determine if the tenant was 
responsive to meeting rent payment obligations, care, and maintenance of 
the unit. (Optional.)
    (4) The applicant's financial capability to meet other basic living 
expenses and the rental charge, taking into consideration any subsidy 
assistance that could be made available to the tenant. Where RA is not 
available, the borrower should inform any very-low or low-income 
household that would be required but unable to pay the approved rent, 
including utilities, that they may be eligible for a particular form of 
rent subsidy described in paragraph IV of this subpart. The borrower 
should indicate where information about other subsidies can be obtained. 
(Optional.)
    (5) Written verification of an unborn child by a doctor or other 
qualified third party. (When applicable.)
    b  A borrower or manager should consider mitigating factors when 
tenants or members have had or presently have a period of hardship 
beyond their control, when they have had disputes with creditors, 
including landlords, or when they were having difficulty paying 
overburdened rent levels.
    5  Surviving or remaining members of eligible tenant household.
    a  Surviving members of an elderly, disabled, and/or handicapped 
tenant's household may continue occupancy of the unit after the death of 
the original tenant, even though they may not meet the definition of an 
elderly, disabled or handicapped person stated in paragraph II of this 
exhibit, provided:
    (1) They are eligible occupants with respect to income and were 
either cotenant or member of the household and have legal capacity to 
sign and assume the lease,
    (2) They occupied the unit with the original tenant at the time that 
the original tenant died, and
    (3) A surviving nonelderly cotenant or comember shall not qualify 
for the elderly family adjustments to income.
    b  Surviving members of a domestic farm laborer's household may 
continue to occupy when they meet the definition of a domestic farm 
laborer as defined in paragraph II of this exhibit.
    c  Remaining household member(s) of a nonelderly, nondisabled and/or 
nonhandicapped household, who is included on the current tenant 
certification may continue to occupy the rental unit if they otherwise 
independently meet tenant eligibility requirements with respect to 
income and occupancy standard size and sign a succeeding tenant 
certification establishing their own tenancy.
    d  When tenants no longer meet the requirements of paragraph VI D 5 
a, b, or c of this exhibit, the provisions for formerly eligible tenants 
in paragraph VI D 6 of this exhibit shall apply.
    6  Formerly eligible tenants. Unless authorized by paragraph VI D 2 
j of this exhibit, formerly eligible tenants will be required to vacate 
their unit within 30 days (7 days for migrant farm labor tenants with 
week-to-week lease agreements) or the end of the term of their lease 
agreement, whichever is longer. If, however, there is not an eligible 
applicant on the waiting list available for occupancy, the formerly 
eligible tenant may remain until there is an eligible tenant on the 
waiting list available to occupy the unit; at which time, the 
requirements for notice to vacate stated in paragraph VI D 6 c of this 
exhibit will take effect. If vacating the unit in the time period 
described creates an undue hardship on the family, the Servicing 
Official may permit continued occupancy for a reasonable period of time. 
The following ``formerly eligible'' situations apply to this paragraph:
    a  Tenants who no longer meet FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 income eligibility requirements. (This includes 
tenants receiving RA or Section 8 assistance.)
    b  Tenants in LH projects who no longer meet the farm labor 
occupation requirements, and who are neither retired nor disabled 
domestic farm laborers, are considered to be ``formerly eligible 
tenants'' as long as a need for housing for domestic farm laborers 
exists in the project's farm market area.
    c  Tenants who no longer meet the occupancy policy for the project. 
These tenants must agree in writing to move to a unit of appropriate 
size in the project when one becomes available, or when an appropriate 
sized unit does not exist in the project, vacate the project at the 
termination of their lease. However, the tenant may remain as an 
ineligible tenant if the unit is not overcrowded and there are no other 
applicants on the waiting list for the size of unit presently occupied.
    7  Servicing official authority to permit an RRH or LH borrower to 
rent to ineligible tenants.
    a  The Servicing Official may authorize the borrower in writing, 
upon receiving the borrower's written request with the necessary 
documentation, to rent vacant units to ineligible persons for temporary 
periods to protect the financial interest of the Government. Likewise, 
this provision may extend to a cooperative. This authority will be for 
the entire project for periods not to exceed one year. Within the period 
of the lease, the tenant may not be required to move for initially 
documented ineligibility. A copy of the authorization to rent to 
ineligibles will be forwarded to the State Office. The following 
determinations must be made by the authorizing FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 official.
    (1) There are no eligible persons on a waiting list.

[[Page 240]]

    (2) The borrower provided evidence that a diligent but unsuccessful 
effort to rent any vacant unit(s) to an eligible tenant household has 
been made. Such evidence may consist of advertisements in appropriate 
publications, posting notices in several public places, and other places 
where persons seeking rental housing would likely make contact; holding 
open houses, making appropriate contacts with public housing agencies 
and authorities (where they exist), State and local agencies and 
organizations, Chamber of Commerce, and real estate agencies.
    (3) The borrower will continue with aggressive efforts to locate 
eligible tenants and submit to the Servicing Office, along with Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29, ``Project 
Worksheet for Interest Credit and Rental Assistance,'' a report of 
efforts made. The required followup should be posted in the Servicing 
Office on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1905-6, ``Management System Card-Multifamily Housing.''
    (4) To protect the security interest of the Government, the units 
may be rented for no more than a year after which the lease must convert 
to a monthly lease. The monthly lease must require that the unit be 
vacated when an eligible prospective tenant is available. The ineligible 
tenant will then be given 30 days to vacate.
    (5) Tenants residing in RRH units who are ineligible, because their 
adjusted annual income exceeds the maximum for the RRH project, will be 
charged the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
approved note rate rental rate for the size of unit occupied in a Plan 
II RRH project. In projects operated under Plan I, ineligible tenants 
will be charged rental surcharge of 25 percent of the approved note rate 
rental rate.
    (6) Tenants permitted to occupy but who are ineligible for reasons 
other than income may benefit from RA and/or interest credit.
    (7) Tenants residing in off-farm LH units who are ineligible because 
their adjusted annual income exceeds the maximum for the area will be 
charged the lesser of the LH project's note rate rent or the prevailing 
market rent rate for the project as determined by subpart D of part 1944 
of this chapter. For on-farm tenants, rent determination may be subject 
to local discretion with limitations as set out in subpart D of part 
1944 of this chapter. Excess rent shall be remitted to the Agency for 
credit to the Rural Housing Insurance Fund.
    b  Examples of situations where the Servicing Official may authorize 
a borrower to rent units to ineligible persons to reduce chronic vacancy 
are:
    (1) In housing designated as ``family'' housing, permitting persons 
or households to occupy who are not eligible because they have an above 
normal income.
    (2) In housing designated as ``elderly'' housing, permitting persons 
or households to occupy that meet the definitional requirements of 
qualifying as elderly, but who otherwise have an above moderate income. 
This provision will not permit nonelderly persons or households to 
occupy housing for the elderly.
    c  When the Servicing Official determines that a borrower may rent 
to an ineligible tenant, the written authorization must contain the 
appropriate clauses which must be inserted into the ineligible tenant's 
lease. At a minimum it should include:
    (1) The reason for ineligibility.
    (2) The term of ineligible occupancy.
    (3) Any conditions under which the tenant will be required to vacate 
the unit including moving to an appropriate size unit when warranted to 
comply with the established occupancy standards.
    (4) The length of notice the tenant will be given to vacate.
    E  Applicant inquiries and waiting lists.
    1  When a prospective tenant or member inquires (by telephone, 
letter, or visit) concerning the availability of a rental or cooperative 
unit, the borrower or rental agent will advise the prospective applicant 
of their right to file an application.
    2  When a prospective tenant or member files a completed application 
for occupancy and is determined eligible, the borrower or rental agent 
will place the prospect's name chronologically by date and time on the 
appropriate written waiting list. Exhibit B-14 of this subpart contains 
a sample waiting list. An application is a written document(s) 
prescribed by the management providing sufficient information for the 
rental agent to complete the steps necessary to determine eligibility.
    a  Eligibility shall be governed by paragraph VI F of this exhibit.
    b  The actual determination of eligibility will be conducted 
according to the application process described in paragraph VI F of this 
exhibit.
    c  Priority on the waiting list shall be determined according to 
paragraph VI E 3 of this exhibit. Eligibility for cooperative membership 
will be determined in accordance with subpart E to part 1944 of this 
chapter.
    3  Separate waiting lists by categories and/or a master waiting list 
with income levels identified (very low-, low- and moderate-income), and 
categories or priorities indicated will be maintained for rural rental, 
cooperative, and year-round occupancy farm labor housing. Each list must 
be maintained in chronological order. When there are separate lists, 
they must be cross-referenced for prospective tenants who fit more than 
one category or priority. Separate lists may be maintained for:
    a  Income levels (very low-, low-, moderate-income, or ineligible).

[[Page 241]]

    b  Various size units.
    c  Units for elderly, disabled, or handicapped persons, families, or 
any other combination as planned for the project according to the 
borrower's loan agreement or resolution and management plan.
    d  Persons who require the special design features of the 
handicapped accessible units(s) in the project such as persons confined 
to a wheelchair or requiring other auxiliary apparatus for mobility and/
or life support. Persons on this list have priority for these units.
    e  Holders of Letters of Priority Entitlement issued by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 according to subpart E of part 
1965 of this chapter will be given top of the waiting list priority 
within an income group for the category of unit size for which the 
applicant qualifies. This same priority shall also extend to persons 
displaced due to housing rendered uninhabitable or actually seized by 
legal action (for other than illegal activities).
    f  In congregate housing projects, priority can be given to tenants 
who qualify for the services provided by the congregate facility insofar 
as there is available capacity in the facility to provide the services.
    g  In LH projects, lists should be maintained in accordance with the 
priorities of occupancy established by Sec. 1944.154 of subpart D of 
part 1944 of this chapter.
    h  In only those projects with project based Section 8 units, 
priority for such units will go to applicants who, at their time of 
housing need, are involuntarily displaced, or living in substandard 
housing, or paying more than 50 percent of income for rent.
    i  Tenant applicants that qualify the borrower for tax credit.
    4  For seasonal farm LH a waiting list should be chronologically 
compiled by date and time received as in paragraphs VI E 2 and VI E 3 of 
this exhibit. These lists should be maintained for the season in which 
the project will be operating. Prospective tenants should be advised 
that the waiting list will terminate on the closing date of the project 
in any given season. Tenant selection shall be governed according to 
paragraph VI H 6 of this exhibit.
    a  Seasonal LH management plans should identify a date when 
applications will be accepted for a new operating season and a waiting 
list compiled.
    b  A process should be specified in the plan for advising 
prospective tenants of the application process and the dates of project 
operation.
    5  A waiting list must show the racial identity of the prospective 
tenant. Rental housing managers may determine how the identification is 
to be made according to the guidance found at exhibit B-14 of this 
subpart, which may include the use of a code system.
    6  When prospective tenants are first assigned to the waiting list, 
they will be notified of the category(s) to be assigned to their 
application. Prospective tenants may inquire to determine the place of 
their application on the waiting list. However, to protect the privacy 
of all prospective tenants, the waiting list should not be shown to any 
prospective tenants.
    7  Borrowers may establish a procedure for purging the waiting 
list(s) periodically of prospective tenants who are no longer interested 
in occupancy. The borrower must inform each prospective tenant of this 
procedure and any actions they must take to maintain their priority 
position on the waiting list. When a name is removed from the waiting 
list by the borrower, the prospective tenant must be informed in writing 
at their last known address. The letter must include appeal rights under 
subpart L of part 1944 of this chapter.
    8  Expired waiting lists must be kept on file by the borrower or 
management agent until a compliance review has been conducted by FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in accordance with subpart 
E of part 1901 of this chapter.
    F  Applications, eligibility determination and notification of 
eligibility or rejection.
    1  Application status for determining eligibility. All persons 
desiring to apply for occupancy, whether as the initial applicant 
household or as a person(s) later joining an existing tenant household, 
will be provided the opportunity to submit a complete application. The 
borrower or rental agent will provide prospective tenants or members 
with a written list of all information required for a complete 
application and offer assistance in completing the application if 
needed.
    a  After the potential tenant or member has submitted all required 
forms and information but additional information is required, the 
borrower or rental agent must notify the applicant within 10 days of the 
items needed to complete a review of eligibility. The application file 
will be documented on the action taken.
    b  When the application is complete, and occupancy by the applicant 
is expected within 90 days of completing the application, eligibility 
will be determined, including verification of applicant information 
performed according to paragraph VII of this exhibit; otherwise, 
verification of applicant information will be initially satisfied upon 
sufficient review of the information to determine whether the applicant 
is clearly eligible or not eligible.
    c  Applicants determined eligible will be added to the waiting list 
according to paragraph VI E 2 of this exhibit, even when an operational 
project has few or no vacancies, and there are sufficient active 
applications from households determined eligible to fill expected 
vacancies.

[[Page 242]]

    d  Application fees are discouraged, but when used, any fee charged 
to a prospective tenant shall be limited to the cost of actual services 
incurred for obtaining necessary information associated with completing 
a tenant certification.
    2  Fair housing restrictions and provisions.
    a  It shall be unlawful for a person to make an inquiry to determine 
whether an applicant for a housing unit, or anyone associated with that 
applicant, has a handicap or disability or to make inquiry as to the 
nature or severity of a handicap or disability of such a person. 
However,
    b  The following inquiries are not prohibited, provided these 
inquiries are made of all applicants, whether or not they have handicaps 
or disabilities.
    (1) Inquiry into an applicant's ability to meet the requirements of 
tenancy (i.e., eligibility, history of meeting financial obligations) 
and without being a direct threat to the health and safety of other 
individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage 
to the property of others.
    (2) Inquiry to determine whether an applicant is qualified for a 
housing unit or adjustment to income available only to persons with 
handicaps or disabilities or to a persons with a particular type of 
handicap or disability.
    (3) Inquiry to determine whether an applicant for a housing unit is 
qualified for a priority available to persons with handicaps or 
disabilities or to persons with a particular type of handicap.
    (4) Inquiring whether an applicant for a dwelling is a current 
illegal user of a controlled substance or has a previous conviction of 
the same.
    (5) Inquiring whether an applicant has been convicted of the illegal 
manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance.
    (6) Inquiring whether an applicant answering positively to F 2 b (4) 
or (5) of this paragraph has successfully completed a controlled 
substance abuse recovery program or is presently enrolled in such a 
program.
    3  Application requirements. At a minimum to be considered complete, 
applications must include for each prospective tenant household 
sufficient information, such as the following, to complete a tenant 
certification form:
    a  Name and present address.
    b  Household income information, as defined under annual income, 
adjusted annual income, and net family assets in paragraph II of this 
exhibit.
    c  Age and number of household members.
    d  Indication whether applicant requests either a handicap/
disability adjustment to income or a special handicapped accessible unit 
or both.
    e  Applicant's certification that the unit applied for will be the 
applicant household's permanent residence and it does/will not maintain 
a separate subsidized rental unit in a different location.
    f  Signature and date section.
    g  Race, national origin and sex designation. This designation shall 
be placed as the last section of the application form beneath the 
signature and date section.
    (1) The borrower or management agent will request that each 
prospective tenant or member provide this information on a voluntary 
basis to enable monitoring or compliance with Federal laws prohibiting 
discrimination. When the applicant does not provide this information, 
the rental agent or board will complete this item based on personal 
observation or surname.
    (2) The following disclosure notice shall appear on the tenant 
application form or on an amendment to the application:
    ``The information regarding race, national origin, and sex 
designation solicited on this application is requested in order to 
assure the Federal Government, acting through the Farmers Home 
Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, that 
Federal Laws prohibiting discrimination against tenant applicants on the 
basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, 
age, and handicap are complied with. You are not required to furnish 
this information, but are encouraged to do so. This information will not 
be used in evaluating your application or to discriminate against you in 
any way. However, if you choose not to furnish it, the owner is required 
to note the race/national origin and sex of individual applicants on the 
basis of visual observation or surname.''
    h  The application form shall contain the fair housing logotype or 
slogan and indication of handicap accessibility on the first page of the 
form.
    i  Retired or disabled domestic farm labor applicants must meet the 
definition requirements of Sec. 1944.153 of subpart D of part 1944 of 
this chapter.
    4  Notification to applicant. The applicant who has submitted a 
completed application will be notified in writing that he or she has 
been selected for immediate occupancy, placed on a waiting list, or 
rejected.
    5  Applicants determined ineligible. After due consideration of 
mitigating circumstances, applicants determined ineligible will be 
notified in writing of the specific reasons for rejection. The letter 
will include the following statement: ``The Fair Housing Act prohibits 
discrimination in the sale, rental or financing of housing on the basis 
of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national 
origin. Federal law also prohibits discrimination on the basis of age. 
Complaints of discrimination may be forwarded to the Administrator, FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, USDA Washington, DC 
20250.'' This statement can be placed on all materials and 
correspondence

[[Page 243]]

done by the borrower, owner, or management company.
    a  The rejection letter must also outline the applicant's rights to 
appeal the rejection and be sent or hand-delivered according to subpart 
L of part 1944 of this chapter except for those clearly not eligible for 
occupancy according to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 regulations.
    b  When the rejection is based on information from a credit bureau, 
the source of the credit bureau report must be revealed to the applicant 
in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
    c  Any applicant household may be rejected due to:
    (1) A history of unjustified and/or chronic nonpayment of rent and/
or financial obligations.
    (2) A history of living or housekeeping habits that would pose a 
direct threat to the health and safety of other individuals or whose 
tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of 
others.
    (3) A history of disturbance of neighbors.
    (4) A history of violations of the terms of previous rental 
agreements, especially those resulting in eviction from housing or 
termination from residential programs.
    d  Rejection of applicants on a arbitrary basis is prohibited. 
Examples of such arbitrary rejections includes considering the following 
factors in determining a tenant's eligibility:
    (1)  Race, color, religion, sex, age, familial status, national 
origin, handicap (except in those projects or portions of projects 
designated for elderly, disabled and/or handicapped, where occupancy by 
nonelderly, nondisabled or nonhandicapped can be prohibited).
    (2)  Receipt of income from public assistance.
    (3)  Families with children of uncertain parentage.
    (4)  Participation in tenant organizations.
    (5)  Tenants or tenant family members with AIDS.
    e  In the case of LH projects, no organization borrower, other than 
an association of farmers of family farm corporation or partnership, 
will block lease to, or otherwise require that an occupant work on any 
particular farm or for any particular owner or interest as a condition 
of occupancy of the housing.
    f  Rejected applications must be kept on file by the borrower or 
management agent for a period of 3 years or until a compliance review 
has been conducted by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 in accordance with subpart E of part 1901 of this chapter.
    G  Tax credit compliance. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 permits certain 
RRH borrowers to receive tax credits for low-income housing projects if 
20 percent or more of the units are occupied by very low-income tenants 
whose annual gross income is 50 percent or less of the area median gross 
income; or 40 percent or more of the units are occupied by tenants whose 
annual gross income is 60 percent or less of the area median gross 
income.
    1  Eligible borrowers with projects qualified to receive tax credits 
will follow the tenant selection criteria of paragraph VI H of this 
exhibit except that tenant selection may be postponed until applicants 
for occupancy are available whose occupancy will allow borrowers to meet 
their tax credit requirements.
    2  Borrowers using IRS tax credits may neither terminate a tenant's 
occupancy nor refuse to renew a tenant's lease except for material 
noncompliance or other good cause as described in paragraph XIV of this 
exhibit. Tenants whose income increases after initial occupancy and 
exceeds IRS tax credit thresholds, but otherwise still meet FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 income eligibility thresholds, 
remain qualified to occupy with respect to income eligibility.
    H  Tenant and member selection.
    1  An eligible applicant will be selected from a waiting lists(s) 
identifying the category on basis of the applicant's unit size needed, 
income level (very low-, low-, moderate-income, or ineligible) or from a 
priority waiting list, as described in paragraph VI E of this exhibit, 
when the available size unit meets the applicant's need. The eligible 
applicant will further be selected on a first-come, first-served basis 
from the selected category or priority waiting list in the following 
order:
    a  Very low-income
    b  Low-income, up to 60 percent of median income, (in ``tax credit'' 
projects)
    c  Low-income
    d  Moderate-income
    e  Ineligible
    2  When RA is available:
    a  Very low-income applicants eligible for RA have a priority over 
all other applicants on each type of waiting list maintained by the 
borrower in accordance with paragraph XI of exhibit E to this subpart.
    b  Low-income applicants may be selected provided no very low-income 
applicants remain on the waiting list.
    c  Moderate-income applicants may not be selected for occupancy when 
the number of unassigned RA units equals or exceeds the number of vacant 
units. (Borrowers unable to use RA may consider requesting a transfer of 
RA authority according to paragraph XV of exhibit E of this subpart).
    3  In only those projects when project based section 8 is available, 
the following applicants, as described in HUD handbook 4350.3 (available 
at any HUD regional or area

[[Page 244]]

office), will have priority over other applicants if at the time of 
their housing needs, they are:
    a  involuntarily displaced, or
    b  living in substandard housing, or
    c  paying more than 50 percent of income for rent.
    4  Selections are to be made from the waiting list or category 
maintained for the particular unit size and/or unit type in which a 
vacancy exists. If the applicant cannot accept the unit at that time, 
the reason for not accepting the living unit will be documented in the 
project records and confirmed with the applicant in writing. The 
applicant's name will then be removed from the waiting list following 
the notice procedure at paragraph VI E 7 of this exhibit unless the 
rental agent determines that hardship exists for reasons such as 
documented health problems or project rent exceeds 30 percent of 
adjusted monthly income without RA in which case the applicant's name 
will remain on the list in chronological order. An applicant whose name 
has been removed from the waiting list may reapply.
    5  When there are no applicant names on the waiting list for the 
size and/or type of vacant living unit, a name may be selected from the 
waiting list of another size and/or type of living unit according to the 
date order of the application on the master waiting list. The selected 
tenant will be subject to the provisions for ineligible tenants found in 
paragraph VI D 7 of this exhibit and the provisions of paragraph VI D 2 
of this exhibit.
    6  In LH projects, paragraphs VI H 1 and 2 of this exhibit do not 
apply. Eligible LH applicants will be selected according to paragraphs 
VI H 4 and 5 of this exhibit and the priority stated in Sec. 1944.154 
(a) of subpart D of part 1944 of this chapter irrespective of the 
availability of RA. However, when FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 concurs with the LH borrower's determination that 
there is a diminished need for housing for domestic farm laborers in 
accordance with Sec. 1944.154 (b) of subpart D of part 1944 of this 
chapter, all the provisions of this paragraph are applicable to initial 
occupancy by applicants eligible only under the RRH program.
    I  Tenant or member record file. A separate file must be maintained 
for each tenant or member. Tenants must be allowed reasonable access to 
their own file for review during regular project office hours. This file 
will include items such as application, tenant certification with 
attached income and adjustment(s), verification forms and calculations, 
lease or occupancy agreement and attachments, inspection reports for 
moving in and moving out, correspondence and notices to the tenant or 
member, and any other necessary information. The income verification, 
tenant and member eligibility certification and recertification 
information must be retained for at least 3 years while the tenant or 
member is living in the unit and for 3 years after the tenant or member 
has moved out.
    J  Marketing incentives: Marketing incentives, as described in the 
management plan, may be used anytime as a means of maintaining occupancy 
levels and revenue needed to carry out the objectives of the housing and 
the projections of the annual project budget.
    1  When a need is documented, marketing incentives will be included 
in annual project operations as reflected in the project budget, Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7. The 
incentives will be governed by the guidance at paragraph III B 3 c of 
exhibit F of subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter (available at any 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    2  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval of 
marketing incentives.
    a  When marketing incentives will enhance program objectives during 
a ``soft'' market and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 is otherwise not aware of any loan servicing difficulties of major 
concern, cost effective incentives may be approved by the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official as part of 
normal project budget approval.
    b  When major loan servicing difficulties exist, cost effective 
marketing incentives may be approved as part of a servicing plan 
according to the provisions of exhibit F of subpart B of part 1965 of 
this chapter (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 office).

 VII  Certification and Verification of Tenant or Member Income and/or 
             Employment Information and Corrective Actions.

    The borrower/management agent shall obtain tenant or member 
authorization to verify income and/or employment information needed to 
establish eligibility before pursuing verifications.The Borrower/
management agent shall seek verification of income and/or employment 
information disclosed from third party sources without further 
involvement of the members of the tenant household. This borrower/
management agent shall seek to verify employment for all FMH program 
recipients. The borrower/management agent shall also seek to verify 
income for all MFH program recipients, except those residents of LH farm 
borrowers who are living in housing provided on a nonrental basis. The 
applicable employment and/or income verifications must normally be 
verified by the borrower or management agent before the person is 
determined eligible. Exceptions

[[Page 245]]

may be made for those unusual cases described herein. Information for 
the determination of eligibility is valid for not more than 90 days 
before the effective date of the tenant certification. Should 
verifications reveal discrepancies from the information provided, the 
borrower or management agent will seek prompt resolution using the 
principles set out in this subpart.
    A  Verification of income from employment. Verification of income 
from employment, authorized by the tenant or member/applicant, must be 
obtained from the employer in writing and filed in the ``Tenant or 
Member Record File.'' Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1910-5, ``Request for Verification of Employment,'' or 
comparable form, will be used for this purpose. (A reproducible copy of 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1910-5 is 
available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office.)
    B  Verification of income from other sources. Any income from other 
than employment (e.g., social security, Veterans Administration, public 
assistance) must be verified in writing by the income source. 
Verification of income must be documented and filed in the ``Tenant or 
Member Record File.'' When it is not immediately possible to obtain the 
written verification from the income source, the income may be 
temporarily verified by actually examining the income checks, check 
stubs, or other reliable data the person possesses which indicates gross 
income.
    C  Verification of income and/or employment for LH tenants.
    1  Verification of income from all sources. Income verification is 
required for domestic farm laborers, including migrant farm-workers, 
except for those farmworkers where their housing is provided rent free 
on a farm as part of their employment compensation for farm labor 
performed on the farm where they live and work. All domestic 
farmworkers, where income verification is required, must have a 
substantial portion of income from farm labor as defined in 
Sec. 1944.153 of subpart D of part 1944 of this chapter. When the 
tenants do not have easily verifiable income, the borrower may forecast 
income expected to be received by the tenant during occupancy for 
determining eligibility and subsidy assistance.
    2  Farm labor employment verification. Farm labor employment 
verification is required for all domestic farm laborers, whether they 
are year-round, seasonal, or migrant farmworkers, or farmworkers living 
in rent-free housing on the farm where they work. Such employment 
verification is in addition to the income verification requirements 
described in paragraph VII C 1 of this exhibit.
    3  Third party verification.
    a  Third party verification of income and employment, as applicable, 
is required whenever it is possible or available.
    b  When third party verification of income and employment is not 
possible or available, for reasons such as refusal or lack of third 
party availability or cooperation, the borrower may ``self-certify'' the 
farmworker applicant using any available documents or records the 
applicant may have or information the applicant can provide. In the 
absence of available income and employment documents, records, or 
information, the borrower may forecast income as described in paragraph 
VIIC1 of this exhibit.
    4  Tenant record file. Verifications of any type must be documented 
and filed in the ``Tenant Record File'' or in the borrower loan docket, 
as appropriate.
    D  Sample of tenant or member income and/or employment verification.
    1  The Servicing Office staff is required to make a sample of tenant 
or member income verifications and adjustments to income; in the case of 
LH tenants, employment verifications for use in evaluating the adequacy 
of such verifications. This will normally be performed during a 
scheduled supervisory visit.
    2  The sample will follow the process set out in exhibit F-1 of this 
subpart. The sample can be derived from information on the certification 
forms that will be submitted to the Servicing Office in accordance with 
paragraph VII F of this exhibit and may include verification of 
information from third party sources. At least six tenant households 
will be sampled (or 100 percent of all tenant households for projects 
having six or fewer units) during any sampling.
    3  The sample should be representative of very low-, low-, and 
moderate-income persons in the project, including those receiving 
subsidy assistance, those paying in excess of the level cited in 
paragraph IVA2c (1), (2), or (3) of this exhibit for the costs of rent 
or occupancy charge and utilities, and those paying the note rate rent.
    4  The Servicing Office staff will conduct the sample (and document 
the selection method) at any time he/she may be knowledgeable of 
discrepancies in income and/or employment verifications.
    5  If the sample discloses discrepancies of amounts in excess of $40 
monthly or $480 annually, the Servicing Officer will be required to 
notify the borrower/management agent to resolve the issues. Should 
resolution not be satisfactorily approved, the Servicing Officer will be 
required to investigate further and report to the State Director along 
with a recommendation for further action. Such further actions may 
include those authorized under FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 Instructions 2012-B or

[[Page 246]]

1940-M (available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 office) or subpart N of part 1951 of this chapter.
    E  Use of HUD certification form for Section 8 or Section 8 Rental 
Certificate or Rental Voucher Recipients. HUD Form 50059, or another HUD 
form approved by HUD for this purpose, may be used in lieu of Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 for the tenants 
receiving project based Section 8 or tenant based Rental Certificate or 
Rental Voucher assistance. However, the tenant's income cannot exceed 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 limits for the 
type of housing project involved if it has been calculated according to 
the formula contained in Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-8.
    F  Certifications and corrective actions.
    1  To be current, the tenant or member certification Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 (or for section 8, 
the appropriate HUD form) must be submitted in such manner that it is 
received in the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Servicing Office by the close of business (COB) of the due date as 
follows:
    a  New tenant or member move-in certification due date.
    (1) Move in on the 2nd through the 23rd. The certification is due 
for receipt in the Servicing Office on or before the first of the next 
month for all new tenants or members permitted to move in for occupancy 
from the 2nd through the 23rd day of a month for overage charges to be 
avoided (Example: A change is reported on July 2nd, the effective date 
is August 1, and the Servicing Office must receive the certification by 
COB on August 1). If the due date falls on a non-working day, overage 
will not be charged if the tenant certification is received in the 
Servicing Office on the next working day.
    (2) Move in from 24th through the 1st of next month. The 
certification is due for receipt in the Servicing Office on or before 
the tenth of the month in which it is effective in order to avoid 
overage charges (Example 1: Move-in is June 24th, effective date is 
July 1st and the Servicing Office must receive the certification by COB 
July 10th. Example 2: Move-in is July 1st, effective date is July 1st 
and the Servicing Office must receive by COB July 10th). If the due date 
falls on a nonworking day, overage will not be charged if the tenant 
certification is received in the Servicing Office on the next working 
day.
    b Certification due dates for renewals. Tenant certifications 
represent the contractual basis for delivery of benefits to tenants. 
Therefore, any certification being renewed must be received by Servicing 
Officials on or before the effective date in order to avoid overage 
charges. The effective date is the first day of the month following 
expiration of the current certification. Certifications expire on the 
last day of the month, 12 months from the effective date (Example: The 
last certification was effective on July 1 and its ending period date 
was 12 months later on June 30, therefore, the renewed certification 
effective date is July 1). If the due date falls on a nonworking day, 
overage will not be charged if the tenant certification is received in 
the Servicing Office on the next working day.
    c  Tenant reported changes and corrective actions. Changes to 
unexpired tenant certifications represent adjustments to the existing 
contractual basis for delivery of benefits to tenants. Therefore, 
overage may not be invoked as a penalty for any late reporting, since 
overage is merely an offset to arrive at the proper subsidy benefits a 
tenant is entitled to receive. Tenants are responsible for reporting any 
changes in household gross income, adjustments to household income or 
changes in household size (as set out in paragraph VIIF3a of this 
exhibit) no later than 30 days after the change occurred. Landlords must 
recertify tenant households in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph VIIF3b of this exhibit. When recertification is required, 
landlords must promptly seek to verify employment and/or income with 
third-party sources in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs VII 
A, B, C, and F 10 of this exhibit. Once verification is obtained from 
third-party sources, landlords are expected to forward such 
certifications to the Servicing Office in accordance with the timeframes 
set out herein.
    (1) Reporting 2nd through 23rd. If the third-party verifications are 
received from the 2nd through the 23rd day of the month, the 
recertification is due for receipt in the Servicing Office on or before 
the first day of the next month. If the due date falls on a nonworking 
day, it will be considered on time if received in the Servicing Office 
on the next working day.
    (2) Reporting 24th through the 1st of the next month. If the third-
party verifications are received from the 24th through the 1st of the 
next month, the recertification is due for receipt in the Servicing 
Office on or before the COB on the tenth of the month. If the due date 
falls on a nonworking day, it will be considered on time if received in 
the Servicing Office on the next working day.
    (3) Effective date of changed net tenant contribution. The effective 
date of a tenant's changed net tenant contribution will be the first day 
of the month following third-party verification of changes or the first 
day of the following month (generally 30 days later) permitted according 
to the tenant notice requirements of State or local law.
    (4) Corrective actions on tenant problems.
    (i) Should the tenant be found to not comply with the 30-day 
reporting requirements, the landlord may initiate actions as set out

[[Page 247]]

in the lease and the Agency may initiate action to ensure appropriate 
corrective action is taken.
    (ii) If the landlord chooses to pursue termination, the landlord 
need not further pursue recovery of any improper benefits from the 
tenant but shall instead forward a report on the circumstances to the 
Agency for its consideration on whether to initiate an appropriate 
servicing action.
    (iii) If the landlord chooses to permit the continued occupancy by 
the tenant the landlord must take steps to pursue corrective actions, 
taking into consideration any rights the tenant may have under the 
grievance procedures in subpart L of part 1944 of this chapter.
    (iv) In processing corrective actions where existing certifications 
have not expired, overage may not be charged for failure to report 
changes in a timely manner and the note rate rent will not be charged. 
Processing corrective actions will use the corrected accurate 
information to establish the proper rent levels, subsidies, and any 
overage charges using the same principles as would apply had the change 
been promptly processed.
    (v) Upon determining any resulting differences, the landlord may 
initiate actions to seek recovery from the tenant of any improper 
benefits derived from inappropriate rent levels or inappropriate 
subsidies. Such recovery efforts will normally not extend over a 3-month 
period, but may not ever extend over a 12-month period.
    (vi) The Servicing Office may be consulted if guidance is needed on 
processing corrective actions when payments are affected.
    (vii) When appropriate, the Agency may pursue servicing initiatives 
which may include seeking corrective action by the landlord or using the 
authorities set out in subpart N of part 1951 of this chapter or FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2012-B 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office).
    (5) Corrective actions on landlord problems. Should the landlord be 
found to not comply with the above reporting dates, the Agency may 
initiate action to ensure that the proper rent levels were assessed, the 
proper payments were remitted to the Government, and that any 
remittances involving any improperly paid Government subsidies are 
recovered by the Government. Such initiations may involve seeking 
corrected payment remittances, or the use of authorities set out in 
subpart N of part 1951 of this chapter as cited in paragraph VII F 1 c 
(4) of this exhibit.
    d  Modifications.
    (1) Modifications will likely result from changes to project rents 
or utility allowances or when the tenant household moves to a different 
unit within the project. In such cases the landlord may revise the 
unexpired tenant certification form by notating the changes in rents or 
utility allowances and recomputing the net tenant contribution when 
necessary.
    (2) Unexpired tenant certification forms showing modification(s) 
which do not result from changes in income or adjustments to income or 
change of household size or composition need not be submitted to the 
Agency. Such modifications do not affect the certification effective 
dates or expiration dates of the certification form being modified, 
therefore, the certification expiration date will remain unchanged (and 
overage is not applicable). (Example: Certification with a July, 19xx 
effective date is in effect for a 12-month period, and any mid-term 
modification will not alter the July 1, 19xx effective date).
    (3) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1951-
29, ``Multiple Family Housing--Changes To Tenant Status,'' or similar 
reporting format, will be prepared and submitted to report the 
modifications, impact on rental assistance, move-outs, 60-day absences, 
and expired tenant certifications.
    2  When the Servicing Office does not have a certification in the 
office as required in F 1 of this paragraph, the tenant or member is 
ineligible for RA and interest credit for that month and overage for the 
month will be charged to the project account. This does not apply to 
modification of a certification as described in paragraph VII F 1 d of 
this exhibit or in a situation as described at paragraph XIV A 5 b 
(2)(vi) of this exhibit.
    a  If a formal eviction process has started, the provisions of 
paragraph VII F 6 d of this exhibit will be followed.
    b  If the late certification was due to noncooperation by the tenant 
or member (noncooperation does not include situations beyond the control 
of the tenant member, such as delays by third-party sources in 
completing income or employment verifications), overage must be paid and 
is a project expense; however, the borrower or management agent may 
attempt to recover the charge by billing the person note rate rent 
(overage) for the month. If the error was due to the borrower's or 
management's action, the cost of overage will be a project expense and 
it will not be charged to the person.
    c  Overage charges due to negligent management may not be considered 
cause for a rent increase. The costs should be deducted from return on 
owner investment or from management agent fees and may be cause for 
requiring different management.
    3  Reporting changes.
    a  Tenant reporting. Tenants must report changes in household income 
(gross income) or adjustments to household income. In addition, any 
change in household size must be

[[Page 248]]

promptly reported to the landlord. Changes to household income may 
result from changes in hours worked, salary rates, social security, 
pensions, public assistance payments, the sale of assets, interest 
income, the amount of net family assets exceeding $5,000, imputed 
income, or other sources of income. Changes in adjustments to income may 
result from changes in household members other than the tenant or 
cotenant (e.g., changes in the number of minors, disabled, handicapped 
or full-time students 18 or older), changes in the tenant or cotenant 
(e.g., changes in the elderly, disabled, or handicapped status), changes 
in medical care expenses, and changes in child care expenses.
    b  Landlord reporting. Landlords must recertify tenant households 
whenever permanent changes to gross household income or permanent 
adjustments to household income result in an increase of $40 or more per 
month or $480 or more per year. Landlords must recertify tenant 
households whenever changes to permanent household income or permanent 
adjustments to household income result in a decrease of $20 or more per 
month or $240 or more per year. If the permanent gross income of a 
tenant household does not exceed $20 a month or $240 annually, and the 
tenant requests certification, the borrower will process the 
recertification. In addition, landlords must recertify changes in 
household size or composition.
    4  The current certification form will be revised by correcting 
entries and being initialed by the tenant or member and the owner's 
representative when there are project changes such as:
    a  Changed rental or occupancy rates and/or utility allowances.
    b  Tenant or member relocation within the project.
    c  Addition or removal of household RA.
    5  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 
must be processed as follows:
    a  Borrowers or their representatives may sign Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 up to 60 days prior to 
the effective date.
    b  Borrowers or their representatives should submit Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 to the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Office during the 30 
day period preceding the effective date. Borrowers should not delay 
submitting certifications until Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-29 is submitted. Borrowers should avoid 
submitting certifications just before or on the first day of a month to 
reduce impact on first of month account servicing at the Servicing 
Office, and to minimize late delivery and the charge of overage.
    c  The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Servicing Office date stamps each Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 when received, reviews each form 
submitted and determines that the information is complete, and correctly 
computed based on the information provided on the form (see Guide Letter 
1930-1 for use in noting exceptions).
    d  The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
approved tenant certifications and recertifications have an effective 
period of 12 months. The effective period begins on the effective date 
which is always the first day of a month.
    6  Each tenant or member must be recertified within 12 months of the 
previous certification. Tenants receiving Section 8 assistance will be 
certified according to HUD regulations.
    a  It is the tenant's or member's responsibility to provide income 
information and sign the certification form as a condition for continued 
occupancy. Failure to do so will cause a charge for overage/surcharge 
during those months such information was not provided, and it may result 
in termination of occupancy.
    b  The borrower's responsibility is to:
    (1) Notify the tenant or member that a current certification and 
income verification is required before the due date and explain the 
procedure necessary to accomplish recertification. Normally, this 
initial written notice will be sent 75 to 90 days prior to the 
expiration date of the current certification; then
    (2) Obtain verification of income from tenant or member records and/
or directly from tenant or member employers and process the appropriate 
tenant recertification; and
    (3) Submit the signed recertification to be received by the 
Servicing Office by the due date stipulated in paragraph VII F 1.
    (c)  The borrower must provide a second written notice to the tenant 
or member 30 days prior to the due date if they have not responded. The 
second notice must advise the tenant or member that without a current 
certification, the person will be required to pay note rate rent or 
occupancy charge (i.e., the person pays overage) and that termination 
proceedings may be started as of the due date since an annual 
recertification is required for continued occupancy. [Note: In any 
event, the borrower is required to pay the overage amount to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 according to 
Sec. 1951.506(a)(5)(iii) of subpart K to part 1951 of this chapter.] If 
the tenant or member has RA, the person must be advised that without a 
current certification, the person's RA will be canceled and possibly may 
not be immediately available for reinstatement should a proper 
certification be provided at a later date.
    d  When a notice of termination has been served on a tenant or 
member for failure to recertify, the borrower must provide a copy

[[Page 249]]

of the termination notice to the Servicing Office prepared according to 
paragraph XIVB of this exhibit. If the Servicing Official does not 
receive a new certification on such person(s), the Servicing Official 
will annotate the project master list with an E beside the ``Expiration 
Date of Tenant Certification'' on Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-29 for the appropriate tenant(s) or 
member(s). The Servicing Official will continue to authorize interest 
credit and waiver of overages while the termination is being actively 
pursued until resolution of the termination. The payment of RA will be 
suspended during the termination process. Upon conclusion of the 
termination process the RA will either be reinstated or given to another 
tenant or member.
    7  The borrower must submit Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-29 to the Servicing Office with each payment, 
report of overage, or request for RA as required in paragraph XIIIC2f(1) 
of this exhibit. The calculations on part II of the form must be for 
tenants or members in residence on the first day of the month preceding 
the payment due date. All calculations will be made as if the tenant or 
member was in residence for the full month. Adjustments Will Not Be Made 
to the Borrower's Subsidy, RA Request, Payment, or Overage Charges for 
Persons Moving in or Out After the First of the Month. (See Guide Letter 
1930-1 for any necessary Servicing Official's response after review of 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29.)
    8  Paragraph VIII B 4 b of this exhibit is a required lease or 
occupancy agreement provision requiring tenants or members to notify the 
management of any change in gross household income or adjustments to 
income, or size or composition of household. Upon receipt of such 
notice, the borrower must promptly obtain a new certification form and 
income verification and submit it to the Servicing Office when there is 
a permanent change in size or composition of the household, or a 
permanent increase of $40 or more per month ($480 per year) or a 
permanent decrease of $20 or more per month ($240 per year) in gross 
household income or adjustment to income.
    9  When a borrower/agent believes that an applicant/tenant or member 
certification or income verification is inaccurate, they may provide the 
information including the tenant's or member's social security number to 
the Servicing Office requesting a further verification through the 
appropriate State employment agency. The Servicing Office will forward 
the request to the State Director for submission to the State Agency 
that keeps records on the incomes of wage earners. The State Director 
will develop a method of obtaining the information from the State 
Agency. Any reasonable cost for information provided by a State shall be 
a project expense.
    10  Landlords may use the following emergency certification/
recertification procedure in the unusual cases described herein, but 
must otherwise meet the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 submission requirements stated in paragraph VII F 1 of this 
exhibit:
    a  When a tenant or member applicant needs to initially occupy 
before income verification is complete, or when a borrower has been 
unable to initiate recertification on time, an ``estimated'' 
verification may be performed and the certification and the lease or 
occupancy agreement completed and marked ``subject to verification of 
income.'' Temporary verification may also be obtained through contacts 
with individuals who may be knowledgeable of the person's income. When 
no other verifiable source is available, a written, dated, and signed 
statement, certifying that the disclosed annual gross income of the 
household is accurate to the best knowledge of the tenant or member, may 
be accepted. After normal verification is completed, any needed 
adjustment in tenant or member contribution can be made and recorded on 
the certification and when appropriate, the lease or occupancy 
agreement.
    b  When a tenant or member decides to continue occupancy after 
giving indication of vacating the project and insufficient time remains 
to complete the verification of income or when an employer fails to 
return a verification of income on time, the procedure of F 10 a of this 
paragraph may be followed.
    c  When a delay is caused by circumstances beyond the control of the 
tenant or landlord, such as when delays are encountered in receiving 
verification of income, employment, etc., from third party sources, the 
procedure of F 10 a of this paragraph may be followed.
    G  Mid-month tenant or member certification. The certification 
effective date for a tenant or member starting occupancy on a day other 
than the first day of the month shall be the first day of the following 
month. Certification shall be completed according to paragraph VII F of 
this exhibit.
    H  Resolution of suspected inaccurate information. Should forms, 
interviews, unit inspections, complaints, or other information bring 
into question the accuracy or reasonableness of information relied upon 
to qualify the residents for occupancy or benefits, it should be further 
explored and resolved by the owner and/or management agent. Should the 
matter remain unsolved, the borrower or management agent may forward a 
report to the Agency along with a recommendation for further action. The 
Agency may evaluate such material to determine whether further

[[Page 250]]

action is warranted. Such actions may include those authorized under 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instructions 2012-
B, 1940-M, or subpart N of part 1951 of this chapter (available in any 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    VIII  Lease Agreements, Occupancy Agreements, Rules, and Other 
Tenant Information: A lease agreement is a written contract between a 
tenant and landlord assuring the tenant quiet, peaceful enjoyment and 
exclusive possession of a specific dwelling unit in return for payment 
of rent and reasonable use and protection of the property. The contract 
between a cooperative member and the cooperative is called an occupancy 
agreement. Should the provisions of any lease or occupancy agreement be 
in violation of any State or local law, it may be modified to the extent 
needed to comply with the law; however, the change should be as 
consistent as possible with the provisions set out herein.
    A  Form of lease or occupancy agreement. Each State Director is 
encouraged to prepare a sample lease form complying with individual 
State laws and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
requirements. Occupancy agreements for cooperatives are to be prepared 
in accordance with applicable State laws and subpart E of part 1944 of 
this chapter. The State Director may incorporate clauses which meet a 
specific need in compliance with State law. Any sample lease must be 
reviewed and approved by the OGC before being provided to borrowers as a 
guide for preparing an acceptable project lease.
    1  All leases will be in writing. Initial leases for units for which 
tenants are eligible must cover a period of 1 year. If the tenant is not 
subject to termination of occupancy according to paragraph XIV A of this 
exhibit, a renewal lease, or an addendum of lease extension, shall cover 
a period of 1 year. Leases for LH may be for shorter periods where 
occupancy is typically seasonal. Leases for all tenants signed after 
notification of intent to prepay, but prior to prepayment, may be for a 
term which ends on the date of prepayment. Leases for tenants who 
entered a project with a Letter of Priority Entitlement and who are 
temporarily occupying a unit for which they are not occupancy eligible, 
will have the clause in paragraph VIII C 1 of this exhibit inserted to 
deal with their obligation to move when an eligible unit becomes 
available.
    2  Leases and occupancy agreements must contain an appropriate 
escalation clause permitting changes in basic and/or note rate rents or 
occupancy charges prior to the expiration of the document. Such changes 
would normally be necessary due to changing utility and other operating 
costs. Any changes must be approved by FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 according to exhibit C of this subpart. Leases 
must specify that no increases in tenant contribution to rent will take 
place due to prepayment of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 loan during the term of the lease. Leases must also state 
that should any Federal subsidies paid to the borrower on behalf of 
tenants be suspended or canceled, due to a monetary or nonmonetary 
default by the borrower, the monetary payment made by the tenant to the 
borrower (or, when applicable, the monetary payment received by the 
tenant from the borrower) shall not change over that which would have 
been required had the subsidy remained in place.
    3  Pursuant to the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, no provision 
may be incorporated into a lease that would prohibit:
    a  Occupancy by families with children under 18 years of age. As 
applied to housing designated as elderly, those residing with the 
elderly household who are under 18 years of age may not be excluded 
under the terms of the lease.
    b  Occupancy by a person with a handicap who is willing and able to 
make reasonable modifications to an apartment unit, at the tenant's 
expense, to afford such person full enjoyment of the apartment. The 
owner may include in the lease, where reasonable, permission to occupy 
the apartment on the condition the tenant agrees to restore the interior 
of the apartment to the condition that existed before any modifications, 
reasonable wear and tear excepted.
    4  In areas where there is a concentration of non-English speaking 
individuals in the project or in the community, leases or occupancy 
agreements and the established rules and regulations for the project 
written in both plain English and the appropriate non-English language 
must be available to the tenants or members. The tenant or member should 
have the opportunity to examine and execute either form of lease or 
occupancy agreement.
    5   The form of lease or occupancy agreement to be used by the 
borrower and any modifications of the same must be approved by the FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official. 
When submitting a lease or occupancy agreement form for FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval, it must be 
accompanied by a letter from a practicing attorney licensed in the State 
regarding its legal sufficiency and compliance with State law and FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 regulations.
    6   A copy of a properly completed and approved exhibit A-6 of 
subpart E of part 1944 (when the tenant or member will pay utilities) 
and a copy of the established rules and regulations for the project will 
be provided to the tenant or member as attachments to the lease or 
occupancy agreement.

[[Page 251]]

    7   A copy of a properly completed and signed Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 or HUD Form 50059 or 
other HUD approved form for those tenants receiving HUD section 8 tenant 
subsidy will be used to calculate each tenant's contribution and will be 
provided to the tenant as an attachment to the lease.
    B  Required lease or occupancy agreement clauses. The following 
clauses will be required in leases used in connection with FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354-financed housing projects. 
Only clauses in paragraphs VIII B 1, VIII B 4 b, VIII B 4 d, VIII B 4 e, 
VIII B 5, and VIII B 7 of this exhibit are applicable to cooperative 
occupancy agreements.
    1   All lease and occupancy agreements must include a statement 
indicating that the project is financed by FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 and is subject to nondiscrimination provisions 
of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title VIII of the Fair 
Housing Act, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Age 
Discrimination Act of 1975; and that all complaints are to be directed 
to the Administrator, FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354, USDA, Washington, DC 20250. However, complaints of Fair Housing 
violations may be sent directly to the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development, Washington, DC 20410.
    2   All lease agreements must specify that should the unit become 
overcrowded or underutilized or should the tenant no longer meet the 
eligibility requirements of the project during the term of the lease 
agreement, he/she will be required to vacate the unit at the end of the 
lease term unless eligibility can be established following specified 
steps, such as moving to an appropriate size unit, or an exception is 
granted by management.
    3   All lease agreements must contain a provision that a tenant 
household's tenancy still exists during the time that the tenant 
household's personal possessions remain in the apartment unit after the 
tenant household has personally ceased occupancy with the intent to 
vacate and leave the project, until such time the personal possessions 
have been removed voluntarily or by legal means, subject to the 
provision of State or local law in such matters.
    4   All leases used in FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354-financed RRH projects must include the following clauses except 
for persons who are elderly, disabled, or handicapped living in a full 
profit plan project unless otherwise noted. (Cooperative occupancy 
agreements must include the clauses contained in paragraphs VIII B 4 b, 
VIII B 4 d, and VIII B 4 e of this exhibit.)
    a   ``I understand that I will no longer be eligible for occupancy 
in this project if my income exceeds the maximum allowable adjusted 
income as defined periodically by the Farmers Home Administration or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for the (State/Territory).''
    b   ``I agree I must immediately notify the [landlord or 
cooperative] when there is a change in my gross income or adjustment to 
income, or when there is a change in the number of persons living in the 
household. I understand my rent or benefits may be affected as a result 
of this information. I also understand that failure to report such 
changes may result in my losing benefits to which I may be entitled or 
may result in the [landlord or cooperative] taking corrective action if 
benefits were mistakenly received. I understand the corrective action 
the [landlord or cooperative] may take includes the initiation of a 
demand for repayment of any benefits or rental subsidies improperly 
received, initiation of a notice to cancel any rental assistance or 
section 8 assistance being received for the balance of my certification 
period, initiation of a notice to increase my monthly rent to $____ per 
month (note rate rent for Plan II projects or 125 percent of rent in 
Plan I projects), or initiation or a notice of termination. I understand 
that one or more of these remedies may be initiated at the option of the 
[landlord or cooperative].''
    c   ``I understand that I must promptly notify the lessor of any 
extended absences and that if I do not personally reside in the unit for 
a period exceeding 60 consecutive days, for reasons other than health or 
emergency, my net monthly tenant contribution shall be raised to $____ 
per month (note rate rent for Plan II projects or 125 percent of rent in 
Plan I projects) for the period of my absence exceeding 60 consecutive 
days. I also understand that should any rental assistance be suspended 
or reassigned to other eligible tenants, I am not assured that it will 
still be available to me upon my return. I also understand that if my 
absence continues, that as landlord, you may take the appropriate steps 
to terminate my tenancy.''
    d  ``I understand that should I receive occupancy benefits to which 
I am not entitled due to my/our failure to provide information or due to 
incorrect information provided by me or on my behalf by others, or for 
any other household member, I may be required to make restitution and I 
agree to repay any amount of benefits to which I was not entitled.''
    e  ``I understand that income certification is a requirement of 
occupancy and I agree to promptly provide any certifications and income 
verifications required by the owner or cooperative board to permit 
determination of eligibility and, when applicable, the monthly tenant or 
member contribution to be charged.''

[[Page 252]]

    5  Leases and occupancy agreements used by borrowers participating 
in the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 RA program 
will contain the following clauses. (These clauses can be made an 
addendum to the lease and they must be signed by the lessor and lessee):
    ``I understand and agree that as long as I receive rental 
assistance, my gross monthly contribution (as determined on the latest 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8, which 
must be attached to this lease) for rent or occupancy charge and 
utilities will be $____. If I pay any or all utilities directly (not 
including telephone or cable TV), a utility allowance of $____ will be 
deducted from my gross monthly contribution and my resulting net monthly 
contribution will be $____. If my net monthly contribution would be less 
than zero, the lessor will pay me $____.
    I also understand and agree that my monthly contribution under this 
lease or occupancy agreement may be raised or lowered, based on changes 
in the household income or adjustments to income, failure to submit 
information necessary to certify income, changes in the number and age 
of persons living in the household, and on the escalation clause in this 
contract. Should I no longer receive rental assistance as a result of 
these changes, or the rental assistance agreement executed by the [owner 
or cooperative] and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 expires, I understand and agree that my monthly contribution may be 
adjusted to no less than $____ (basic) nor more than $____ (note rate) 
during the remaining term of this [lease or occupancy agreement], except 
that based on the escalation clause in this contract these rates may be 
changed by a Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 approved rent or occupancy charge change.''

[Note No. 1: Eligible borrowers with LH loans and grants, Plan I direct 
RRH or insured RRH loans approved before August 1, 1968, may omit the 
words ``no less than $____ (Basic) nor more than'' from the last 
sentence of the above statement.]

    ``I understand that every effort will be made to provide rental 
assistance so long as I remain eligible and the rental assistance 
agreement between the [owner or cooperative] and FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 remains in effect. However, should this 
assistance be terminated I may arrange to terminate this contract, 
giving proper notice as set forth elsewhere in this [lease or occupancy 
agreement].''

[Note No. 2: The following additional clause is needed by those 
borrowers with Plan I direct or insured RRH loans approved before August 
1, 1968.]

    ``I further agree that should I be permitted to occupy when my 
income exceeds maximum limits, I shall pay a 25 percent rental rate 
surcharge in addition to my rental rate of $____.''
    6  For leases with tenants occupying units in which borrowers are 
operating under Plan I either with or without interest credit approved 
on or after August 1, 1968:
    ``I understand and agree that my rent rate of $____ (includes) 
(excludes) my cost of utilities. I further understand and agree that 
should I be permitted to occupy when my income exceeds maximum limits, I 
shall pay a 25 percent rental rate surcharge in addition to my rental 
rate.''
    7  For leases or occupancy agreements in projects which borrowers 
are operating under Plan II Interest Credit Only:
    ``I understand and agree that my gross monthly contribution as 
determined on the latest Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-8, which must be attached to this contract, for [rent 
or occupancy charge] and utilities will be $____.
    If I pay any or all utilities directly (not including telephone or 
cable TV), a utility allowance of $____ will be deducted from my gross 
monthly [rent or occupancy charge] except that I will pay not less than 
the basic rent nor more than the note rate [rent or occupancy charge] 
stated below. My net monthly [rent or occupancy charge] will be $____. I 
understand that should I receive rental subsidy benefits (interest 
credit) to which I am not entitled, I may be required to make 
restitution and I agree to pay any amount of benefit to which I was not 
entitled. I also understand and agree that my monthly tenant [rent or 
occupancy charge] under this [lease or occupancy agreement] may be 
raised or lowered based on changes in the household income, failure to 
submit information necessary to certify income, changes in the number 
and age of persons living in the household, and on the escalation clause 
in this contract. My [rent or occupancy charge] will not, however, be 
less than $____ (basic) nor more than $____ (note rate) during the term 
of this contract, except that based on the escalation clause in this 
[lease or occupancy agreement], these rental rates or occupancy charges 
may be changed by a Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 approved [rent or occupancy charge] change.''
    8  Leases used by borrowers with LH loans and/or grants will use the 
following additional clauses:
    a  ``I understand that the project is operated and maintained for 
the purpose of providing housing for domestic farm laborers and their 
immediate families. I do hereby certify that a substantial portion of my 
immediate family income is and will be derived from farm labor. I 
further understand that

[[Page 253]]

domestic farm labor means persons who receive a substantial portion of 
their income as laborers on farms in the United States and either are 
citizens of the United States, or reside in the United States, Puerto 
Rico, or the Virgin Islands, after being legally admitted for permanent 
residence therein, and may include the immediate families of such 
persons. Laborers on farms may include laborers engaged in handling 
agricultural commodities while in the unprocessed stage. It also 
includes labor for the production of aquatic organisms under a 
controlled or selected environment.''
    b  ``I agree that if my household income ceases to be substantially 
from farm labor for reasons other than disability or retirement, I will 
vacate my dwelling after proper notification by the owner.''
    9  All leases, including all renewal leases, shall contain the 
following clause:
    ``It is understood that the use, attempted use, or possession, 
manufacture, sale, or distribution of an illegal controlled substance 
(as defined by local, State, or federal law) while in or on any part of 
this apartment complex or cooperative is an illegal act. It is further 
understood that such action is a material lease violation. Such 
violations (hereafter called a ``drug violation'') may be evidenced upon 
the admission to or conviction of a drug violation.
    The landlord may require any lessee or other adult member of the 
tenant household occupying the unit (or other adult or nonadult person 
outside the tenant household who is using the unit) who commits a drug 
violation to vacate the leased unit permanently, within timeframes set 
by the landlord, and not thereafter enter upon the landlord's premises 
or the lessee unit without the landlord's prior consent as a condition 
for continued occupancy by members of the tenant household. The landlord 
may deny consent for entry unless the person agrees to not commit a drug 
violation in the future and is either actively participating in a 
counseling or recovery program, complying with court orders related to a 
drug violation, or completed a counseling or recovery program.
    The landlord may require any lessee to show evidence that any 
nonadult member of the tenant household occupying the unit, who 
committed a drug violation, agrees to not commit a drug violation in the 
future, and to show evidence that the person is either actively seeking 
or receiving assistance through a counseling or recovery program, 
complying with court orders related to a drug violation, completed a 
counseling or recovery program within timeframes specified by the 
landlord as a condition for continued occupancy in the unit. Should a 
further drug violation be committed by any nonadult person occupying the 
unit the landlord may require the person to be severed from tenancy as a 
condition for continued occupancy by the lessee.
    If a person vacating the unit, as a result of the above policies, is 
one of the lessees, the person shall be severed from the tenancy and the 
lease shall continue among any other remaining lessees and the landlord. 
The landlord may also, at the option of the landlord, permit another 
adult member of the household to be a lessee.
    Should any of the above provisions governing a drug violation be 
found to violate any of the laws of the land the remaining enforceable 
provisions shall remain in effect. The provisions set out above do not 
supplant any rights of tenants afforded by law.
    C  Special lease clause.
    1  Handicapped accessible units occupied by those not needing 
specially designed features. A clause should be used in addition to the 
required clauses in the special situation where management temporarily 
assigns a nonhandicapped households to occupy a handicapped accessible 
unit specially designed for handicapped households under the conditions 
of paragraph VI D 2 g of this exhibit. Any agreements between the 
landlord and the tenant concerning who bears the costs of moving to 
another suitably sized vacant unit should be documented.
    ``I/we acknowledge that I/we am/are occupying a designated 
handicapped accessible unit. I/we acknowledge that priority for such 
units is given to those needing special physical design features. I/we 
acknowledge that I/we am/are permitted to occupy the unit until 
management issues a notice that a priority applicant is on the waiting 
list and that I/we must move to another suitably sized vacant unit in 
the project. Upon receiving this notice, I/we agree to move at [my/our 
own] [shared (as agreed)] [project] expense within 30 calendar days to 
the suitably sized vacant unit within the project, if one is available. 
I/we further understand my/our rental rate will change, when 
appropriate, to the rental rate for the unit I/we move to and this lease 
will be modified accordingly.''
    2  Prepayment subject to restrictive-use covenants. Upon FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval and acceptance of a 
prepayment, subject to restrictive-use covenants, the landlord will 
ensure all existing tenant leases and renewals of such leases are 
amended to include the following provisions:
    ``As a condition of the Government's approval of a request to accept 
early payment on notes owed, the tenant household is protected, to the 
extent herein disclosed, against involuntary displacement (except for 
good cause) and against having the tenant household contribution level 
(rent) materially increased until [insert a date 20 years from the date 
of the last FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan 
or servicing action making the loan subject

[[Page 254]]

to prepayment restrictions, or insert ``the tenant household decides to 
move'' depending on the restrictive-use provision accepted by the owner 
(see Sec. 1965.215(e)(5) of subpart E of part 1965 of this chapter)]. 
Specifically, the tenant household contribution level (rent) must be 
consistent with those necessary to maintain the project for low- and 
moderate-income tenants. Those tenant households whose tenant household 
contribution level (rent) did not exceed 30 percent of their monthly 
adjusted income at the time the prepayment was accepted, may have their 
tenant household contribution level (rent) raised to the lesser of 30 
percent of their monthly adjusted income or 10 percent of their gross 
monthly income per year. Those tenant households whose tenant household 
contribution level (rent) exceeded 30 percent of their monthly adjusted 
income at the time the prepayment was accepted, may have their tenant 
household contribution level (rent) raised to the lesser of the latest 
U.S. Consumer Price Index or 10 percent per year.''
    D  Other lease provisions. All leases or occupancy agreements must 
contain provisions covering:
    1  Names of the parties to the contract and all individuals to 
reside in the unit and the identification of the unit.
    2  The amount and due date of monthly contributions.
    3  Any penalty for late payment of monthly contributions according 
to paragraph IX B of this exhibit.
    4  The utilities and quantities thereof and the services and 
equipment to be furnished to the tenant or member by the management or 
cooperative and the tenant's or member's responsibility to pay utility 
charges promptly when due.
    5  The process by which contribution and eligibility for occupancy 
shall be determined and redetermined including:
    a  The frequency of such contribution and eligibility 
determinations.

determine whether the project provides the services requested by the 
applicant/tenant and/or to determine how to best serve the applicant's/
tenant's/member's request with reasonable accommodation, referral 
services, etc. In the case of a group home, the information may also 
include an assessment by a professional medical examiner or 
practitioner, social service caseworker, representative of an advocacy 
group, member of the clergy, etc., that the tenant/applicant provides to 
support the application or recertification for housing and services.
    c  The standards by which rents or occupancy charge, eligibility, 
and appropriate dwelling unit size shall be determined.
    d  Tenant's household agreement to move to a unit of appropriate 
size if the household size changes.
    e  The circumstances under which a tenant or member may request a 
redetermination of tenant contribution.

    10  The responsibility of management or cooperative to provide the 
tenant or member with a written statement of the condition of the 
dwelling unit (when the tenant or member initially enters into occupancy 
and when vacating the dwelling unit), and the conditions under which the 
tenant or member may participate in the inspection of the premises which 
is the basis for such statement.
    11  The circumstances under which management or the cooperative may 
enter the premises during the tenant's or member's possession thereof,

    15  The formalities that shall be observed by management or the 
cooperative and the tenant or member in giving notice one to the other 
as may be called for under the terms of the lease or occupancy

community, or after notification by RRH borrower of intent to prepay. 
The prior notice on which a cooperative member may cancel an occupancy 
agreement for ``good cause'' shall be 4 months.
    21  The usual signature clause attesting that the lease or occupancy 
agreement has been executed by the parties.
    E  Prohibited lease or occupancy agreement clauses. Clauses in the 
classifications listed below shall not be included in any lease or 
occupancy agreement.
    1  Confession of judgment. Prior consent by tenant or member to any 
lawsuit the landlord or board may bring against the tenant or member in 
connection with the lease or occupancy agreement and to a judgment in 
favor of the landlord or board.
    2  Distraint for rental or occupancy charge or other charges. 
Authorization to the landlord or cooperative board to take property of

member has failed to perform.
    3  Exculpatory clause. Agreement by tenant or member not to hold the 
landlord or landlord's agents or cooperative board liable for any acts 
or omissions whether intentional or negligent on the part of the

member that the suit had been filed.
    5  Waiver of legal proceedings. Authorization to the landlord or 
board to evict the tenant or member or hold or sell the tenant's or 
member's possessions whenever the landlord or board determines that a 
breach or default has occurred.
    6  Waiver of jury trail. Authorization to the landlord's or board's 
lawyer to appear in court for the tenant or member and to waive the 
tenant's or member's right to trail by jury.
    7  Waiver of right to appeal judicial error in legal proceedings.

    8  Tenant or member chargeable with costs or legal actions 
regardless of outcome. Agreement by the tenant or member to pay 
attorney's fees or other legal costs whenever the landlord or board 
decides to take action against the tenant or member even though the 
court finds in favor of the tenant or member. (Omission of this clause 
does not mean that the tenant or member, as a party to a lawsuit, may 
not be obligated to pay attorney's fees or other costs if the tenant or 
member loses the suit.)
    F  Modification of lease or occupancy agreement and notification to 
tenants or members. The landlord or board may modify the terms and 
conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement with FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 prior consent, effective at 
the end of the initial term or a successive term, by serving an 
appropriate notice on the tenant or members, together with the tender of 
a revised lease or occupancy agreement or an addendum revising the 
existing lease or occupancy agreement. This notice and tender shall be 
delivered to the tenant or member either by first-class mail, properly 
stamped and addressed or hand-delivered to the premises to an adult 
member of the household. The date on which the notice shall be deemed to 
be received by the tenant or member shall be the date on which the 
first-class letter is mailed or the date on which the copy of the notice 
is delivered to the premises. The notice must be received at least 30 
days prior to the last date on which the tenant or member has the right 
to terminate the occupancy without executing the revised lease or 
occupancy agreement. The notice must advise the tenants or members that 
they may appeal modifications to the lease or occupancy agreement in

[[Page 256]]

accordance with subpart L of part 1944 of this chapter if the 
modification will result in a denial, substantial reduction, or 
termination of benefits being received. The same notification will be 
applicable to any changes in the rules and regulations for the project.
    G  Occupancy rules and informative material. Occupancy rules 
establish the basis for the management-tenant or member relationship. 
Occupancy rules and regulations must be provided and explained by the 
project management to enable the tenant or member to understand the 
purposes, objectives, and standards of the project. The rules will be 
approved by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
State Director or designee, generally together with the project 
management plan, management agreement, and lease or occupancy agreement 
form.
    1  All rules for occupancy and rent or occupancy charge structures 
will be in writing posted conspicuously in the borrower's and/or 
manager's offices and provided to each tenant or member with the lease 
or occupancy agreement.
    2  Proposed changes of any rules for occupancy must be made 
available to each tenant or member at least 30 days in advance of 
implementation, and tenants or members must be advised that they may 
appeal changes in accordance with FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 tenant grievance and appeals procedure subpart L of 
part 1944 of this chapter.
    3  Landlords or cooperatives may not place unreasonable restrictions 
on residents desiring to use federally financed community rooms for 
their enjoyment. No rule may infringe on the rights of the rental 
tenants to organize an association of tenants. Such associations may be 
organized to bargain with management, as well as to act socially and/or 
provide for the welfare of its members. The project management person or 
organization should be available and willing to work with a tenant 
organization. Examples of unreasonable restrictions include rules 
requiring management representatives to be present in order to use 
community rooms, rules barring tenant or cooperative organizational 
meetings from using the rooms, or rules requiring management 
representatives to be present at any resident organizational meeting 
held in community rooms.
    4  Rules may be promulgated that prohibit activities which are 
detrimental to management, tenants and members. Such activities include 
threats to the health or safety of other tenants or members or the 
employees of the borrower, interference with the quiet enjoyment of the 
premises by other tenants or members, or damage to the physical 
structure of the project.
    5  The borrower may choose to provide rules for nonelderly projects 
that either permit or exclude pets except that no rules may be 
promulgated that would prohibit the occupancy of a household member who 
requires the services of a service animal to achieve the normal function 
of that household member.
    6  For each RRH project or portion of a project specifically 
designated for the elderly, the borrower must have established project 
rules permitting elderly, handicapped, or disabled tenants to keep 
commonly accepted household pets. These pet rules are to be governed by 
the following guidelines:
    a  Pet rules must not:
    (1) Prohibit, prevent, restrict, or discriminate against any tenant 
who owns or keeps a pet in their apartment unit, with respect to 
continued occupancy in the project unless the approved project pet rules 
are violated.
    (2) Prohibit, prevent, restrict, or discriminate against any 
applicant who owns a pet with respect to obtaining occupancy in the 
project.
    (3) Charge an extra monthly rental charge for pets.
    b  Borrowers with operational projects must consult with the tenants 
of the project when revising pet rules and retain documentation on how 
the consultation process was conducted.
    c.  Borrowers with new projects will establish pet rules prior to 
occupancy, but may revise those rules based on tenant comments and 
suggestions received after rent-up begins.
    d  Pet rules will be approved by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 as part of, or an amendment to, the project lease. 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval will be 
granted when the rules meet the provisions and intent of this 
subparagraph.
    e  Pet rules will be reasonable and will be written to consider at 
the least the following factors:
    (1) Density of project units.
    (2) Pet size.
    (3) Type of pet.
    (4) Potential financial obligations of tenants who own or keep pets.
    (5) Standards of pet care.
    (6) Pet exercise areas.
    (7) State and local animal laws or ordinances.
    (8) Liability insurance.
    f  Pet rules must allow the borrower or project manager 
authorization to remove from the project any pet whose conduct or 
condition is duly determined to constitute a nuisance or threat to the 
health or safety of other tenants or members in the project or persons 
in the surrounding community.
    7  Initial rules will be attached to the lease or occupancy 
agreement. Approval by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 for changers and additions may be requested as needed.

[[Page 257]]

    8  The following items illustrate areas that are among those which 
should be addressed in rules or informative materials developed by 
management and provided to all tenants or members prior to move-in:
    a  Explanation of rights and responsibilities under the lease or 
occupancy agreement. Where a non-English language is common to a project 
area, a lease or occupancy agreement written in that language should 
also be provided.
    b  Rent payment or occupancy charge policies and procedures should 
be fully explained.
    c  Policy on periodic inspection of units.
    d  Responding to tenant or member complaints.
    e  Maintenance request procedure.
    f  Project services and facilities available to tenants or members.
    g  Office location, hours, and emergency telephone numbers.
    h  Map showing location of community facilities including schools, 
health care, libraries, parks, etc.
    i  Restrictions on storage and prohibition against abandoning 
vehicles in the project area.
    j  A rental project newsletter or other printed material distributed 
to potential tenants or the public. If a newsletter or other printed 
material is desired, it must contain an appropriate nondiscrimination 
statement, or fair housing slogan or logotype.
    k  Community and public transportation schedules.
    9  Tenant or member may be permitted to have a guest(s) visit their 
household. However, the landlord reserves the right to request a 
recorded declaration of domicile or proof of domicile if it is suspected 
that the guest is an unauthorized household occupant. Such suspicion may 
arise whenever an adult person(s) is making reoccurring visits or one 
continuous visit of 14 days and/or nights in a 45-day period without 
prior notification of the management. Should the tenant or person in 
question not provide the requested information needed to confirm other 
domicile, or should the facts be sufficient to evidence domicile in the 
project, then the landlord may consider such person(s) a member of the 
tenant household and may enforce any lease covenants shown to be broken 
and/or require recertification.
    10  No provisions may be incorporated into occupancy rules that 
would discriminate against or otherwise deny equal opportunity to any 
person (whether the tenant or a person associated with the tenant) in 
the terms, conditions, or privileges of rental of a dwelling unit, or in 
the provision for services or facilities in connection wherewith, 
because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, National origin, 
or handicap.
    11  The borrower must establish and enforce rules to ensure there 
are reasonable accommodations to persons who are handicapped or 
disabled.
    H  Security deposits.
    1  Security deposits are encouraged and they should be used when it 
is reasonable and customary for the area for assurance of rental payment 
or charges for damages. The amount of security deposits must be 
reflected in the borrower's management plan and may not be changed 
without the written consent of the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official. When security deposits are used, 
they should not exceed an amount equal to the net tenant contribution 
for one month or basic rent, whichever is greater. Families receiving a 
HUD rental subsidy will pay security deposits according to HUD 
requirements. In an elderly project, the amount of additional security 
deposit for pets must be reasonable and not designed to prohibit or 
discourage tenancy but in no case should it exceed the basic rent of the 
project. Where a service animal is necessary for the normal function of 
a household member, an additional security deposit for the animal may 
not be charged. A membership fee, equal to one month's occupancy charge, 
will be required from members of a cooperative.
    2  Security deposits for persons eligible for RA or Section 8 
assistance shall be administered in a manner to prevent hardship on the 
household. If such tenants or members cannot pay the full amount 
initially, they may be given terms that may ordinarily:
    a  For RRH projects, not exceed a downpayment of 30 percent of 
adjusted monthly income plus $15 per month or that amount needed monthly 
to complete the security deposit within 3 months, whichever is greater 
(landlords may provide payment over longer terms if desired). For RCH 
projects, not exceed an initial payment of $25 plus the amount needed 
monthly to complete the membership fee within 3 months (longer terms may 
be permitted if desired by the project). Should installments not be met, 
the total security deposit charge may become due and payable in full.
    b  For low-income farmworkers in an LH project, not exceed $25 
downpayment and $15 per month until an equivalent of one month's project 
rent is reached. In the case of migrants who will occupy the units for a 
short period of time, exception to this policy by FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 may be made upon written request from 
the borrower when it is shown that such deposits need to be raised to 
protect the interest of the government and it will not create a hardship 
on the tenants.
    3  Security deposits or membership fees shall be handled in 
accordance with any State or local laws governing security deposits. 
Both security deposits and membership

[[Page 258]]

fees shall be deposited in a separate account when required by State or 
local law, and such funds must be held in a Federally insured 
institution, and shall be handled in accordance with any State or local 
laws governing such deposits. Funds in the security deposit account 
shall only be used for authorized purposes as intended and represented 
by the project management in the management plan, and until so used, 
shall be held by the borrower in trust for the respective tenants. Funds 
in the membership fee account shall only be used for authorized 
purposes, until so used, shall be held by the borrower in trust for the 
respective members.
    4  Borrowers may assess fair and reasonable charges to the security 
deposit or membership fee for damage and loss caused or allowed by the 
tenant or member. An itemized accounting for such charges must be 
presented to the tenant or member after the move-out inspection provided 
for in paragraph X E 2 of this exhibit, unless the tenant or member has 
abandoned the property and his/her whereabouts are unknown and cannot be 
ascertained after reasonable inquiry.
    5  The owner may not increase, for persons with handicaps, any 
customarily required security or membership fee deposit for restoration 
made to earlier modifications that permitted the handicapped person's 
full enjoyment of the dwelling unit. However, where it is necessary in 
order to ensure with reasonable certainty that funds will be available 
to pay for the restoration(s) at the end of the occupancy, the borrower 
may negotiate as part of such a restoration agreement, a provision 
requiring that the tenant or member pay into an interest bearing escrow 
account, over a reasonable period, a reasonable amount of money not to 
exceed the cost of the restoration(s). The interest in any such account 
shall accrue to the benefit of the tenant or member.
    I  Leases for Section 8 and Section 8 Rental Certificate or Rental 
Voucher tenants/members. Guidance on leases for such tenants/members is 
set out herein; however, the use of any addendum necessary to meet the 
requirements of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, 
HUD, or other provider of subsidy or assistance as needed to comply with 
the requirements of any such other program, may be used as needed. 
Whenever conflicts or disputes arise, the servicing office may forward a 
request for guidance to the State Director, along with any 
recommendation. The State Director may take those actions necessary to 
resolve the issue with the advice and consent of the Office of the 
General Counsel.
    1  Borrowers/Management agents are encouraged to use HUD approved 
lease agreements. Evidence of HUD's approval should be contained in the 
borrower casefile.
    2  The HUD approved lease must include modifications of addenda that 
meet the conditions or requirements of paragraphs VIII A, B1, B2, and B3 
of this subpart.
    3  An FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354-approved 
lease may also be used when acceptable by HUD and the local housing 
authority when this option proves more practical.
    IX  Rent or Occupancy Charge Collection and Account Servicing: Rents 
or occupancy charges should be due on the first day of each month of the 
lease period. The time and place of on-site collection and/or the 
correct address for payment by mail should be well publicized and 
consideration should be given to an after-hours depository if needed.
    A  Receipts. A form of serially-numbered receipts should be selected 
for use and the collection agent held accountable for every receipt. 
Optional collection services may be considered when they are available.
    B  Delinquencies. A system to identify and detect unpaid rents or 
occupancy charges within the project should be instituted in the 
management plan and made known to tenants in their lease. The borrower 
may adopt the late rental payment penalty and grace period prescribed by 
State law; otherwise, they may not exceed a grace period of 10 days from 
the rental or occupancy charge due date and not have the late payment 
penalty exceed the highest of:
    1  An amount up to $10 after the grace period, or
    2  An amount equal to 5 percent of the tenant's gross tenant 
contribution (GTC) (found at line 30 of Form 1944-8) after the grace 
period,
    3  Any late payment policy established should address unusual 
situations such as tenants receiving income from Social Security, 
pension and retirement type funds that tenants receive routinely in the 
few days following the first day of a month. A 5-day grace period 
following the usual receipt date of such payment could be permitted.
    4  The plan should also address any provisions for waivers of late 
payment penalty, if appropriate
    C  Recapture of improperly advanced RA and interest credit. 
Recapture of improperly advanced RA and interest credit will be 
processed in accordance with subpart N of part 1951 of this chapter.
    D  Project late fees on Predetermined Amortization Schedule System 
(PASS) accounts.
    1  Project late fees are charged on PASS account loan payments not 
received by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 by 
close of business of the 10th day of the month as further described in 
Sec. 1951.510(c)(2) of subpart K of part 1951 of this chapter.
    2  A borrower may request in writing a waiver of a late fee 
according to Sec. 1951.510(c)(2) of subpart K of part 1951 of this

[[Page 259]]

chapter. Borrowers may appeal a denial of a request for a late fee 
waiver under the Agency's uniform appeal procedures set out in subpart B 
of part 1900 of this chapter.
    3  Late fee waivers are determined to be a benefit to the borrower 
entity and must be reported to IRS by the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 Finance Office.
    4  If the cause of the late fee is an FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 accounting system error, the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 may suspend sending monthly 
billings to the borrower until the error is corrected. If delinquency 
persists after correcting the error, late fees will be charged. Late 
fees charged as a result of FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 error will be administratively corrected and not reported to 
IRS by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Finance 
Office.
    5  Except for cooperatives, project late fees are not a project 
expense. Borrowers shall record a line item entry on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 showing late fees, 
offset by an equal transfer-in of the borrower's own funds or a 
reduction of the borrower's return to owner.
    X  Maintenance: Maintenance is the process by which a project is 
kept up in all respects and includes land, buildings, and equipment. 
Maintenance responsibilities will be included in the management plan. 
Proper maintenance will help to keep a good image for the project, help 
to minimize vacancies, and help to preserve the project. Plans and 
policies for inspections, effective maintenance and repair are to be 
established at the outset and modified periodically as needed. The 
following types of maintenance are necessary:
    A  Routine maintenance. Routine maintenance and repairs will be 
those cost items and services included in the annual budgets to be paid 
out of the operations and maintenance expense account. It includes 
regular maintenance tasks of the project that can be prescheduled or 
planned for, based on equipment availability and property 
characteristics tasks performed on a regular basis to maintain the 
appearance of the project and to prevent an accumulation of debris and 
subsequent deterioration.
    B  Responsive maintenance. This includes all maintenance tasks 
performed in response to either requests for service from tenants or 
members or unplanned breakdowns. An essential part of any maintenance 
system is to plan for requests coming from the dwelling units and for 
emergencies occurring in the systems serving the apartments. The project 
manager or the cooperative's board of directors should develop a plan to 
focus on: who receives the requests, how they are handled, how specific 
employees or members are assigned to the tasks, and what kind of records 
are kept. The capacity of the project manager or board to respond to 
requests and emergencies is one of the true tests of a successful 
maintenance program.
    C  Preventive maintenance. This is similar to inspection type 
maintenance. Regular checking and servicing of equipment and systems is 
done as required by service information. Preventive maintenance of 
mechanical systems, building exteriors, elevators, and heating and 
cooling systems in projects require specially trained personnel. The 
project manager should establish biweekly or monthly schedules in which 
the routine oiling, adjusting, replacing of filters, and the like is 
done based on manufacturer's manuals and specifications.
    D  Long-term maintenance and replacement (curable depreciation). 
These are major expense items which normally do not occur on an annual 
basis and cannot be afforded from an annual budget income. These 
expenses include items such as repaving the parking lot or repainting an 
entire building or project; replacement of furnishings and equipment, 
including such items as stoves, refrigerators, carpets, water heaters, 
furnaces, etc., whenever such replacements are beyond the capacity of 
the project to pay out of the normal operating budget. The borrower may 
request permission to use reserve funds to pay for these expenses when 
they occur. However, use of funds out of the reserve account must be 
preapproved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    E  Inspection maintenance. These are maintenance inspections 
performed periodically to discover problems before crisis situations 
develop. The following inspections of each apartment should be made at 
appropriate times:
    1  Move-in inspection. Before move-in occurs, the management and the 
applicant accepted for occupancy should together inspect the unit to be 
occupied and agree upon any needed repairs. A written inspection report 
shall be prepared and a copy retained in the tenant's or member's file. 
Any of the identified deficiencies not corrected prior to occupancy 
should be noted on the lease or occupancy agreement or inspection move-
in report and signed by the tenant or member and borrower's or 
cooperative's representative.
    2  Move-out inspection. An inspection should be scheduled with the 
tenant or member when the management becomes aware that the tenant or 
member is moving out or has vacated the unit. Whenever possible, the 
inspection should be performed after the furniture has been moved out 
and before any portion of the security deposit or membership fee is 
returned to the tenant or member. Any repairs or costs to be charged to 
the tenant or member will be according to the terms of the lease or 
occupancy agreement,

[[Page 260]]

local law, and regulations governing security deposits or membership 
fees in paragraph VIII H of this exhibit.
    3  Periodic inspection. An inspection of this type should be made at 
least annually. The borrower should make provisions in the lease or 
occupancy agreement for periodic inspection of the units as a part of a 
preventive maintenance program.
    XI  Rent or Occupancy Charge and/or Utility Allowance Changes: It 
may be necessary as operating costs and/or revenues fluctuate to 
consider a change of rental or occupancy charge rates and/or utility 
allowance to keep the project viable. Before any change of rates or 
utility allowances may occur, prior written consent of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is required. The procedure to 
request and implement a rental or occupancy charge and/or utility 
allowance change is specifically covered in exhibit C of this subpart.
    XII  Borrower Project Budgets:
    A  Budget development and preparation. Borrowers are responsible for 
developing project budgets using past actual experiences in developing 
realistic forecasts of projected project operations. The budgets must 
reflect realistic income sources, uses and amounts of funds, and allow 
realistic vacancy and contingency factors. Generated funds must be 
sufficient to pay the forecasted operating costs and authorized 
expenditures of the project including reserves and return on investment, 
leaving adequate cash on hand as a normal course of business. When the 
income from typical project operations (operational income) is not 
sufficient to meet the normal project cash requirements, the borrower is 
responsible for reducing expenditures, seeking FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 consent for authorized withdrawals from 
the reserve account, and/or providing other funds (nonoperational funds) 
to meet project budget requirements.
    1  Budgets will be prepared according to the instructions contained 
in Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7.
    2  Borrowers are required to develop a project budget annually.
    3  Budgets will cover a 12-month period selected by the borrower 
that is to be the project fiscal year of operation.
    4  Separate budgets will be developed for each project when the 
borrower owns more than one MFH project.
    5  The priority order of planned and actual budget expenditures will 
be:
    a  Critical operating and maintenance expenses.
    b  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 debt 
service.
    c  Reserve account requirements.
    d  Other authorized expenditures.
    e  Return on owner's investment.
    6  Project funds may not be used for borrower organizational 
expenses, except in the case of a cooperative or a nonprofit 
organization.
    7  When tenants pay their own utilities, an updated or current 
exhibit A-6 to subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter is to accompany 
each budget submitted to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 for approval with justification to either retain or change the 
utility allowance(s).
    8  When planned expenses appear to be excessive (such as when 
expenses at any subtotal level on the budget exceed 5 percent of that 
shown for typical costs for the area) for the area based on current cost 
data, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 budget 
approval official may require justification prior to any approval 
action. Such justifications may include evidence that the cost is in 
line with what others charge for the same or similar services (i.e., 
cost estimates from others, summaries of rental housing revenues and 
expenditures from Agency or third-party sources, etc.). Such evidence 
may also be verified by the Agency at its option. When differences 
cannot be mutually resolved, the request for budget approval may be 
denied and the borrower or the borrower's designated representative will 
be advised of any applicable appeal rights in accordance with subpart B 
of part 1900 of this chapter. Any unapproved expenditure actually paid 
which is clearly in excess of a fair and equitable amount may be 
required to be repaid to the project from any authorized return on 
owner's investment or from nonproject sources, such that tenant rents 
will not be increased.
    B  Return on investments authorized by borrower's RRH loan 
agreement/resolution.
    1   Limited profit borrowers may take the return authorized for the 
project's current budget year without further FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 approval under the following conditions. 
(Note: This does not require delaying taking a return on owner's 
investment pending submission, review and/or action on any required 
audit by Agency officials):
    a  Payment may be only once a year based on the project's financial 
condition as of the end of the project fiscal year. Borrowers are 
encouraged to draw the return on investment in the days or weeks 
immediately following the close of the fiscal year. The return on 
owner's investment must be taken within 9 months of the last day earned, 
except when the circumstances described in paragraph XII B 2 a of this 
exhibit are applicable.
    b  Payment must have been approved as part of the borrower's annual 
budget on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1930-7.
    c  The project must produce income at approved monthly rental rates 
during that

[[Page 261]]

year, which is used to pay for the project expenses in accordance with 
the approved budget and, when appropriate, an approved servicing plan.
    d  The balance in the reserve account must be on schedule less any 
authorized withdrawals not requiring immediate redeposit. The amount of 
reduction of the annual reserve requirement approved as part of a 
servicing plan will be considered like an authorized withdrawal not 
requiring redeposit.
    e  Payment of the return may not produce a negative ending year 
unrestricted cash balance on Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-7.
    2  If income is not adequate in any given fiscal year to cover 
payment of the return to owner, FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 may authorize a well-documented request that the 
return be paid, provided:
    a  The return can be paid from excess funds available at the end of 
the following fiscal year of operation, as long as it does not result in 
a rent increase and the reserve account is current less authorized 
withdrawals. (Noncash losses of the borrower entity do not qualify to be 
recouped in following years.) This option is authorized only for the 
year immediately following the year in which the return was not paid. 
The prior year's return on owner's investment may be taken first, and 
any residual left to apply to the current year's return on owner's 
investment at the borrower's option.
    b  Release of reserve funds at the end of the current budget year 
with Servicing Official approval, if the principles set out in 
paragraphs XII B 1 b, c, and d of this exhibit are met, and further 
provided that:
    (1) The reserve account will not be reduced below the amount 
required to be accumulated by that time considering any previously 
authorized withdrawals or adjustments; and,
    (2) During the next 12 months, the amount in the reserve account 
will not likely fall below that required to be accumulated by the end of 
such 12-month period.
    (3) This option is authorized only for the year immediately 
following the year in which the return was not paid. This does not apply 
to the return on investment waived while a special market rent budget is 
in effect.
    3  Borrowers operating under a servicing (workout) plan and/or using 
special servicing market rate rents that call for less than full debt 
service payment to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
shall forego and cannot recoup the annual return to owner for the budget 
year that such plans or rents are in place.
    4  When the provisions of paragraph XII B 1, 2 of this exhibit are 
not met only because the payment was not earlier approved on Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7, and the 
conditions are such that approval can now be made, an adjusted form may 
be submitted to seek approval of the return on owner's investment.
    5  Should the return to owner be suspected or discovered as being 
improperly taken, the Agency may initiate appropriate servicing actions, 
including using the authorities set out in subpart N of part 1951 of 
this chapter and/or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 Instructions 2012-B and/or 1940-M (available at any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    C  Advancement (loan) of funds to a RRH project by the owner, member 
of the organization, or agent of the owner.
    1  Prior written approval by the Servicing Office is required. Such 
advances may be authorized when justified by unusual short-term 
conditions. When conditions are not short-term in nature, a servicing 
plan may be developed and advances may be approved in accordance with 
the provisions set out in subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter. 
Justification will be based on the following:
    a  A review of the documented circumstances and the project 
operating budget before any funds are advanced (loaned). The financial 
position of the project must not be jeopardized.
    b  Funds are not immediately available from any of the following 
sources:
    (1) Reserve funds
    (2) Initial operating capital
    (3) An imminent rent increase
    2  The funds will be applied to ordinary project operating and 
maintenance expenses.
    3  Interest may be charged or paid on the loan from project income; 
however, interest must be reasonable. The proposal may be denied if FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financing can be 
provided to resolve the problem in a more cost effective manner.
    4  No lien in connection with the loan will be filed against the 
property securing the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 loan or against project income. The advance may show as an unsecured 
project liability on financial statements prepared for year-end reports 
until such time as it is authorized to be repaid.
    5  The payback of the advance (loan) may be permitted by the 
Servicing Official provided the terms and conditions were mutually 
agreed to by the borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 at the time of the advance and the financial position of the 
project will not be jeopardized. Payback should only be permitted on the 
advance when the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
debt is current and the reserve requirements are being maintained at the 
authorized levels.
    D  Special budget planning.

[[Page 262]]

    1  Budgets must be prepared according to the special servicing 
guidelines of subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter when a project is 
experiencing abnormal vacancy or is otherwise detrimentally impacted by 
economic reversal in the community.
    2  The borrower is responsible for obtaining FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 approval of budget revisions that 
reflect significant change to approved operating cost levels that occur 
during the budget year. Minor revisions to an approved FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 budget to reflect changes of 5 
percent or less in any subtotal area of the budget need not be subject 
to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval unless 
specifically required as an approval condition. Other minor revisions of 
a few line items may be entered on the current approved budget as 
``pencil'' changes and initialed by the borrower and approved by FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Major changes involving 
many budget line items will warrant a new budget being prepared and 
approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    3  When revisions to approved budgets are required, the Agency 
action should normally be obtained within 30 days. Should action be 
delayed, the borrower or management should notify the Agency of any 
changes which they deem as being essential and in the project's best 
interest provided such changes do not involve the use of reserve funds, 
a rent change, or added secured debt, and proceed to meet the needs of 
the project. In such cases, the borrower may request, and the Agency may 
grant, postapproval of the actions when shown to be in the best interest 
of the project.
    XIII  Accounting and Reporting Requirements and Financial Management 
Analysis:
    A  General. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
anticipates that RRH, RCH, and LH borrowers will account for all project 
income and expenses through a bookkeeping or accounting system as a 
normal business practice appropriately reflecting the complexity of 
project operations. The degree of sophistication will also reflect such 
factors as the type of borrower; the size, location, and type of project 
and the type of financial management information needed to provide 
adequate guidance and supervision to assure program objectives are being 
met.
    1  Separate accountability. Separate accountability of funds is 
required and may be accomplished by bookkeeping entry for each required 
account for each project owned by the same borrower. The policies set 
out herein are aimed at facilitating efficient accounting of services by 
one borrower. Commingling of the funds of two or more different 
borrowers is prohibited to guard against the failure of one borrower 
threatening the financial resources of other borrowers (i.e., ensuring 
that a bankruptcy does not result in freezing bank accounts of several 
borrowers due to the failure of one borrower to fulfill its 
responsibilities).
    a  Multiple projects owned by one borrower.
    (1) The principle of separate accountability permits a borrower's 
approved accounting system to combine project funds in one or more bank 
accounts for two or more projects owned by the same borrower. The 
principle is met as long as the accounting system segregates and tracks 
each project's funds separately. This means for example, that a Housing 
Authority, or any other borrower owning two or more projects, can 
maintain one bank account for:
    (i) All project accounts, or
    (ii) The same type of account, such as general operating account or 
tax and insurance account, for two or more projects.
    (2) When the borrower seeks approval of its accounting and funds 
tracking system according to Sec. 1930.122(a)(2) of this subpart, it 
must demonstrate to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 that the funds tracking system will segregate and maintain separate 
recordkeeping accountability for separate projects. Such demonstration 
must include a certification issued by a Certified Public Accountant 
(CPA) stating the system will function to meet this principle of 
separate accountability.
    b  Multiple projects owned by multiple borrowers. When a management 
agent is handling funds for multiple borrowers, the principles of 
separate accountability within a bank account does not extend across 
multiple borrowers, thus a separate general operating bank account is 
required for each separate borrower.
    c  Central funds collection and disbursement system. When a 
management agent is handling multiple bank accounts for multiple 
borrowers, a central funds collection and disbursement accounting system 
may be maintained. This would permit systems under which a management 
agent could track funds going into and out of the bank accounts of more 
than one borrower. This practice would facilitate the hiring and paying 
of firms providing services to multiple borrowers. A central funds 
collection and disbursement accounting system would permit billings to 
be prorated between projects and permit funds to be withdrawn from many 
bank accounts to facilitate payment by one check to a firm providing 
services to multiple borrowers.
    d  Prorating. The accounting system and/or management plan must 
document how funds are prorated for revenue and expenses which are not 
clearly identifiable as being associated with a particular project 
(e.g., how interest earned on a general operating account

[[Page 263]]

or reserve account serving two or more projects owned by a single 
borrower will be prorated between projects, etc.) Where this 
documentation is not present for some unusual reason, and the Agency and 
the borrower become involved in a dispute over this issue which cannot 
be mutually resolved, the Agency will consider proration by the number 
of units in the respective projects to be an appropriate guide for 
prorating the funds involved.
    e  Tenant security deposit concerns. When tenant security deposits 
are being accounted for, the provisions of state and local laws must be 
met. This may dictate that such accounts be held in a separate bank 
account or otherwise separately identified and may require such funds be 
held in trust for the tenant. The manner in which tenant security 
deposits must be kept must also be documented in the accounting system 
and/or management plan. Where this documentation is not provided for 
some unusual reason, resolution of any disputes must be done according 
to State and local law.
    2  Borrowers with loan agreements or resolutions. Borrowers with 
loan agreements or resolutions are subject to the following conditions:
    a  All RRH, RCH, and LH projects with loan agreements or resolutions 
approved on or after October 27, 1980, are required to comply with the 
provisions of paragraph XIII of this exhibit.
    b  All RRH, RCH, and LH projects with loan agreements or resolutions 
approved prior to October 27, 1980, will be guided by the recordkeeping 
and reporting requirements of their respective loan agreement or 
resolution.
    (1) They are encouraged, however, to adopt the provisions of this 
paragraph by amending their existing loan agreement or resolution.
    (2) The State Director may require adoption of these provisions when 
deemed necessary as a loan servicing action.
    c  Any amendment to an existing loan agreement, or resolution, 
requires concurrence of all parties and written consent of the Servicing 
Office staff who may, when deemed necessary, obtain advice from the 
State Director or the OGC prior to enactment of the amendment.
    3  Individual LH Borrowers. Individual farm borrowers with nonrental 
LH units will be considered in general compliance with this paragraph by 
virtue of completing the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of 
their farm and home planning with FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 as outlined in subpart D of part 1944 of this 
chapter.
    4  Borrowers without loan agreements or resolutions. Borrowers 
without loan agreements or resolutions are required to maintain 
information in sufficient detail to provide the necessary assurance that 
program objectives are being met. As necessary to protect the integrity 
of the program, the State Director may require the borrower to establish 
a system capable of accounting for project operations and reporting.
    B  Accounting System. A bookkeeping and accounting system provides 
the financial information needed to effectively plan, control, and 
evaluate project activity, whether required by FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 or not. The type of system should be 
determined prior to loan closing, but may be revised with FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approval to meet program 
objectives. The Agency may also prescribe the system to be used. Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-5, 
``Bookkeeping System--Small Borrower,'' can be adapted to the 
bookkeeping needs of small MFH borrowers. Bookkeeping for MFH operations 
may be maintained using a cash or accrual method of accounting.
    1  Type of borrower accounts. As used in this paragraph, the term 
account is used interchangeably to mean either a ledger (or bookkeeping 
account) or an actual banking account, or an actual securities account 
provided any securities account meets the conditions set out herein. 
Depending upon the complexity of the accounting system being used, these 
accounts may be further subdivided into subsidiary ledgers or accounts 
to assist the borrower in providing the information needed for project 
financial analysis or reporting requirements. Regardless of the number 
or types of accounts established, or whether a bookkeeping and 
accounting system is required, the borrower must meet the following:
    a  All project funds shall be held only in domestic bank accounts 
insured by an agency of the Federal Government, or backed by collateral 
provided by the bank, or held in securities meeting the conditions set 
out herein.
    b  All funds in any account shall be used only for authorized 
purposes as described in their loan agreement or resolution and this 
exhibit.
    c  All funds received and held in any account, except the tenant 
security deposit, membership fee, and management reserve (patronage 
capital), shall be held in trust by the borrower for the loan obligation 
until used and serve as security for the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 loan or grant.
    d  All project funds will be accounted for by adequate and clear 
accounting methods or practices that otherwise maintain proprietary 
identity of said funds for each borrower.
    e  Each borrower will maintain at least one demand deposit or 
checking account.

[[Page 264]]

However, it is not necessary for each bookkeeping account within one 
project to be maintained as a checking account.
    f  In no case shall project fund accounts be pledged as collateral 
for non-FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 debts.
    2  Accounts. All RRH, RCH, and LH borrowers will maintain, as a 
minimum, the accounts required by their loan agreement or resolution. 
The following accounts are standard for all RRH and RCH loans approved 
after October 27, 1980, and for those who have amended their previous 
loan agreements or resolutions to adopt these accounts, or those 
required by a servicing plan. The following listing of accounts also 
identifies the order of funding of each of the listed accounts through 
available project revenues each month:
    a  General operating account. This account records all project 
income and disbursements exclusive of tenant security deposits. Excess 
project cash held in this account may be combined with other project 
funds described in this paragraph in temporary (immediate call) interest 
bearing accounts when separate bookkeeping records are maintained for 
the individual project accounts. This account may be further subdivided 
as folllows:
    (1) Initial operating capital.
    (i) The initial operating capital must be in the form of cash as set 
forth in Sec. 1944.211(a)(6) of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter.
    (ii) The borrower will have deposited the required initial operating 
cash into the general operating account by the time of the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 loan closing or when interim 
financing funds are obtained, whichever occurs first. These funds will 
blend with other revenue that accrues to the account to cover budgeted 
expenditures including payment of return to owner.
    (iii) After 2, but before 5 full (12 month) borrower fiscal years of 
project operation, the borrower may request (in writing) the State 
Director's authorization to make a one-time withdrawal of the initial 
operating capital, or a part of it. The one-time withdrawal can never 
exceed the initial operating capital as described in the loan agreement 
or loan resolution. The withdrawal can be approved provided that:
    (A) The project has achieved at least a 95 percent occupancy level 
at time of the withdrawal request or achieved a 95 percent occupancy 
level for a 12-month period preceding the request and show strong 
prospects of retaining at least a 95 percent occupancy level in the 
immediate future.
    (B) The withdrawal will not affect the financial integrity of the 
project. After withdrawal, 10 percent of projected project expenses 
should remain in the general operating account in excess of current 
liabilities then outstanding. The reserve account must be on schedule 
less authorized withdrawals. The borrower must demonstrate that all 
prudent maintenance is being planned and performed, and payment of 
necessary project expenses are not being deferred.
    (C) The State Director determines that the withdrawal will not 
necessitate a rent increase during the year of withdrawal or during the 
next year of operation, except that rent increases needed because of 
normal increases of operation and maintenance expenses unrelated to the 
withdrawal may be approved; and
    (D) The State Director has reviewed and approved any required 
borrower reports before the initial operating capital is withdrawn. 
Promptness is expected but actual withdrawal of funds could occur in the 
sixth year.
    (2) Deposits. All income and revenue from the housing project shall, 
upon receipt, be immediately deposited in the general operating account. 
This will include rent or occupancy charge receipts, housing subsidy 
payments (including HUD section 8 and FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 RA payments), laundry revenue, or any other project 
income including interest earned on project accounts. The borrower may 
also deposit other funds at any time which are to be used for purposes 
authorized by this section, including transfers from the reserve 
account.
    (3) Disbursements. The borrower shall pay or fund the actual, 
reasonable, and necessary monthly project expenses out of the general 
operating account. Current expenses may include the initial purchase and 
installation of furnishings and equipment with any other funds deposited 
in the general operating account which are not proceeds of the loan or 
income or revenue from the project. (However, nonprofit borrowers are 
permitted to use loan funds specified for initial operating capital 
purposes as authorized in subparts D and E of part 1944 of this 
chapter.) Other authorized disbursements are FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 approved installments of debt service; 
real estate tax and insurance escrow as provided in paragraph XIII B 2 b 
of this exhibit; reserve, and return on investment as provided in 
paragraph XIII B 2 c of this exhibit. In RRH accounts, any balance 
remaining in a general operating account, except as authorized, above, 
may be retained in this account or transferred to the reserve account. 
In RCH accounts, any balance in excess of three months of average 
operating expenses remaining in a general operating account will be 
transferred into the cooperative's patronage capital account at the end 
of the fiscal year.
    (4) Unauthorized disbursements. Except for cooperatives, late fees 
charged the borrower according to subpart K of part 1951 of this

[[Page 265]]

chapter, may not be paid from project income. When late fees are 
deducted by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 from 
payments made from project income, the project general operating account 
must be reimbursed from nonproject income of the owner or management 
agent or deducted from the owner's return on investment.
    b  Real estate tax and insurance escrow account. According to the 
borrower's management plan, project funds for periodic payment(s) of 
real estate taxes and real property insurance may be deposited in a real 
estate tax and insurance escrow account or held in the general operating 
account as cash on hand. The escrow account may be an interest bearing 
account. Deposits to the account should be in monthly increments of one-
twelfth of the annual anticipated real estate tax and insurance 
payments. Any interest earned shall accrue to the project as project 
operational cash income.
    c. Reserve account. The reserve account is a required account 
subject to the requirements set out in this paragraph. The borrower will 
initiate monthly deposits in this project account, preferably an 
interest bearing account, starting the same month the first loan payment 
is due FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. As 
projects age, the required reserve account level may be adjusted to meet 
anticipated ``life-cycle'' needs, including equipment and facility 
replacement costs, by amending the loan agreement/resolution. All RRH, 
RCH, and LH borrowers operating projects (i.e., all LH borrowers 
exclusive of those on-farm type LH borrowers) are required to establish 
a reserve account. Effective as of July 26, 1994, reserve funds will be 
required to be placed in a supervised account. The provisions of subpart 
A of part 1902 of this chapter apply. Reserve funds on deposit just 
prior to this date in instruments which are subject to monetary 
penalties for early withdrawal may be temporarily held for the time 
needed to avoid such penalties.
    (1) Monthly installments. Immediately after paying each installment 
for the orderly retirement of the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 loan, as provided in the borrower's promissory note, 
required reserve installments shall be transferred to the Reserve 
Account at least at the monthly rate stipulated by the borrower's loan 
agreement or resolution starting with the date the first payment is due 
to the Agency. Monthly transfers will continue until the account reaches 
the total amount specified in the loan agreement or resolution. Monthly 
transfers shall be resumed the month following withdrawals that decrease 
the reserve account balance below its required level until it is 
restored to the specified total minimum sum.
    (2) Reserve account principles. Reserve account funds are governed 
by the following principles:
    (i) Primary use. The reserve account is primarily used to meet the 
major capital expense needs of a project. It is expected that the 
reserve account should rarely have to be used to meet any noncapital 
expense need of a project; however, the Servicing Official may approve 
such uses when warranted in unusual circumstances (e.g., a cash income 
shortfall, using the notice of approval at exhibit B-9 of this subpart).
    (ii) Investment vehicles and institutions. Reserve account funds not 
immediately needed to pay for expenses for authorized purposes may be 
held as set out herein. Reserve account funds may be held in the form of 
a checking, savings, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar account 
at a Federally insured domestic institution such as a bank, savings and 
loan, or credit union. Reserve account funds may be held in the form of 
readily marketable obligations of the United States Treasury Department 
(e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Savings bonds, zero coupon bonds, etc.) 
at a Federally insured domestic institution or at an insured domestic 
institution authorized to sell securities. Reserve account funds may 
also be held in the form of an account (the account may be a tax exempt 
account or a taxable account) established at an insured domestic 
institution authorized to sell securities (the institution may or may 
not charge brokerage fees), provided the accounts so established meet 
the remaining conditions set out herein and are not used in a 
speculative manner.
    (iii) Limitations on investments in securities. Any securities must 
be backed by the United States (U.S.) Government or an Agency of the 
U.S. Government, or be triple A (AAA) rated Government National Mortgage 
Association collateralized tax-emempt bonds or be AAA rated prerefunded 
bonds. Prerefunded bonds are bonds that originally may have been issued 
as general obligation or revenue bonds but are now secured, until the 
call date or maturity, by an ``escrow fund'' consisting entirely of 
direct U.S. Government obligations that are sufficient for paying the 
bondholders.
    (iv) Reporting actual costs of securities. In order to assure that 
required amounts have been paid into the reserve account, the actual 
costs of securities (which in many cases may not be the face value) must 
be shown on the project books. In addition, details of these 
transactions should be disclosed in footnotes to financial information 
provided to the Agency.
    (v) Security sales. When the Agency approves withdrawals from the 
reserve account and the funds are invested in securities, borrowers 
must, to the extent that securities are available, assure that 
securities are sold

[[Page 266]]

in an amount which results in proceeds sufficient to cover the 
disbursement.
    (vi) Forecasting security sales. Since the sale or redemption of any 
securities may result in cash proceeds of less than the amount invested, 
borrowers should take steps to minimize the risk of loss from converting 
securities to cash. Needed reserve account withdrawals should be 
forecasted well in advance to permit Agency approval of anticipated 
needs such that security sales can be arranged to be sold in favorable 
market conditions. When sales of securities take place the proceeds will 
normally be held in a reserve fund at a domestic bank, savings and loan, 
credit union, or similar institution insured by an Agency of the Federal 
Government until such time as withdrawals are actually needed for the 
purposes authorized. Should unusual circumstances require the sale of 
securities in unfavorable market conditions the borrower will not be 
required to reimburse the project for any losses incurred.
    (vii) Knowledge required of securities investors. Those investing in 
securities must be knowledgeable of common industry practices prior to 
investing in securities. Knowledge of the various fees that may be 
associated with the purchase and sale of securities and the maintenance 
of security accounts must be considered when making security investments 
(e.g., front end loads or fees, back end loads or fees, maintenance 
fees, etc.). Such fees may be paid by the general operating account or 
by the reserve account. However, the Agency must give its prior consent 
before reserve account funds may be used.
    (viii) Financial advisor limitations. Project proceeds may not be 
permitted to be used to pay for the services of a financial advisor to 
assist in the selecting of securities for investments, since the 
securities permitted are relatively limited and must meet the 
requirements set out herein. However, normal brokerage fees may be paid 
to secure and sell securities. It is recognized that financial advice 
may also be provided as part of the normal brokerage fee service package 
to consummate the purchase and sale of securities. Separate financial 
advisor services fees, apart from normal brokerage fees, are prohibited, 
however.
    (3) Reserve account tracking. Any deposit and withdrawal from the 
reserve account should be recorded on a withdrawal format for tracking 
and reconciliation of the account similar to that found in exhibit B-10 
of this exhibit.
    (4) Excess reserve. Any amount in the reserve account which exceeds 
the total sum specified in the loan agreement or resolution may be 
transferred to the general operating account for the authorized purposes 
only when it is agreed between the borrower and FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 to be in excess of the requirement and 
there is a specific need for the excess funds. However, the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official may direct 
the excess sum to be retained in the reserve account or applied as an 
extra payment on the loan.
    (5) Reserve account use. Funds in the reserve account may be used 
for purposes in accordance with this paragraph. The borrower will 
request withdrawal of reserve funds in a written or confirmed manner 
before they are needed. Annual budgets are to include realistic routine 
income and expense levels to avoid the need to use the reserve for 
routine expenses (operating shortfalls), not caused by emergencies or 
very unusual servicing situations; but when needed, use of reserve funds 
may be permitted with Agency approval. The Servicing Official will take 
prompt action on a request for reserve withdrawal (normally within 5 
working days of the request) and provide written authorization to the 
borrower for any authorized withdrawal of funds by the use of a letter 
in the form of exhibit B-9 of this subpart (or other similar letter 
containing at least the information shown on exhibit B-9 of this 
subpart) before the borrower actually withdraws any funds. Any 
conditions for approval (e.g., a copy of paid invoices, inspections, 
etc.) will be indicated in the letter. Although the prior consent of the 
Government is required for the use of reserve funds, the Servicing 
Official may post approve the use of reserve funds if they were used for 
authorized purposes and their expenditure would have been approved had a 
request for approval been submitted prior to the withdrawal. The 
borrower must provide documented evidence showing the actual amount and 
use of funds before the post-approval action. Authorized purposes are:
    (i) To meet payments due on the loan obligations in the event the 
amount for debt service is not sufficient for that purpose.
    (ii) To pay cost of repairs or replacements to the housing, 
furnishings or equipment or shortfalls of current expenses. Withdrawal 
for planned authorized purposes should be approved in advance during the 
annual budget approval process.
    (iii) To make improvements to the housing project without creating 
new living units or to retrofit units to make them accessible to the 
physically handicapped.
    (iv) For other purposes desired by the borrower, which in the 
judgement of the Government will promote the loan purposes, strengthen 
the security, or facilitate, improve, or maintain the project and the 
orderly collection of the loan without jeopardizing the loan or 
impairing the adequacy of the security. Reserve funds may also be used 
to facilitate payment of fees associated with the buying or selling of 
securities or maintaining a securities account.
    (v) To pay a return on investment at the end of the borrower's 
project operating year,

[[Page 267]]

provided that after such disbursements the amount in the reserve account 
will not be less than that required by the loan agreement or resolution 
to be accumulated by that time (taking into consideration the provisions 
of any approved servicing plan which may be authorizing a temporary 
adjustment to these provisions), minus any authorized withdrawals, and 
provided that the amount in the reserve account will likely not fall 
below that required to be accumulated during the next 12 months.
    (A) In the case of borrowers operating on a limited profit basis, to 
pay a return on the borrower's initial investment as identified in the 
loan agreement or resolution.
    (B) In the case of borrowers operating on a full profit basis, to 
pay an annual return as specified in the borrower's loan agreement or 
resolution.
    (6) Exhibit B-10 of this subpart may be used by the borrower and 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to record deposits 
and withdrawals in the reserve account and to perform reconciliation of 
the account to determine the current account balance.
    d  Management reserve account (patronage capital account). Any funds 
in excess of three months of average operating expenses remaining in the 
general operating account of an RCH project at the end of the fiscal 
year will be transferred and maintained in a lump sum in an interest 
bearing patronage capital account and will be handled according to any 
state laws governing patronage capital. That amount will then be equally 
assigned, by bookkeeping entry only, to each member. The patronage 
capital funds will be held by the cooperative in trust for the 
respective member until that member terminates membership in the 
cooperative, provided the member has paid all charges and costs due the 
cooperative. The patronage capital funds will not be used for any other 
purpose.
    e  Security deposit or membership fee account (when applicable). 
Upon receipt, all security deposit or membership fee funds collected 
shall be recorded in a bookkeeping account that is kept separate from 
the project bookkeeping accounts. These funds shall be deposited in a 
separate bank account that is kept separate from any project funds and 
will be handled according to any state or local laws governing security 
deposits. Funds in the security or membership fee deposit account shall 
be used only for authorized purposes as intended and represented by the 
project management plan. They shall be held by the borrower or 
borrower's management agent in trust for the respective tenants or 
members until so used. Any amount of the security deposit account which 
is retained by the borrower as a result of lease or occupancy agreement 
violations shall be transferred to the general operating account and 
treated as income of the housing.
    (1) The owner will follow all State and local requirements governing 
the handling and disposition of security or membership fee deposits.
    (2) In no case will interest earned on security or membership fee 
deposits accrue to project management or the owner of a rental project. 
Any interest earned but not returned to the tenants, or in the case of a 
cooperative, interest earned on membership fees but not returned to 
members will, accrue to the project's general operating account for 
disposition as outlined in the management plan.
    C  Borrower reporting requirements. It is the objective of FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that borrowers will 
maintain accounts and records necessary to conduct their operation 
successfully and from which they may accurately report operational 
results to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for 
review, and otherwise comply with the terms of their loan agreements 
with the Agency. Certain reports are necessary to verify compliance with 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 requirements and 
to aid the borrower in carrying out the objectives of the loan. Some 
reports must be submitted with the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 payments and others submitted to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 either monthly, quarterly, or 
annually. Exhibits B-6, B-7, and B-8 of this subpart are to be used as a 
guide for determining when reports are due and the number of copies 
required. Borrower accounts and records will be kept or made available 
in a location within reasonable access for inspection, review and 
copying by representatives of FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 or other agencies of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
authorized by the Department.
    1  Accounting methods and records.
    a  Method of accounting and financial statements. Borrowers may 
choose a cash or accrual method of accounting, bookkeeping and budget 
preparation as described in their project management plan. Balance 
sheets or statements of financial condition may be prepared reflecting 
the same accounting method, except that the accrual method of reporting 
financial condition will be used where the borrower is required to 
submit an annual audit.
    b  Approval requirement. Before loan closing or start of 
construction, whichever is first, each borrower shall incorporate a 
description of its method of accounting, bookkeeping, budget 
preparation, and reporting of financial condition and, when applicable, 
plans for auditing in the project management plan that must be approved 
by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.

[[Page 268]]

    c  Records. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1930-5 may be used by small organizations as a method of recording 
and maintaining accounting transactions. Automated systems may be used 
if they meet the conditions of paragraph XVI of this exhibit.
    d  Record retention. Each borrower shall retain all financial 
records, books, and supporting material for at least 3 years after the 
issuance of the audit reports and financial statements. Upon request, 
this material will be made available to FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), the 
Comptroller General, or to their representatives.
    2  Management reports and review processes. The objective of 
management reports and review processes is to furnish the management and 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with a means of 
evaluating prior decisions and to serve as a basis for planning future 
operations and financial conditions. Timely reports and their review 
furnish necessary information to make sound management decisions. All 
reports will relate only to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 financed project and borrower entity. Separate 
reports will be prepared and submitted for each project owned by the 
same borrower. Forms necessary in making the required reports may be 
requested from FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. 
The various review processes described in this paragraph are illustrated 
at paragraph XIII C 3 of this exhibit.
    a  Annual budget and utility allowance.
    (1) Objective. It is the objective of FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 that project budgets and/or utility allowances 
be prepared, reviewed, and approved in such manner and timing that the 
approved budget and/or utility allowance, including any authorized 
changes to same, become effective on the beginning of a fiscal year of 
project operation.
    (2) Documents.
    (i) The annual project budget will be prepared on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 by the borrower or its 
agent following the instructions on the form. It will reflect budget 
planning for a 12 month fiscal year. Figures in the ``actual'' column 
will reflect at least 9 months of actual fiscal year activity and no 
more than 3 months of estimated activity for the balance of the same 
fiscal year based on recent actual experience.
    (ii) The housing allowance for utilities and other public services 
will be prepared on exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 1944 of this 
chapter. The exhibit A-6 will be prepared by the borrower or its agent 
following instructions attached to exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 1944 
of this chapter.
    (3) Supporting data. Any data, justification or other documentation 
required by the instructions for preparation of Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 and exhibit A-6 of 
subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter, or otherwise required by the 
Servicing Official on an individual case basis, shall be attached to the 
respective document when submitted to the Servicing Office.
    (4) Due date. The borrower can submit the necessary documents as 
soon as 9 months of current fiscal year actuals are available, but in 
sufficient time to meet the objective stated at C 2 a (1) of this 
paragraph. The Servicing Official needs 15 to 30 days to review project 
budgets and utility allowances when no changes of rents, occupancy 
charges, or utility allowances are needed. When such changes are needed, 
the borrower needs to submit documents to allow sufficient time for 
review and proper notice of change to tenants or members.
    (5) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review. 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 and 
exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and any attachment 
will be reviewed by the Servicing Office as part of the rental or 
occupancy charge/utility allowance change review and/or annual review 
process.
    b  Rental or occupancy charge budget and/or utility allowance 
change.
    (1) Objective. It is the objective of FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 that changes to project rental or occupancy 
charges and/or utility allowances be incorporated into the annual budget 
review and planning process in such manner and timing that authorized 
changes become effective at the beginning of a fiscal year of project 
operation.
    (2) Documents. When a rental or occupancy charge and/or utility 
allowance change is proposed, the borrower or its agent will prepare and 
submit Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 
and exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and any 
supporting attachments following the instructions for either document.
    (3) Standards and timing.
    (i) The policies and procedures governing rental or occupancy charge 
and/or utility allowance change are contained in exhibit C of this 
subpart, (available in the ``Borrower Handbook'' or any FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (ii) To meet the projected effective date of change, the necessary 
documents need to be received by the Servicing Official at least 75 days 
ahead to allow FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
review and allow for a 60-day notice to tenants or members of an 
impending change. The ``actual''

[[Page 269]]

column of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1930-7 shall contain actual data for the fiscal year to date plus the 
projection of expected data for the remainder of the fiscal year. This 
projection should cover a period not exceeding 90 days. The same 
supporting data standards of paragraph XIII C 2 a (3) of this exhibit 
will apply.
    (iii) Should the borrower need to request a rental or occupancy 
charge and/or utility allowance change at some time other than described 
at paragraph XIII C 2 b(3)(ii) of this exhibit (e.g., mid-fiscal year), 
the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 
shall reflect the project's financial needs for the next 12 months of 
operation and the ``actual'' column shall reflect the most recent 12 
months of actual data. The previous fiscal year's audit report, or Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-8, as 
appropriate, shall be submitted with the change request if it was not 
previously submitted to the Servicing Office.
    (4) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review. 
Exhibit C of this subpart shall govern FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 review of the borrower's request for rental or 
occupancy charge and/or utility allowance change.
    c  Quarterly report.
    (1) Objective. The objective of FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 is for quarterly reports to provide a monitoring 
means for borrowers and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 to mutually check a borrower's progress in achieving program 
objectives and when applicable, meeting servicing goals. The Servicing 
Official may require monthly reports rather than quarterly reports when 
warranted in unusual situations.
    (2) Document. Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-7 will be used by borrowers to prepare the quarterly 
report.
    (3) Standards.
    (i) For quarterly reports, Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-7 will be completed following the instructions 
on the form for preparation of a quarterly report. The quarterly report 
shall be required upon commencement of any of the following situations:
    (A) Start-up of initial occupancy after completion of new 
construction or substantial rehabilitation.
    (B) Reamortization, transfer of an existing project loan or a 100-
percent membership change.
    (C) Failure to make a scheduled loan payment, failure to maintain 
required transfers to the reserve account, or failure to maintain 
reserve accounts at authorized current levels.
    (ii) For monthly reports, Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-7 will be completed following the instructions 
on the form for preparing a monthly report. The monthly report may be 
invoked:
    (A) When determined essential by the Servicing Official as part of a 
servicing plan made in accordance with exhibit F of subpart B of part 
1965 of this chapter (available in any FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (B) When there are factors such as apparent violations of policy or 
reporting practices, audit findings, sudden increases of vacancy and/or 
accounts payable or receivables, or other evidence of weak financial 
condition.
    (4) Frequency and discontinuance of quarterly and monthly reports.
    (i) Reports shall be prepared and submitted at least through the 
first year of operation for any situation described in paragraph XIII C 
2 c (3) of this exhibit and each quarter or month thereafter for new or 
existing projects until discontinuance is authorized by the Servicing 
Official. The Servicing Official will evaluate the following in reaching 
a decision to discontinue:
    (A) The project has been operated and maintained in a satisfactory 
manner during the most recent 6 months of the required reporting period.
    (B) An adequate accounting system is functioning properly, is kept 
current, and the most recent required annual financial reports are 
complete and have been submitted to the Servicing Office.
    (C) Project loan payments to FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 are on schedule.
    (D) The project reserve account is ahead or on schedule, allowing 
for authorized expenditures or authorized reduction in funding as set 
forth in an approved servicing plan or budget.
    (E) The annual review has been completed by the Servicing Office and 
the annual audit, or verification of review when appropriate, has been 
found acceptable.
    (F) The Servicing Official has inspected the project, reviewed 
project operations, and found them acceptable. If a determination is 
made to discontinue, a letter shall be sent to the borrower or its agent 
with a copy sent to the State Director.
    (ii) The reporting and audit requirements of paragraphs XIII C 2 
c(4)(i) (B) and (E) do not apply when the most recent 6 continuous 
months of successful operation occur before the first audit and/or 
annual review is due.
    (5) Due date. Quarterly (or monthly) reports shall be due in the 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Office 
by the 20th day of the month immediately following the close of the 
respective reporting period.
    (6) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review.

[[Page 270]]

    (i) The Servicing Official will review the reports for year-to-date 
status of project operations. When reports reveal actual data that 
exceeds acceptable tolerance from a forecasted budget Subtotal item, or 
vacancies and accounts receivable and/or payable are increasing, the 
Servicing Official will initiate verbal and/or written dialogue with the 
borrower for further resolution of problems or to otherwise achieve 
acceptable progress.
    (ii) The Servicing Official will complete the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 review and forward the borrower's report 
and any related documentation to the State Director by the 30th day of 
the month following close of the reporting period.
    (iii) If the borrower fails to submit its report by the due date, 
this fact will be reported to the State Director by the 30th day of the 
month following the close of the reporting period; otherwise, the 
Servicing Office will complete its review of a submitted report no later 
than 10 calendar days following receipt of the borrower's report.
    d  Annual audit reports and verifications of review.
    (1) Documents and general standards.
    (i) Annual audit report. An audit report will be in the format as 
prepared by a CPA or Licensed Public Accountant (LPA), provided the LPA 
was licensed on or before December 31, 1970.
    (A) All audits are to be performed in accordance with generally 
accepted government auditing standards or GAGAS, as set forth in 
``Government Auditing Standards'' (1988 Revision), established by the 
Comptroller General of the United States, and any subsequent revisions 
(this publication is commonly referred to as the ``Yellow Book'' or 
``Government Accounting Office Standards''). In addition, the audits are 
also to be performed in accordance with applicable portions of various 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars, Departmental 
Regulations, parts 3015 and 3016 of chapter XXX of title 7, and the FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Audit Program as 
specified in separate sections of this subpart.
    (B) An audit report is required for any project with 25 or more 
units unless the State Director or Servicing Official determines that a 
project with 24 or fewer units requires an audit for reasons of good 
cause. Such reasons include, but are not limited to, situations where 
project records are incomplete or inaccurate, or it appears that the 
borrower has not adequately accounted for project funds, or where the 
borrower's operation consists of multiple projects where each is 24 or 
fewer units (with subsidy reports prepared for each project). (Note: The 
State Director or Servicing Official may require that the accounts of 
RHS borrowers be audited if the loan exceeds the 2-year repayment term.)
    (C) The project audit report should cover the borrower entity and 
the expense for preparation of the audit report may include the 
auditor's preparation of any IRS required borrower entity reports (i.e., 
Schedule K-1 (IRS Form 1065), ``Partner's Share of Income, Credits, 
Deductions, etc.'').
    (D) The CPA or LPA auditor who prepares the audit report may not be 
an individual or organization that is associated with the borrower in 
any manner, other than the performance of the audit review and 
preparation of the project audit report and required IRS reports, that 
creates an identity of interest or possible conflict of interest (as 
described in paragraph V B of this exhibit. For example, the CPA or LPA 
auditor may not be an employee of the borrower or an employee of any 
officer of the organization, nor be an employee of any member, 
stockholder, partner, principal, or have any ownership or other interest 
in the borrower organization.
    (E) The State Director or Servicing Official may authorize the 
initial audit report to cover a period up to 18 months for new projects 
whose first operating year does not exceed 6 months.
    (F) The State Director may also make an exception to the CPA or LPA 
audit requirement for not more than one successive year in a specific 
case providing: the borrower submits a written request; the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approved budget for the 
project includes a typical and reasonable fee for the audit but the 
negotiated cost of an audit would increase the monthly per unit rental 
rate by more than $4.00; and the required reports, including a CPA or 
LPA prepared audit, were properly submitted for the prior year's project 
operations.
    (ii) Verification of review. Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1930-8 will be prepared by a competent person 
qualified by education and/or experience who has no identity of interest 
or possible conflict of interest with the borrower or its principals. 
However, in the case of a nonprofit institution, the verification of 
review may be made by a committee of the membership but may not include 
any officer, director, or employee of the borrower.
    (A) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-
8 will be used for the verification of review of project accounts and 
the review verifier will also review the actual data on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 for projects with 24 or 
fewer units unless the requirements of paragraph XIII C 2 d(1)(i)(A) of 
this exhibit are invoked by the State Director or Servicing Official.
    (B) The State Director or Servicing Official may authorize the 
initial verification of review to cover a period up to 18 months for

[[Page 271]]

a new project whose first operating year was less than 6 months.
    (iii) Project operating budget actuals. An annual report of actuals 
for the full operating year will be submitted by the borrower, or its 
agent, using Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1930-7. The report will reflect the actual income and expenses for the 
project for the borrower's 12-month operating year. The report will be 
submitted with the annual audit report or Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-8, as appropriate.
    (iv) Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1930-10, ``Annual Multiple Family Housing Project Review.'' When the 
annual audit report or verification of review is received, parts II C 
and D of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1930-10 may be prefilled to the extent possible to record previous year 
status as reported in the audit report or verification of review. The 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-10 will 
be completed later as described in Sec. 1930.123 (e)(2) and (i) of this 
subpart.
    (v) Fraud, abuse, and illegal acts. If the review verifier becomes 
aware of any indication of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts in FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financed projects, prompt 
written notice shall be given to the appropriate Servicing Official.
    (2) Specific standards.
    (i) State and local governments and Indian tribes. These 
organizations are to be audited in accordance with this subpart, 7 CFR 
part 3015, and OMB Circular A-128, with copies of the audit being 
forwarded by the borrower to the Servicing Official and the appropriate 
Federal cognizant agency, if applicable. For guidance in meeting these 
requirements, the auditor may refer to the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide for ``Audits of 
State and Local Governmental Units.'' The term Federal financial 
assistance used herein shall mean Federal loan and/or grant funds 
received by the borrower, but not rental subsidies.
    (A) Cognizant agency. (1) ``Cognizant agency'' means the Federal 
agency assigned by OMB Circular A-128. Within the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), the USDA OIG shall fulfill cognizant agency 
responsibilities.
    (2) Cognizant agency assignments. Smaller borrowers not assigned a 
cognizant agency by OMB should contact the Federal agency that provided 
the most funds. When USDA is designated as the cognizant agency or when 
it has been determined by the borrower that FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 provided the major portion of Federal financial 
assistance, the appropriate USDA OIG Regional Inspector General shall be 
contacted.
    (B) Audit standards. It is not intended that audits required by this 
subpart be separate and apart from audits performed in accordance with 
State and local laws. To the extent feasible, the audit work should be 
done in conjunction with those audits.
    (1) State and local governments and Indian tribes that receive 
$100,000 or more a year in Federal financial assistance shall have an 
audit made in accordance with OMB Circular A-128.
    (2) State and local governments and Indian tribes that receive 
between $25,000 and $100,000 a year in Federal financial assistance 
shall have an audit made in accordance with OMB Circular A-128 or in 
accordance with the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 Audit Program. This is an option of the State and local government 
or Indian tribe. If the election is made to have an audit performed in 
accordance with the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 Audit Program, the audit shall be in accordance with paragraph XIII 
C 2 d(2)(iii) of this exhibit.
    (3) State and local governments and Indian tribes that receive less 
than $25,000 a year in Federal financial assistance shall be exempt from 
compliance with OMB Circular A-128 and the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 Audit Program. These State and local 
governments and Indian tribes shall be governed by audit standards 
prescribed by State and local law or regulation.
    (4) Public hospitals and public colleges and universities may be 
excluded from OMB Circular A-128 audit standards. If such entities are 
excluded, audits shall be made in accordance with paragraph XIII C 2 
d(2)(ii) of this exhibit.
    (5) Indications of fraud, abuse, and illegal acts shall be referred 
to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for processing 
in accordance with paragraph XIII C 2 d(1)(v) of this exhibit.
    (ii) Nonprofit institutions. These organizations are to be audited 
in accordance with this subpart, 7 CFR part 3015, and OMB Circular A-
133, with copies of the audit being forwarded by the borrower to the 
Servicing Office and the appropriate Federal cognizant agency, if 
applicable. The term Federal financial assistance used herein shall mean 
Federal loan and/or grant funds received by the borrower, but not rental 
subsidies.
    (A) Cognizant agency. See paragraph XIII C 2 d(2)(i)(A) of this 
exhibit.
    (B) Audit standards.
    (1) Nonprofit institutions that receive $100,000 or more a year in 
Federal financial assistance shall have an audit made in accordance with 
the provisions of OMB Circular A-133. However, nonprofit institutions 
receiving $100,000 or more but receiving awards under only one program 
have the option of having an audit of their institution

[[Page 272]]

prepared in accordance with the provisions of the OMB Circular A-133 or 
having an audit made of the one program in accordance with paragraph 
XIII C 2 d(2)(iii) of this exhibit. For prior or subsequent years, when 
an institution has only loan guarantees or outstanding loans that were 
made previously, the institution will be required to conduct audits for 
those programs in accordance with paragraph XIII C 2 d(2)(iii) of this 
exhibit.
    (2) Nonprofit institutions that receive at lease $25,000 but less 
than $100,000 a year in Federal financial assistance shall have an audit 
made in accordance with OMB Circular A-133 or in accordance with the 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Audit Program. If 
the election is made to have an audit performed in accordance with the 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Audit Program, the 
audit shall be performed in accordance with paragraph XIII C 2 d(2)(iii) 
of this exhibit.
    (3) Nonprofit institutions receiving less than $25,000 a year in 
Federal financial assistance are exempt from Federal audit standards, 
but records must be available for review by appropriate officials of 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    (C) Fraud, waste, and abuse. Indications of fraud, abuse, and 
illegal acts shall be processed in accordance with paragraph XIII C 2 
d(1)(v) of this exhibit.
    (iii) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Audit 
Program. For-profit organizations and other entities referred to this 
paragraph by paragraphs XIII C 2 d(2)(i) and/or (ii) of this exhibit, 
audits will be performed under the guidance of the audit guide entitled 
``U.S. Department of Agriculture, Farmers Home Administration or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354-Audit Program'' (available in 
any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    (3) Due date. (i) Annual audit reports and verifications of review, 
as appropriate, and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-7 with 12 months of project operation actuals are due in 
the Servicing Office no later than 90 days following the close of the 
project fiscal year.
    (ii) If the audit or verification of review and Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 with 12 months of 
project operation actuals cannot be submitted by the due date, and the 
owner presents a request for extension supported by evidence that delay 
is at the request of the auditor, and the request has a reasonable 
explanation of why an extension of the due date is needed, the Servicing 
Official may authorize up to a 30-day extension of the due date.
    (iii) If an explanation is not forthcoming from the auditor, or the 
explanation received is without good reason, or the Servicing Official 
otherwise suspects fiscal difficulty, the Servicing Official may request 
the borrower to submit to the Servicing Office for review, the project 
bank statements for the general operating, reserve, and investment 
accounts covering the most recent 60-day period.
    (iv) If the borrower fails to submit the requested bank statements 
by the date stipulated by the Servicing Official, the Servicing Official 
will immediately refer the matter to the OIG.
    (4) FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 review. An 
audit report or verification of review and Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7 with 12 months of project 
operation actuals will be reviewed by the Servicing Official within 60 
days following receipt of the audit report or verification of review. 
From this annual audit review process, the Servicing Official will 
initiate action on findings and concerns needing immediate attention. 
Those findings and concerns not needing immediate action will be 
considered in the next budget planning and annual review process at the 
end of the fiscal year for implementation in the following fiscal year 
of project operation.
    e  Miscellaneous management reports. These reports include, but are 
not limited to, the following items that provide additional or unique 
information that augment or otherwise support other management reports

    D  Financial and management analysis. Financial and management 
analysis provides information on the status of the project's operation. 
Regular analysis by the borrower and/or FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 can help identify strengths, weaknesses, and 
reasonableness of income and expenses so that appropriate corrective 
actions can be taken. Some methods of analysis FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 encourages are:
    1  Budget analysis: Using quarterly (or monthly if deemed necessary) 
and annual reports, the borrower or project manager compares actual 
income and expenses with the budgeted amounts. Any differences between 
the budget and actual figures indicate areas of the project operation 
where the manager may need to focus added attention and/or take 
corrective action.
    2  Ratio analysis: Ratios are an effective tool for financial 
analysis. They prescribe

[[Page 274]]

various measures of actual operating performance. FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 and borrowers should develop a data base 
of recorded ratios for comparative analysis. Some useful ratios are:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC05SE91.000

    XIV  Termination and Eviction: Borrowers and project managers should 
actively develop ways and means to avoid forced termination of leases or 
occupancy agreements and the eviction of tenants or members by 
considering the following:
    A  Entitlement to continued occupancy.
    1  General. The borrower or project manager may terminate or refuse 
to renew any occupancy only for material noncompliance with the lease or 
occupancy agreement or other good cause such as:
    a  Noneligibility for tenancy.
    b  Action or conduct of the tenant or member which disrupts the 
livability of the project by being a direct threat to the health or 
safety of any person, or the right of any tenant or member of the quiet 
enjoyment of the premises and related project facilities, or that 
results in substantial physical damage causing an adverse financial 
effect on the project, or the property of others, Except when such 
threat can be removed by applying a reasonable accommodation.
    c  Expiration of the lease or occupancy agreement period is not 
sufficient grounds for eviction of a tenant or member.
    2  Material noncompliance. Material noncompliance with the lease or 
occupancy agreement includes:
    a  One or more substantial violations of the lease or occupancy 
agreement; or
    b  Nonpayment or repeated late payment of rent or occupancy charge 
or any other financial obligation due under the lease or occupancy 
agreement (including any portion thereof) beyond any grace period 
constitutes a substantial violation; or
    c  Admission to or conviction for use, attempted use, possession, 
manufacture, selling, or distribution of an illegal controlled substance 
that:

[[Page 275]]

    (1) is conducted in or on the premises by the tenant or someone 
under the tenant's control.
    (2) is allowed to happen by a household member or guest because the 
tenant has not taken reasonable steps to prevent or control such illegal 
activity; or because the tenant has not taken steps to remove the 
household member or guest who is conducting the illegal activity.
    (3) It is not the intent that this provision of material lease 
violation apply to innocent members of the tenant's household who are 
not engaged in the illegal activity, nor are responsible for control of 
another household member or guest. It is the intent that such innocent 
persons can remain in the dwelling unit if an otherwise eligible 
household remains or can be formed.
    3  Other good cause.
    a  Repeated minor violations of the lease or occupancy agreement 
which disrupt the livability and harmony of the project by adversely 
affecting the health or safety of any person, or the right of any tenant 
or member to the quiet enjoyment of the leased premises and the related 
project, or that have an adverse financial effect on the project.
    b  The borrower or project manager must base their decision on 
current objective data, not on supposition that the tenant may or could 
pose a harm or threat to other persons or property.
    c  Conduct cannot be considered as other good cause unless the 
borrower or project manager has given the tenant or member prior notice 
that the conduct will constitute a basis for termination of occupancy.
    4  Rent overburden.
    a  Any tenant household (except those receiving Section 8 benefits) 
paying more than the contribution levels cited in paragraphs IV A 2 c 
(1), (2), or (3) of this exhibit toward rent, including utilities, is 
considered to be experiencing rent overburden that may jeopardize a 
tenant's ability to maintain occupancy.
    b  Whenever a tenant is experiencing rent overburden, borrowers are 
encouraged to utilize any available and compatible governmental or 
private rental subsidies including FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 RA and/or interest credit; or to inform tenants where 
they may apply for Section 8 housing assistance to minimize termination 
of tenancy.
    c  With reference to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 RA or interest credit, no further action by the borrower is 
necessary if the borrower has already requested RA in conjunction with a 
previous rental or occupancy charge change request.
    d  For purpose of this provision, the term ``rent overburden'' also 
refers to occupancy charges paid by cooperative members.
    5  Tenant or member benefits during termination through eviction.
    a  Continued occupancy. Tenant or member households may continue 
occupancy through the specified termination date, or if judicial action 
is initiated to evict, to the specified date in a court order for 
eviction. In addition, this policy applies when a tenant or member has 
filed a discrimination complaint and a final decision on the complaint's 
resolution is awaited from the Department's Office of Advocacy and 
Enterprise or the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
    b  Rental subsidy. During termination, RA payments and/or interest 
credit will be administered following this outline according to type of 
situation:
    (1) Failure to recertify.
    (i) If failure to recertify is the fault of the tenant or member:
    (A) The borrower will charge the tenant or member note rate rent or 
occupancy charge during the period of occupancy with an expired 
certification and will remit collected overage to the Servicing Office.
    (B) If the tenant or member does not pay rent during this period, 
the project will not be required to pay overage.
    (ii) The borrower will send a copy of the termination notice to the 
Servicing Official, together with a copy of the ``90 day'' and ``30 
day'' letters sent to the tenant.
    (iii) The Servicing Official will suspend payment of any RA until 
the recertification process is completed; otherwise until the tenant or 
member moves out or is evicted by court order, whichever occurs first.
    (iv) The Servicing Official will annotate the next processed project 
master list with an ``E'' for expiration in column 5 of part II of Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29 for the 
appropriate tenant(s) or member(s).
    (v) If failure to recertify is the fault of the borrower or 
management, through no fault of the tenant or member:
    (A) The Servicing Official will advise the borrower or management to 
rescind the notice of termination.
    (B) Overage will be paid from project funds or by the management 
agent, depending on the provisions of the management plan and management 
agreement.
    (C) Until a new tenant certification is effective, the tenant shall 
continue to pay the rent or occupancy charge established by the expired 
tenant certification.
    (vi) If the termination process is nullified, either by completing 
the recertification process, by judicial action or the resolution of a 
discrimination complaint, the Servicing Official will restore RA and 
request RA payment retroactive to the date it was withheld, based on the 
newly verified tenant certification. If the termination process ends 
with voluntary tenant/member move-out or court

[[Page 276]]

ordered eviction, whichever occurs first, the RA will be assigned to the 
next tenant or member that is RA eligible at the time of the move-out or 
eviction.
    (2) Lease violation.
    (i) The borrower will send a copy of the termination notice to the 
Servicing Official.
    (ii) The Servicing Official will annotate the next processed project 
master list with a ``T'' for termination in column 5 of part II of Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29 for the 
appropriate tenant(s) or member(s).
    (iii) The Servicing Official will continue to authorize RA for the 
tenant or member.
    (iv) The borrower will continue to charge and collect the rental or 
occupancy charge rate established by the tenant's or member's current 
tenant certification.
    (v) If the termination process is nullified, either by resolution of 
the lease violation or by court action, normal tenant/member status 
resumes. If the termination ends with tenant/member move-out or court 
ordered eviction, whichever occurs first, the RA will be assigned to the 
next tenant or member that is RA eligible at the time of the move-out or 
eviction.
    (vi) If the tenant certification expires while a notice of 
termination for lease violation or good cause is in effect (i.e., 
litigation is pending):
    (A) The borrower will continue to assess the rent or occupancy 
charge to the tenant/member at the rates established by the expired 
tenant certification, through such time the court has rendered a 
decision, or the tenant/member has moved out, whichever occurs first. 
(Note: the tenant/member must pay the rent or occupancy charge into an 
escrow account pending the outcome of litigation.)
    (B) The project will not be required to pay overage.
    (C) Should the court deny the termination and order reinstatement of 
occupancy, the borrower shall promptly complete the recertification 
process as of the current time to become effective as soon as possible, 
collect the due rent or occupancy charge, and request RA retroactive to 
the date it was suspended.
    B  Notice of lease or occupancy agreement violation. A notice of 
lease or occupancy agreement violation is prepared and issued by the 
borrower or authorized representative. Any such notice must be based on 
material violation of the lease or occupancy agreement terms or for 
other documented good cause as determined by the borrower or the project 
manager.
    1  The notice of lease or occupancy agreement violation will be 
handled according to the terms of the lease or occupancy agreement. 
Tenants or members will be given prior notice of lease or occupancy 
agreement violation according to State or local law. The notice must:
    a  Refer to relevant provisions in the lease or occupancy agreement.
    b  State the violations with enough information describing the 
nature and frequency of the problem to enable the tenant or member to 
understand and correct the problem. In those cases where the lease or 
occupancy agreement violation is due to the tenant's failure to pay rent 
or the member's failure to pay occupancy charge, a notice stating the 
dollar amount of the balance due on the rent or occupancy charge account 
and the date of such computation shall satisfy this requirement.
    c  State that the tenant or member will be expected to correct the 
lease or occupancy agreement violation by a specified date.
    d  State that the tenant or member may informally meet with the 
borrower or borrower representative to attempt to resolve the stated 
violation before the date of corrective action specified in the notice.
    e  Advise the tenant or member that if he or she has not corrected 
the stated violation by the date specified, the borrower may seek to 
terminate the lease or occupancy agreement by bringing forth a judicial 
action, at which time the tenant or member may present a defense.
    2  The notice shall be accomplished by: sending a letter by first 
class mail to the tenant or member at his or her address at the project; 
or by serving a copy of the notice on any adult person answering the 
door at the dwelling unit, or if no adult responds, by placing the 
notice under or through the door, if possible, or by affixing the notice 
to the door. Service shall not be deemed effective until either method 
of notice as described herein has been accomplished. The date on which 
the notice shall be deemed to be received by the tenant or member shall 
be the date on which the required first class letter is mailed, or the 
date on which the notice provided for in this paragraph is properly 
given, whichever method of service is used.
    C  Notice of termination.
    1  Upon failure by the tenant or member to meet the condition(s) or 
correct the violation(s) stated in the notice of lease or occupancy 
agreement violation by the date specified, the tenant or member will be 
notified that the occupancy is terminated and that eviction is being 
sought through the appropriate judicial process according to State or 
local law.
    2  The notice of termination is prepared and issued by the borrower 
or its authorized representative in accordance with the prior notice 
requirements and provisions of State or local law.
    3  If State or local law is silent or otherwise not explicit, the 
notice must state the

[[Page 277]]

reason and basis for the termination of occupancy (i.e., material or 
other good cause violation, or both).
    4  The notice of termination must include the location and regular 
office hours during which the tenant or member (or counsel) may view its 
file and copy any information it contains to aid in the tenant's 
member's defense.
    5  The notice will be accomplished in the same manner described at 
paragraph XIV B 2 of this exhibit.
    6  A copy of the notice of termination will simultaneously be 
forwarded to the Servicing Office.
    7  In those states where the notice of lease or occupancy agreement 
violation automatically becomes the notice of termination after a 
prescribed period of time, the requirements of the notice of termination 
have been met.
    D  Servicing Official review.
    1  Upon receipt of a copy of notice of termination, the Servicing 
Official shall promptly review the notice for technical compliance with 
paragraph XIV C of this exhibit and any applicable State Supplements. 
The Servicing Official will not review the notice for the merits of the 
action, nor express any opinion on the merits of the action (this 
responsibility resides with the State or local court).
    2  No further action is required if the notice of termination meets 
technical requirements of preparation.
    3  If the notice of termination fails to meet the technical 
requirements of preparation, the Servicing Official will:
    a  Inform the borrower how the notice of termination failed to meet 
the technical requirements of preparation,
    b  Inform the borrower to cease the action,
    c  Inform the borrower that it may reissue a new revised notice of 
termination if the borrower believes the conditions still warrant such 
action, and
    d  Send to the tenant a copy of the Servicing Official's letter that 
was sent to the borrower.
    E  Notice of eviction. A notice of eviction is prepared and issued 
by a court of law, not the borrower or its authorized representative. 
Eviction will be carried out as specified by the terms of the eviction 
notice and court order.
    XV  SECURITY SERVICING: Security servicing, as referenced in this 
exhibit, concerns the borrower's general responsibilities in relation to 
the loan agreement or resolution, note, mortgage, and other loan 
documents. It does not deal with security items between the borrower and 
the tenants or members. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 will look to the borrower to fulfill its obligation according to 
the requirements of the loan agreement or resolution, note, mortgage, 
and other legal or closing documents. Some items of special emphasis 
are:
    A  Fidelity coverage. It is the borrower's overall responsibility as 
described in the management plan to see that fidelity coverage is in 
place on any personnel entrusted with the receipt, custody, and 
disbursement of any project monies, securities, or readily saleable 
property other than money or securities. The borrower should have 
fidelity coverage in force as soon as there are assets within the 
organization and it must be obtained before any loan funds or interim 
financing funds are made available to the borrower. Coverage must be 
from a company licensed to provide coverage in the state where the 
project is located. Fidelity coverage obtained should utilize standard 
industry forms copyrighted by an organization such as the American 
Association of Insurance Services, or AAIS; Insurance Services Office, 
Inc., or ISO; or the Surety Association of America, or SSA. Use of the 
following guidelines will meet the administrative intent of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354:
    1  Fidelity coverage policies must declare in the insuring 
agreement(s) that the insurance company will provide protection to the 
insured against the loss of project money, securities, and property 
other than money and securities, through any criminal or dishonest act 
or acts committed by any ``employee,'' whether acting alone or in 
collusion with others, not to exceed the amount of indemnity stated in 
the declaration of coverage. The FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 minimally requires any insuring policy to include an 
insuring agreement that covers employee dishonesty.
    2  The types of coverage policies acceptable to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 are:
    a  Blanket crime policy. This type of policy usually provides the 
broader fidelity coverage and economy of cost options. Premiums are 
subject to discount based on the level of internal control exercised by 
the insured operation. This type of policy can provide the following 
insuring agreements:
    (1) Employee dishonesty--Form A, Blanket. (Required)
    (2) Loss inside the premises--Money and Securities Broad Form. 
(Recommended)
    (3) Loss outside the premises--Money and Securities Broad Form. 
(Recommended)
    (4) Depositor's forgery or alteration. (Recommended)
    b  Fidelity bond. Fidelity bonds limit coverage only to employee 
dishonesty. Fidelity bonds are generally used when one or two employees 
are covered. Premiums are based on established rate charges that are 
usually greater than for blanket crime policies.

[[Page 278]]

    (1) Schedule and position bonds. A schedule bond covers a named 
employee and is acquired with each change of employment. A position bond 
covers a named position of responsibility and permits continuous 
coverage even though the person holding that position changes. Of the 
two, a position bond is preferred by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354.
    (2) Blanket bonds. Blanket bonds cover all employees in either of 
two forms:
    (i) Commercial blanket bond (Form A). This bond limits coverage to 
each loss, irrespective of how many persons are involved. This form of 
bond is available on a ``standard'' basis.
    (ii) Blanket position bond (Form B). This bond limits coverage to 
each employee, hence it can provide greater protection if there is 
collusion of two or more persons. This is a nonstandard form of bond 
available from some insurance companies who use their own individualized 
forms.
    3  The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
requires only an endorsement listing all FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 financed properties and their locations covered 
under the policy or bond. The policy or bond may also include properties 
or operations other than FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 financed properties on separate endorsement listings.
    4  Individual or organizational borrowers will have fidelity 
coverage when they have employees with access to project assets as cited 
in paragraph XV A of this exhibit; otherwise, a management company with 
exclusive access to the borrower's assets will have the fidelity 
coverage.
    5  Borrowers who use a management agent with exclusive access to 
project assets as cited above will require the Agent to have fidelity 
coverage on all principals and employees with access to the project 
assets. Should active management revert to the borrower, the borrower 
will obtain fidelity coverage as specified in XV A 1 of this paragraph 
as a first course of business.
    6  Fidelity coverage is not required when a loan is made to an 
individual (a natural person) or a General Partnership and that person 
or general partner will be responsible for a project's financial 
activities. (An individual person cannot bond or obtain coverage against 
its own actions.)
    7  In the case of a land trust where the beneficiary is responsible 
for management, the beneficiary will be treated as an individual.
    8  A limited partnership will not be required to have fidelity 
coverage on its general partners UNLESS one or more of its general 
partners perform financial acts coming within the scope of the usual 
duties of an ``employee.''
    9  The minimum amount of fidelity coverage will be the amount 
calculated by multiplying an exposure index by a coverage factor. When 
the calculated amount is less than $10,000, minimum coverage of $10,000 
must be provided. This calculation is made as follows:
    a  Determine exposure index: Exposure index=25 percent of the SUM of 
annual cash receipts (rents, cash subsidy, interest, etc.) and cash 
(cash carryover, reserves, CD's, tax and insurance escrows, etc.). Round 
to next higher $1,000.
    b  Determine coverage: Coverage = exposure index  x  coverage factor 
taken from the coverage chart. Round to next higher $1000.
    c  Coverage chart:
      

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Coverage
                        Exposure index                           factor
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$100,000 or less.............................................        .30
$100,000 to $200,000.........................................        .28
$200,000 to $300,000.........................................        .26
$300,000 to $400,000.........................................        .24
$400,000 to $500,000.........................................        .22
$500,000 to $600,000.........................................        .20
$600,000 to $700,000.........................................        .18
$700,000 to $800,000.........................................        .16
$800,000 to $900,000.........................................        .14
$900,000 to $1,000,000.......................................        .12
$1,000,000 or more...........................................        .10
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    d  Example: $245,000 exposure index  x  26=$63,700 Minimum coverage 
(rounded) = $64,000
    10  A deductible is designed to allow flexibility in balancing what 
the project can prudently pay from its own assets, at a time of loss, 
against the economy of annual premiums in its annual budget. The 
following deductible levels will meet FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 requirements:
      

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              Deductible
                      Fidelity coverage                          level
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under 50,000................................................      $1,000
In the area of $100,000.....................................       2,500
In the area of $250,000.....................................       5,000
In the area of $500,000.....................................      10,000
In the area of $1,000,000...................................      15,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    11   When discussing fidelity coverage with its insurance agent, the 
borrower and/or management agent should inquire how it can improve its 
internal controls to reduce exposure to risk. Adoption of improvement 
measures may result in lower premiums.
    12   The premium for a borrower's fidelity coverage on project site 
employees is a project expense.
    13   The premium of a management agent's fidelity coverage for the 
agent's principals and employees will be the management agent's business 
expense (i.e., it is included within the management fee). When a project 
site employee is covered under the ``umbrella'' of the agent's fidelity 
coverage, the

[[Page 279]]

pro rata portion of the premium covering the employee may be considered 
a project expense.
    14   Fidelity coverage should be reviewed during annual review and 
adjusted when necessary.
    B   Insurance. The minimum amounts and types of insurance required 
of the borrower will be determined by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 in accordance with subparts A and B of part 1806 of 
this chapter (FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Instructions 426.1 and 426.2) except as otherwise described in this 
paragraph. All references to County Supervisor shall be construed to 
mean Servicing Official when applied to the multiple housing program. 
The borrower or its agent shall obtain:
    1   Adequate fire, extended coverage, and earthquake insurance as 
needed will be required on all buildings included as security for the 
loan or grant (see Guide Letter 1930-4 for requesting renewals). The 
amount of coverage will be not less than the ``Total Estimated 
Reproduction Cost New of Improvements,'' on page 5 of Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1922-7, ``Appraisal Report for 
Multi-Unit Housing.'' The following additional provisions will apply:
    a   An initial insurance policy with evidence of first year paid 
premium will be delivered to the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official at the time of loan closing or 
transfer of loan, providing at least 1 year of coverage.
    b   Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 426-
2, ``Property Insurance Mortgage Clause,'' or the provisions thereof 
printed in the policy or in a blanket letter from an insurance company, 
must be part of the policy; namely to provide FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354, as mortgagee, with at least 10 days 
advance notice of cancellation.
    c   Evidence of paid premium in subsequent years will not be 
required.
    d   Any change of insurance provider or level of coverage or term, 
will be provided to the Servicing Official by use of part VII ``Notice 
of Change to Borrower/Project Status,'' of Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7.
    2   Suitable Worker's Compensation Insurance on all its employees. 
Worker's Compensation Insurance for employees of a management agent 
shall be paid out of the agent's management fee. When a project site 
employee is covered under the ``umbrella'' of the agent's insurance, the 
portion of premium attributable to a project site employee may be a 
project expense.
    3   Adequate liability insurance.
    4   Flood insurance when the project is located in a designated 
flood hazard area.
    5   A blanket insurance policy may be accepted from a borrower when 
blanket coverage is more cost effective for each FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 financed project on a prorata basis, and 
an endorsement is attached to the policy listing FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 financed projects, locations, and 
coverage limits separate from any other properties covered by the 
policy.
    C   Real estate and personal property taxes. All borrowers will be 
required to pay their taxes before they become delinquent and provide 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 with proof of 
payment (see Guide Letter 1930-7 to remind borrowers to pay taxes). An 
exception to the above may be made if the borrower has formally 
contested the amount of the property assessment and had escrowed the 
amount of taxes in question in a manner acceptable to the Servicing 
Official.
    XVI   Automation of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 Forms and Formats: The various forms and formats approved or 
prescribed for use by borrowers and their agents throughout this subpart 
may be prepared on automated systems when the following criteria is 
complied with:
    A   FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 forms 
approved for official use by OMB.
    1   The identical wording and nomenclature of an official form must 
be included in the automated version of the form, including the OMB 
approval number.
    2   The function (i.e., logic or mathematical calculation) of an 
official form must be the same in an automated version of the form.
    3   The name or logo of the source of an automated form must be 
visibly annotated on each output of the automated form.
    4   Nominal spacing adjustment of the content of an official form on 
the automated format is permitted to accommodate limitations of 
automation software and hardware.
    5   Output size must be 8\1/2\ inches  x  11 inches.
    6   Output on colored paper is permissible but not required by FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    B   Unofficial FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
formats. Items such as management plans, management agreements, waiting 
lists, and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 guide 
letters should be automated to the extent possible. Content and 
completion of the format must be developed according to FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 guidelines for the item.

Exhibit B-1 to Subpart C--Management Plan Requirements for Farmers Home 
Administration or Its Successor Agency Under Public Law 103-354 Financed 
                 Multiple Family Housing (MFH) Projects

    The objective of a management plan is to describe the property 
owner's expectations and standards for performance, timing, and results 
of management of all aspects of the various components of property 
operation, maintenance, and compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. This exhibit is intended to guide the owner in identifying 
the various components of property management in an organized manner. 
The listing of discussion items under each component is intended as 
further guidance. Items should be added if needed; likewise, those items 
listed and not applicable to a given property situation need not be 
addressed.
    FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 requires 
management of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
financed MFH projects to be in compliance with applicable Federal, 
State, and local laws and this regulation. Exhibit B-4 of this subpart 
will be used by a prospective management agent to provide a resume of 
management background and/or experience. Exhibit B-5 of this subpart 
will be used by an owner who proposes to provide direct project 
management. In rural cooperative housing (RCH), a cooperative's board of 
directors will manage the business of the cooperative with the 
assistance of the adviser to the board. If the board is unable, in the 
adviser's opinion, to manage the cooperative after an adequate period of 
training, then FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
will make the determination of whether the cooperative will hire 
professional management.
    FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will review 
the management plan to evaluate the borrower's standards for project 
management. The management plan and any subsequent revisions must be 
signed by the borrower, and then approved and signed by the authorized 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 official. No loan 
will be closed or construction started, or loan transfer completed, 
without a properly approved and signed management plan. Management plans 
should be reviewed annually and updated at least triannually by the 
borrower. Any updated or modified management plan will need to be 
reviewed and approved by the Servicing Official at the time of annual 
review. When only a few changes are needed, use of an addendum to the 
plan is acceptable to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354.
    A management plan will reflect understanding of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 program requirements for the 
project and address each of the following areas:
    1  The role and responsibility of the owner and the relationship and 
delegations of authority to the management agent. A management agreement 
must be provided where a management agent is to be used. If there is no 
management agent, the management plan should supply the equivalent 
information concerning the management staff assigned to day-to-day 
operation of the project even when the owner provides direct management.
    a  Describe and fully justify any identity of interest as described 
in paragraph V B of exhibit B of this subpart.
    b  Identify the supervisory relationships, and to whom the incumbent 
of the position responsible for the day-to-day operation of the project 
is accountable.
    c  Describe the conditions when the management agent must consult 
the owner before taking any action.
    d  Identify the person or position in the owner's organization that 
is the key contact for the management agency. Describe the type of 
decisions to be made by this contact person.
    e  Describe the fundamental responsibilities and duties of the owner 
and the managing agent. Identify any areas of overlap and describe how 
the overlap will be handled.
    f  Describe any pro rata divisions of singularly incurred operating 
expense that is common to the management agent and the owner (project) 
(i.e., fidelity coverage that may be divided between both).
    2  Personnel policy and staffing arrangements.
    a  Describe hiring practices of management and their conformance 
with equal employment opportunity requirements.
    b  Include a staffing plan for the project.
    c  Describe the lines of authority, responsibility, and 
accountability (internal controls) within the management entity.
    d  Describe the standards and plans for training and familiarizing 
employees with their job related responsibilities and applicable FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 program requirements. 
Describe how such training will generally be achieved.
    3  Plans and procedures for marketing units, achieving and 
maintaining full occupancy, and meeting HUD Form 935.2, ``Affirmative 
Fair Housing Marketing Plan,'' requirements.
    a  Describe how affirmative marketing practices will be used. 
Describe the outreach and marketing efforts that will be used to reach 
those low-income and minority persons who are least likely to apply for 
such housing without special outreach efforts.
    b  Describe the methods that will be used to achieve and maintain 
the highest possible level of occupancy. When applicable, indicate any 
additional compensation or incentives

[[Page 281]]

that may be allowed management agents for early initial rent-up. (If 
this area is not covered in the management plan, it will usually not be 
allowed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 at a 
later date.)
    c  Describe how the units will be advertised. Indicate minimum 
levels planned regardless of occupancy levels.
    d  Describe the appropriate communication system, auxiliary aids, or 
other assistance that will be used to ensure effective communication 
with applicants, tenants or members, and members of the public that have 
sight or hearing impairments.
    e  Describe the kinds of reasonable accommodation the project can 
readily provide such as changing water faucets, kitchen equipment, door 
knobs, assigning handicap parking spaces, etc.
    f  Describe the process management will follow in reviewing and 
determining whether structural modification of an apartment unit is 
practical and feasible to reasonably accommodate a tenant or household 
member who has a handicap or disability.
    g  Indicate whether the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 sample waiting list (exhibit B-14 of this subpart) or some 
other waiting list will be used. If another waiting list is used, 
indicate how its use will otherwise comply with FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 guidelines.
    h  Attach copies of sample forms that will be used to record unit 
condition, and indicate who will receive copies of the inspection forms.
    i  Describe any orientation services to be provided tenants or 
members to acquaint them with the project and care of the units. 
Indicate what printed project information will be given to applicants.
    j  Identify the person or staff position responsible for determining 
tenant or member eligibility and their location on the waiting list.
    k  In projects receiving tax credits, describe how special waiting 
lists will be established and when eligible tenants with incomes higher 
than tax credit limits will be considered for occupancy.
    4  Procedures for determining eligibility and for certifying and 
recertifying incomes.
    a  Describe how applications and other records relevant to this 
function will be kept. If application fees are used, describe them.
    b  Describe the level of knowledge, skill, and ability that 
management official(s) will be expected to possess before assuming 
rental related duties such as application processing, eligibility 
determination, selection, unit assignment, certification, 
recertification, rent or occupancy charge collection, and recordkeeping. 
This discussion should mention training and testing to be provided or 
obtained to achieve and maintain the level expected.
    c  Identify whether project funds or the management agent will pay 
overage when overage is due through no fault of the tenant or member.
    5  Leasing and occupancy policies.
    a  Describe the occupancy standards for the project. (This could be 
shown as an annex to the management plan.)
    b  Describe the project admissions and leasing/occupancy policies 
and procedures, and criteria for selecting tenants/members for 
occupancy. (This could be shown as an annex to the management plan.)
    c  Describe the level of knowledge, skill, and ability that 
management official(s) will be expected to understand and apply 
regarding project lease provisions and prohibitions, occupancy 
standards, and admissions policies.
    d  Describe special procedures that will be used where the marketing 
area includes non-English speaking or reading persons to assure that 
such persons will understand leases or occupancy agreements and 
established rules.
    6  Rent and occupancy charge collection policies and procedures.
    a  Describe the project rent/occupancy charge collection policy and 
procedure, covering such matters as where the collection point is, which 
staff position handles the collection, provisions for collection after 
normal office hours, recording, and safeguarding of collections.
    b  Describe the project security deposit/membership fee policy and 
procedure covering matters similar to the preceding item. Include 
discussion on handling of any interest earned on such deposits.
    7  Procedures for requesting and implementing a rent or occupancy 
charge change.
    a  Describe the process to be followed for preparation and request 
of a change of rents/occupancy charges and/or utility allowances, and to 
notify tenants of such change, to meet FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 requirements.
    b  Identify which staff position or person will process change 
requests.
    c  Describe when such change requests will normally be made in terms 
of economic need and timing within a fiscal year of operation.
    8  Plans and procedures for carrying out an effective maintenance, 
repair, and replacement program.
    a  Describe the project objective and general plan for preventive 
maintenance.
    b  Describe where the project's as-built plans and specifications 
will be located and identify the staff position responsible for updating 
it as modifications occur.
    c  Describe the general maintenance procedures and schedules or 
cycles to: (this list could be attached as an addendum)

[[Page 282]]

    (1) Check and service appliances and mechanical equipment.
    (2) Perform safety checks of smoke/fire alarms, fire extinguishers, 
outside lighting, and ice removal, etc.

    Exhibit B-2 to Subpart C--Requirements for Management Agreements

    A completed and executed management agreement must be reviewed and 
approved by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 whenever a management agent is to be 
used. A management agreement must be submitted to FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 for review as part of a project loan 
docket, whenever there is a change of management agents or ownership, or 
when a major revision of an existing agreement is necessary or required.
    1  A written management agreement is required for any project when 
the owner retains a management agent. A management agreement is not 
required when the project is managed by the owner as described in 
paragraph V E 6 of exhibit B of this subpart. However, a written 
management plan is required for all projects new and existing, except 
for on-farm labor housing units where rent is not required. Although the 
adviser to a cooperative board of directors is not the same type of 
agent as those who are now managing rental projects, a written agreement 
between the board and the adviser is required which sets forth their 
relationship and what the adviser is expected to do for the cooperative. 
Exhibits F, F-1, and G of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter outline 
the functions and responsibilities of an adviser. The agreement may 
follow the content of exhibit B-3 of this subpart.
    2  The management agreement must address how FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 requirements will be met. The owner may 
delegate to the agent any management duties which are not required to be 
performed by the owner. The

[[Page 284]]

owner may delegate selected ownership responsibilities, such as requests 
for review and/or appeal of adverse decisions by third parties that 
affect the owner. However, the owner remains totally responsible to FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for all aspects of 
management.
    3  The management plan is the primary management charter, 
constituting a comprehensive description of the policies and procedures 
to be followed in managing the project. The management agreement 
describes how the objectives and policies in the management plan will be 
carried out. The agreement should be clear and concise, should not 
merely repeat the management plan, but indicate how the management agent 
will implement the plan.
    4  The management agreement shall describe the management agent's 
organization and staffing structure, management controls, and any 
management company identity of interest relationship(s) such as the 
borrower, vendors, and suppliers of materials, labor, and services. When 
such relationships exist, the management agent shall prepare and sign 
the forms described in paragraph V B 2 a of exhibit B of this subpart as 
``applicant''.
    5  The management agreement sets forth the standards and 
expectations negotiated between the borrower and the management agent. 
The agreement should follow the guidelines of exhibit B-3 of this 
subpart. Each management agreement should be tailored to the specific 
conditions and staffing arrangements of the particular project. The 
site, design, size of the project, and fiscal constraints; market 
conditions; social factors; local law; and business practices are among 
the elements which may require variations to exhibit B-3 of this 
subpart.

and furnish the Owner with full reports on all accidents, claims, and 
potential claims for damage relating to the project, and will cooperate 
with the owner's insurers in connection therewith.
    L  Taxes, fees and assessments. The Agent shall provide for the 
payment from project funds all taxes, assessments, and government fees 
for the owner promptly when due and payable. The Agent shall also 
evaluate local property taxes to determine if they bear a fair 
relationship to the project value and if they do not, at the direction 
of the Owner, appeal such taxes on behalf of the Owner or assist the 
Owner in the appeal, whichever is required by local jurisdiction or is 
appropriate.
    M  Employees and/or services. The Agent will employ persons and/or 
services, (or will manage persons and/or services employed by the Owner)

will be paid as a direct expense to the project as specified in the 
management plan and this agreement. The Agent will employ sufficient 
resources (staff and/or services) within the Agent's operation to 
fulfill Agent's obligation to the Owner under the terms of this 
agreement.
    VI  Project accounts. The Agent will maintain and safeguard the 
Owner's project financial accounts and tenant security deposit accounts 
according to the current requirements set forth in paragraph XIII B 2 of 
exhibit B of subpart C of part 1930 of this chapter, which is part of 
the ``Multiple Housing Management Handbook.''
    VII  Agent's compensation, tenure, and identification.
    A  Agent's compensation. The Agent will be compensated for its 
services for providing management described under this agreement, and 
the Owner's management plan, by monthly fees, to be paid from the 
general operating account and treated as a project operation and 
maintenance expense. Such fees will be payable on the first day of each 
month for the preceding month. Each monthly fee will be in an amount 
computed as follows:
    (The following are acceptable methods in no order of preference. Any 
other method of compensation will be fully described and inserted in 
this section.) The costs incurred by the Agent for performing the

    3. % of basic rents collected. (Plan II)
    Maximum annual compensation under this agreement and the approved

    B  Term of agreement. This agreement shall be in effect for a period 
of not more than 3 years, beginning on the ____ day of ____, 19____, 
subject, however, to the following conditions:
    1  This agreement will not be binding upon the Principal Parties 
until approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    2  This agreement may be terminated by mutual consent of the 
principal parties as of the end of any calendar month, provided that at 
least 30 days advance written notice thereof with reasons given is 
submitted to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    3  In the event that a petition in bankruptcy is filed by or against 
either of the Principal Parties, or in the event that either makes an 
assignment for the benefit of creditors or takes advantage of any 
insolvency act, the other party may terminate this agreement without 
notice to the other, provided that prompt written notice with reasons 
given for such termination is submitted FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354.
    4  It is expressly understood and agreed by and between the 
Principal Parties that the State Director may terminate this agreement 
with cause upon the issuance of a 30-day written notice of cancellation 
to each of the Principal Parties. It is further understood and agreed 
that no liability will attach to either of the Principal Parties in the 
event of such termination.
    5  Upon termination of this agreement, the Agent will submit to the 
Owner all project books and records and any financial statements 
required by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. 
After the Principal Parties have accounted to each other with respect to 
all matters outstanding as of the date of termination, the Owner will 
furnish the Agent security, in form and Principal amount satisfactory to 
the Agent, against any obligations or liabilities which the Agency may 
properly have incurred on behalf of the Owner hereunder.
    C  Agent's indemnification. Notwithstanding any provision of this 
agreement or any obligation of Agent hereunder, it is understood and 
agreed: that Owner has assumed and will maintain its responsibility and 
obligation throughout the term of this agreement for the finances and 
the financial stability of the project; and that Agent shall

[[Page 289]]

have no obligation, responsibility, or liability to fund authorized 
project costs, expenses, or accounts other than those funds generated by 
the project itself or provided to the project or to Agent by Owner. In 
accordance with the foregoing, Owner agrees that Agent shall have the 
right at all times to secure payment of its compensation, as provided 
for under paragraph VII A of this agreement, from the operating and 
maintenance account, immediately when such compensation is due and 
without regard to other project obligations or expenses provided the 
Agent has satisfactorily discharged all duties and responsibilities 
under this agreement. Moreover, Owner hereby indemnifies Agent and 
agrees to hold it harmless with respect to project costs, expenses, 
accounts, liabilities, and obligations during the term of this agreement 
and further agrees to guarantee to Agent the payment of its compensation 
under paragraph VII A of this agreement during the term of this 
agreement to the extent that the project's operating and maintenance 
account is insufficiently funded for this purpose. Failure of Owner at 
any time to abide by and to fulfill the foregoing shall be a breach of 
this agreement entitling Agent to obtain from Owner, upon demand, full 
payment of all compensation owned to Agent through the date of such 
breach and entitling Agent, at its option, to terminate this agreement 
forthwith.
    VIII  Interpretative provisions.
    A  This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Owner 
and the Agent with respect to the management and operation of the 
project. No change will be valid unless made by supplemental written 
agreement approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354.
    B  This agreement has been executed in several counterparts, each of 
which shall constitute a complete original agreement, which may be 
introduced in evidence or used for any other purpose without production 
of any of the other counterparts.
    C  This agreement is NOT in full force and effect unless and until 
concurred with by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    D  At all times, this agreement will be subject and subordinate to 
all rights of the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, 
and will work to the benefit of and constitute a binding obligation upon 
the Principal parties and their respective successors and assigns. To 
the extent that this agreement confers rights upon the consenting 
parties, it will be deemed to work to their benefit, but without 
liability to either, in the same manner and work with the same effect as 
though the consenting parties were primary parties to the agreement.
    The Principal Parties [by their duly authorized officers] have 
executed this agreement on the date first above written.

                        Waiting List Instructions

    This sample waiting list may be used as a model in developing a 
project waiting list. It combines income level and unit size groupings 
on one page. Separate pages for
different income levels or unit sizes are an option.
    Waiting lists need to be updated periodically by carrying forward 
active applications and removing applications that have become tenants 
or members or have been withdrawn.
This should be done with sufficient frequency so that a substantial 
number of lines on the waiting list are filled with active applications. 
Retired waiting lists must be kept through the next compliance review 
performed by Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354.

                          Description of Input:

    1. Project name--Self-explanatory.
    2. Location--Project location name.
    3. Application No.--This is the sequential number of the order by 
which the completed application was received. This may be a continual 
sequence from a given start date or it may be the sequential number in a 
particular year. Example: 93-3 denotes the third application received in 
1993.
    4. Date/time--The date and time a completed application is received.
    5. Name/address--Name of applicant and current street and/or mailing 
address.
    6. Phone number--Applicant's current phone number or a contact 
person's phone number.
    7. Race code--Local management should use a code known to itself of 
the code provided in Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1944-8, ``Tenant Certification.'' Use letters or numbers or a 
combination of both. Do not state or abbreviate racial or ethnic 
descriptions.
    8. Household size--The total number of people who will actually 
occupy a unit.
    9. Blank column--For optional use; for labor housing purposes.
    10. Displaced priority--If applicant possesses a letter of priority 
entitlement (LOPE) issued by FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 or from other assisted housing enter yes/LOPE. If applicant 
is displaced due to a natural disaster or catastrophe, housing rendered 
uninhabitable, or seized by legal action (other than for illegal 
activity) enter yes/other. Enter no if applicant is not a displacee.
    Note: Section 8 applicants who at time of housing need are 
involuntarily displaced, living in substandard housing, or paying more 
than 50 percent of family income for rent have priority over other 
Section 8 applicants.
    11. Income level--Enter a checkmark under the income level 
determined by income verification.
    12. Unit size--Enter a checkmark under each unit size the applicant 
is qualified to occupy or deems appropriate to its need. Circle the 
checkmark denoting the size requested. Legend: VL--Very low-income, L--
Low-income, M--Moderate-income, I--Ineligible.
    13. Rental assistance eligibility--Indicate whether or not the 
income level qualifies the applicant to receive rental assistance (RA). 
(If RA is being used in the project).
    14. Blank column--For optional use. It could denote Sec. 8 handicap 
status, elderly family status, LH status, or tax credit eligibility 
status.
    15. Dates contacted for occupancy--Enter the dates management 
contacted or attempted to contact the applicant to offer an apartment 
for occupancy. Note the method of contact and the results.
    16. Lease date--Fill in date of Lease to denote that applicant has 
changed to tenant status.
    17. Removal date--Enter date of removal from the waiting list, when 
applicable.
    18. Comments--Self-explanatory.

   Exhibit C to Subpart C--Rental and Occupancy Charge and/or Utility 
                            Allowance Changes

                              I. Objectives

    This exhibit prescribes the method of processing changes in the 
monthly rental or occupancy charge rates for tenants or members in 
Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or

[[Page 299]]

its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Rural Rental Housing 
(RRH), Rural Cooperative Housing (RCH), and Labor Housing (LH) projects. 
This exhibit covers all RRH, RCH, and LH loans (except ``nonrental'' LH 
loans), including those approved before the date of this subpart.

                             II. Definitions

    A. Approval official. State Director or designated State and 
Servicing Office staff with delegated authority according to 
Sec. 1930.143 of this subpart.
    B. Utility. Sewer, water, trash collection, electricity, natural 
gas, and any other fuel used specifically for cooking, heating, and/or 
cooling.
    C. Rental or occupancy charge rate (rental or occupancy charge). The 
term rental rate means RRH or LH project rent rates that include 
utilities; or net project rent rates plus an allowance for utilities, 
either of which should be equal in value. In RCH projects, the term 
occupancy charge means the charge for occupancy including utilities; or 
the net charge for occupancy exclusive of an allowance for utilities 
according to the operating plan of the cooperative.

                III. Initial Understanding With Borrower

    A. All RRH, RCH, and LH applicants will be informed at the 
application stage of the agency's rental or occupancy charge change 
procedure. All borrowers will be advised that any proposed rent or 
occupancy charge changes must comply with this exhibit. Utility 
allowance changes will comply with this exhibit and exhibit A-6 of 
subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter. This exhibit will also apply to 
rental changes resulting from the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development's (HUD) Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors for units 
receiving section 8 assistance. Request for a rental or occupancy charge 
change will be based on a realistic projected budget for the interim 
year or the ensuing full year.
    B. Rental or occupancy charge change policies.
    1. Rental or occupancy charge rates in projects financed in whole or 
in part by an RRH, RCH, or LH loan may not be raised without FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 written consent according to 
requirements in loan agreements, loan resolutions, and other instruments 
executed in connection with RRH, RCH, and LH loans.
    2. Changes requiring only prior FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 review are those which are beyond the borrowers' 
control to cover changes in taxes or utilities, and changes which do not 
result in an increase in the tenant's or member's total shelter cost.
    3. Borrowers are encouraged to have the effective date of needed 
changes coincide with the start of their fiscal year or with the start 
of the season in the case of LH projects occupied on a seasonal basis.
    4. Change requests normally should be made 60 to 90 days prior to 
the end of the borrower's fiscal year.
    5. It is anticipated that rental or occupancy charge changes would 
not be necessary more frequently than once a year.
    6. Changes in rental or occupancy charge rates will apply to all 
units in the project.
    7. Projects with operating budgets that consistently generate a 
surplus of unrestricted cash greater than 10 percent of project yearly 
expense (exclusive of any qualifying refund of 2 percent initial 
operating capital contribution) should reduce their rental or occupancy 
charge rates.
    8. Current tenant or member certifications on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8, ``Tenant 
Certification,'' or other form approved by FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 must be on file in the Servicing Office.
    C. All borrowers are encouraged to participate in the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 rental assistance (RA) 
program. However, unless the Administrator notifies State and Servicing 
Offices otherwise, all borrowers with projects meeting the eligibility 
requirements of paragraph II B of exhibit E of this subpart, except full 
profit borrowers, will be automatically treated as having applied for 
rental assistance, since section 530 of title V of the Housing Act of 
1949, as amended, requires such consideration.
    D. Borrowers must accept RA when it is available and it appears that 
a rental or occupancy charge change will cause any very low or low-
income tenant to pay in excess of 30 percent of adjusted monthly income 
for shelter costs. If FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 does not have RA appropriation available for this purpose, the 
borrower is encouraged to use other sources of governmental subsidies. 
The availability or unavailability of governmental subsidies will not 
preclude FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 from 
processing a rental or occupancy charge change request. The borrower 
will retain the option of submitting an RA request at any time that it 
appears that any verylow- or low-income tenant cannot pay in excess of 
30 percent of adjusted monthly income in shelter costs, even without a 
rent change action. In such cases, the borrower must apply for RA on 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-25, 
``Request for Rental Assistance,'' unless such form is already on file 
at the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing 
Office.
    E. Even though RA is not available, borrowers are encouraged to 
convert to Interest

[[Page 300]]

Credit Plan II to give tenants and members the most favorable rental 
rates possible.

 IV. Borrower's Responsibility in Processing Rental or Occupancy Charge 
    Change Requests Which Change Housing Costs to Tenants or Members

    A. When an RRH, RCH, or LH borrower determines that a project rental 
or occupancy charge change is needed, the borrower must meet or consult 
with the Servicing Office staff, unless such requirement is waived by 
the Servicing Office, to review the following information before the 
``Notice to Tenants (members) of Proposed Rent (Occupancy Charge) and 
Utility Allowance Change,'' exhibit C-1 of this subpart, is posted and 
delivered to the tenants or members:
    1. Facts demonstrating the need and justification for a rental or 
occupancy charge change in accordance with paragraph III A of this EX.
    2. A new operating budget for the borrower fiscal year showing:
    a. Currently approved budget at old rents or occupancy charges.
    b. Actual income and expenses to date.
    c. Proposed budget at proposed new basic rents or occupancy charges.
    d. Proposed budget at proposed new note rate rents or occupancy 
charges (when applicable).
    3. An application for RA is considered to have been automatically 
filed with the Agency. However, the borrower may submit an application 
for RA at any time on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1944-25, if the borrower's project is an eligible project and 
the proposed change will cause any very low- and low-income tenants or 
members to pay in excess of 30 percent of adjusted monthly income for 
shelter costs.
    4. A new energy audit, if one is due, or a listing of deferred 
improvements identified in a previous energy audit that were performed 
within the past 5-year period according to the requirements of exhibit D 
of this subpart.
    5. Information on actual utility costs for representative units in 
the project and, whenever any utility allowance was approved over 12 
months ago, an updated exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 1944 of this 
chapter when tenants or members pay their own utilities.
    6. Any other information the borrower believes necessary to justify 
the proposed shelter cost change.
    B. Required actions and timeframes for shelter cost changes. 
Requests for shelter cost changes (i.e. changes to the rent and/or 
utility allowance) may be submitted at any time, however, the Agency 
encourages such requests to be submitted within the last quarter of the 
calendar year in conjunction with the annual budget review.
    1. Agency action.
    a. The Agency must act on any shelter cost change request and take 
one of the following actions within 25 days of its receipt:
    (1) Review the request package and if it is incomplete, return it to 
the borrower/manager, advising what additional information is needed, or
    (2) Request a meeting with the borrower/manager and state the 
proposed meeting date. The request should inform the borrower/manager of 
the purpose of the meeting. When a meeting is held, the Servicing 
Official will either:
    (i) Approve posting of the proposed rental or occupancy charge 
change and advise the borrower in writing to post the notice, or
    (ii) If the proposed change as submitted is not acceptable, the 
Servicing Official and the borrower/manager will arrive at a mutually 
acceptable change, and the Servicing Official will authorize in writing, 
posting of the agreed to revised figure, OR
    (iii) Reject posting of the proposed change, advise the borrower in 
writing to not post the notice and advise the borrower of their appeal 
or review rights in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this 
chapter.
    (3) If the borrower/manager does not attend the proposed meeting or 
other mutually agreed date, the change request will be considered 
withdrawn and returned to the borrower/manager, or
    (4) The Servicing Official may waive the meeting requirement and 
authorize the posting subject to any minor changes or other requirements 
listed, if any, or
    (5) Allowing posting of the request by not taking action on the 
request (de facto posting approval).
    b. Once a rental or occupancy charge change has been permitted to be 
posted, the only decision that can be made is to ``approve'' or 
``reject,'' which would be based on material concerns in comments of the 
tenants or members. When the request is rejected, the borrower will be 
advised of any appeal or review rights in accordance with subpart B of 
part 1900 of this chapter.
    2. Borrower action. When approval to post notice is given by FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the borrower is required 
to:
    a. Notify tenants or members.
    (1) Tenants or members must be notified in writing at least 60 days 
before the anticipated effective date of change using exhibit C-1 of 
this subpart. The written notice may be delivered by mail or by other 
means. In addition, the borrower must post at least one notice in a 
visible place at the project site.
    (2) Tenant or member comment period. Tenants or members will be 
informed of their right to submit comments to the Servicing Office 
during the 20-day period following the date of the notice. Tenants or 
members will also be informed of their rights to inspect

[[Page 301]]

and copy records on file with the Agency, which are related to the 
request, throughout the 20-day period.
    b. Notify the Agency. The Agency must be given a copy of the written 
and dated notification which was mailed or delivered to the tenants or 
members.
    3. Implementation timeframes. Shelter cost changes cannot be 
implemented until such time as the tenants or members are informed of 
the changed rates. When increases are involved, tenants or members must 
be informed at least 30 days in advance of their effectiveness or such 
longer time as State law may prescribe. Tenants or members receiving 
notice of a shelter cost increase via the use of exhibit C-1 of this 
subpart will already have been ``informed at least 30 days in advance'' 
and need not receive a second notice provided the final approval action 
(i.e., See exhibit C-2 of this subpart) does not change the shelter cost 
rate established in exhibit C-1.

 V. Determination by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
                                   354

    A. Actions by servicing official. The Servicing Official will not 
consider a rental or occupancy charge change application complete and 
acceptable until the borrower has complied with all terms listed in 
paragraph IV of this exhibit. When the application and all attachments 
for the proposed change have been received (including the tenant or 
member comments when notification is required), the Agency will:
    1. Review all the material submitted.
    2. Review a copy of the borrower's latest Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29, ``Project Worksheet for 
Interest Credit and Rental Assistance.''
    3. Determine if RA is available for an eligible project on behalf of 
the low-income tenants or members. If RA is available, and it is 
apparent from record sources that at least one tenant is eligible for 
RA, the Servicing Office staff must require the borrower to apply for RA 
if an application for RA using Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944.25 is not already on file at the Servicing 
Office.
    4. When the change is requested for energy saving improvements 
identified in an energy audit, the Servicing Official shall determine 
the cost effectiveness and financial impact of the proposed improvements 
from information contained in the energy audit. The Servicing Official's 
determination will be made according to paragraph VI of exhibit D of 
this subpart.
    5. When State Office approval is required, the Servicing Office will 
submit to the State Director (see Guide Letter 1930-3 for outlining the 
change request package being submitted):
    a. Appropriate recommendations on the request,
    b. An indication of the number of tenants or members who will need 
RA as a result of the rent changes,
    c. All the material received from the borrower, including tenant or 
member comments or objections at the end of the 20-day comment period, 
and
    d. A short narrative describing the general tone and material 
content of tenant or member comments and concerns.
    6. When a member of the Servicing Office staff is the approval 
official, the documentation required by paragraph V A 5 of this exhibit, 
will be attached to the rent change request.
    7. When the borrower has requested RA, complete Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-25 and forward it to the 
State Director.
    B. Actions by the approval official. When the application, 
attachments, and comments are received, the approval official will 
review the material to determine if the change is justified and act on 
the request within 25 days. The borrower will be notified by the 
Approval Official of the determination within 45 days from the date the 
``Notice to Tenants (Members) of Proposed Rent (Occupancy Charge) and 
Utility Allowance Change'' (Exhibit C-1 of this subpart) is posted, 
otherwise the request will be considered approved.
    1. Approval actions.
    a. When a change is approved, the Approval Official will notify the 
borrower by using exhibit C-2 of this subpart. The notice letter 
(Exhibit C-2 of this subpart) will be prepared using the required and/or 
optional paragraphs as applicable. The reasons for the approved rent 
change should be concise. The notice letter will be mailed or hand 
delivered to each tenant or member and posted in a conspicuous 
places(s).
    b. When the borrower's project is operated on a profit basis and the 
purpose of the rental change is for: justified operating and maintenance 
expense; funding the reserve account; other project expenses; and 
providing or maintaining a profit, the change may be allowed as long as 
eligible tenants can afford the new rental rate.
    2. Disapproval actions. When the Servicing Official determines an 
application for a proposed rental or occupancy charge change is not 
justified on the basis of the information submitted, the Servicing 
Official will notify the borrower in writing of the reason(s) why the 
change is not approved. The borrower will be advised of their appeal 
rights in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. Rental 
or occupancy charge changes may not be approved when any of the 
following circumstances exist:

[[Page 302]]

    a. The borrower is able but unwilling: To comply with applicable 
tenant eligibility requirements; the audit and reporting requirements of 
this subpart; or, the conditions set forth in the borrower's loan 
agreement or resolution, interest credit and/or rental assistance 
agreement, promissory note, or mortgage.
    b. The budget for the project reflects sufficient income at the 
present rental or occupancy charge structure to meet operation and 
maintenance expenses which are appropriate and reasonable in amount, 
meet the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 debt 
service requirements, meet the required reserve account deposit, and 
provide a return to the borrower, when appropriate.
    c. The borrower's project is operated on a profit basis and the 
proposed rental change is for purposes other than meeting operation and 
maintenance expenses and debt service (i.e., the purpose is to allow 
excessive profits and the proposed rental change will result in rental 
rates in excess of what eligible tenants can afford).e State Director is 
able to provide RA to the project and the borrower's project is operated 
on a nonprofit basis, or a limited profit basis (as defined in 
Sec. 1944.205 of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter); but the 
borrower has not applied for RA within the most recent period of 180 
days prior to the rental change request or otherwise already has an 
application for RA on file at the Servicing Office on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-25.

           VI. Unauthorized Rental or Occupancy Charge Changes

    When a borrower implements a change that does not meet the 
requirements of this exhibit, the borrower will be notified in writing 
that: the change has not been authorized; and the rates must be rolled 
back to the last FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
authorized level. Tenants or members affected by the unauthorized change 
will be given a rebate or credit for the unauthorized amounts 
retroactive to the date of the unauthorized change. Those borrowers that 
fail to comply the provisions of this paragraph will be handled 
according to Sec. 1965.85(d) of subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter 
or paragraph X of this exhibit.

           VII. Annual Adjustment Factors for Section 8 Units

    A. HUD allowance of change.
    1. If the Servicing Official disapproves a rental rate change, or 
approves a lesser amount than permitted by HUD, as a result of HUD's 
annual adjustment factors for units receiving Section 8 assistance, the 
Servicing Official must require the borrower to deposit any excess 
funds, the difference between the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 approved note rate rent and the higher HUD authorized 
rental rate, into the reserve account.
    2. If this results in an accumulation of funds in the reserve 
account behind the sum shown in the loan agreement or loan resolution, 
the interest credit reduction on a Section 8/515 project should be 
adjusted or canceled through field office terminals.
    3. This adjustment or cancellation can be done without borrower 
consent for projects with interest credit agreements dated on or after 
October 27, 1980. For projects with interest credit agreements dated 
before October 27, 1980, this cancellation or reduction of interest 
credit may occur only with the borrower's written consent.
    4. When interest credit cannot be canceled or reduced, the Agency 
will collect overage. Overage, for each tenant, in this instance is the 
difference between the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 interest credit reduced rate rent and the lesser of the FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 note rate rent or the HUD 
contract rent. The total overage collected should not exceed an amount 
equal to the interest credit authorized by the interest credit agreement 
for the period of time covered by the loan payment installment.
    5. Even though interest credit is canceled or nullified by 
collecting overage, the borrower will still be required to operate on a 
limited profit basis.
    B. HUD disallowance of change. If HUD will not allow an annual 
adjustment of rents, and the project operating budget justifies need for 
rent(s) greater than HUD's contract rent(s), the State Director only may 
authorize conversion from a plan of 1 or 2 percent interest reduction 
(Interest Credit Plan II) to a plan of debt amortization at 1 percent 
interest plus overage up to the HUD contract rent(s) level by meeting 
the requirements of paragraph IV A2e of exhibit B of this subpart.
    C. Reviewing budgets where HUD subsidies are involved. FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 has the responsibility to 
review and approve project budgets based on need to meet the cash flow 
and expense requirements without regard to HUD's automatic annual 
adjustment. Since HUD and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 approved rent rates frequently differ, it may be necessary to 
have a 3 column budget in projects with Section 8 Housing Assistance 
Program (HAP) agreements. (Refer to the examples shown in paragraph VIID 
of this exhibit).
    1. When HUD contract rent and the 1 or 2 percent reduced rate are 
the same. In a project where 100 percent of the units receive Section 8 
(100 percent Section 8 projects), and the HUD contract rent rate and the 
1 or 2 percent reduced rate are the same, only the

[[Page 303]]

HUD contract rent rate column on the budget is needed.
    2. When HUD contract rent falls between the 1 or 2 percent reduced 
rate and the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 note 
rate. In a 100 percent Section 8 project where the HUD contract rental 
rate falls between the 1 or 2 percent reduced rate rent and the note 
rate rent, a 3 column budget showing the 1 or 2 percent reduced rate 
rent, the HUD contract rental rate, and FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 note rate rent is needed.
    3. When HUD contract rate exceeds the FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 note rate. In a 100 percent Section 8 project 
without interest credit and where the HUD contract rental rate exceeds 
the note rate rent, the budget should show 2 columns reflecting each 
rent rate. The difference between the two rent rates is considered 
excess funds and is to be deposited in the reserve account.
    4. When part of units are covered by Section 8 HAP contract. In a 
project where only part of the units are under a Section 8 HAP contract, 
a 3 column budget of basic rental rate, HUD contact rental rate, and 
note rate rent is needed. The HUD contract rental rate may fall between 
the basic and note rate, or it may be higher than the note rate rent.
    D. Overage payments and excess income from an interest credit 
agreement:
    1. Overage is the amount by which total rental payments paid or to 
be paid by the tenants or members exceed the total basic monthly rental 
rate. In 100 percent Section 8/515 projects, and Plan II projects, where 
the HUD contract rental rate exceeds the approved 1 or 2 percent (or 
greater percentage in the case of Plan II) reduced rental rate, the FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approved rate is the 
required ``basic'' monthly rental rate. Whenever FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 approves a note rate rent change for a 
lesser amount than the change permitted by HUD, the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official must 
require the borrower to deposit any excess funds into the reserve 
account.
    2. Any Section 8 subsidy funds paid by HUD are paid on behalf of the 
tenant or member, and therefore, any Section 8 payments are not 
considered as excess funds until after any benefits provided by the 
interest credit agreement are recovered. Therefore, the following 
applies:
    a. Projects on an Interest Credit plan coded 7 or 8 on Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7. See figure 1 of 
paragraph VIID 2 a (3) of this exhibit.
    (1) When HUD rate is equal to or less than FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 note rate. In 100 percent Section 8/515 
projects when the HUD contract rental rate is more than the 1 or 2 
percent reduced rate and is either equal to or less than the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 note rate rent, overage will 
be paid to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in an 
amount equal to the difference between the HUD contract rental rate and 
the 1 or 2 percent reduced rate.
    (2) When HUD rate is greater than FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 note rate. In 100 percent Section 8/515 projects when 
the HUD contract rental rate is greater than the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 note rate rent, overage will be paid to 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 as in D 1 of this 
paragraph, and the amount equal to the difference between the HUD 
contract rental rate and the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 note rate rent will be deposited in the reserve account as 
excess income. In 100 percent Section 8/515 projects, when the HUD 
contract rental rate exceeds the note rate rent the borrower/manager 
needs to use FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Form 
1944-29, part I, items 23 through 29, to document the required deposit 
in the reserve account.
    (3) Figure 1. Projects with 100 percent of units assisted by HUD 
Section 8.

                                Example 1
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC05SE91.004


    Note: If the HUD contract rent and FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1 or 2 percent reduced rent are the same, then 
the first budget column would not apply.

                                Example 2

    b  Projects on Interest Credit Plan II and receiving Section 8 
Assistance. See figure 2 of paragraph VII D 2 b (3) of this exhibit.
    (1) Calculating overage. In Section 8/515 projects the overage will 
be the difference between basic rental rate and the note rate rent 
including the income from HUD. The overage will be reported as type 3.
    (2) Depositing excess income in the reserve account. In the cases 
where the HUD contract rental rate exceeds the note rate rent, the 
difference is excess income and will be deposited in the reserve 
account. The borrower/manager should use FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 Form 1944-29, part I, item 23 through 29, to 
document the required deposit in the reserve account.
    (3) Figure 2. Projects with some HUD Section 8/515 units.

    VIII  Rental or Occupancy Charge Control Preemption Policy. In order 
to carry out the provisions of this subpart and to protect a housing 
source in rural areas for very low-, low- and moderate income families; 
the financial obligation of borrowers; and the financial interest of the 
government in such housing, the entire field of rental or occupancy 
charge control that may be exercised by any local rental control board 
or other authority pursuant to State and local law, as it affects 
housing covered by this subpart, is hereby preempted.
    IX  Special Servicing Market Rate Rent (SMR) Change: When a Plan II 
or Plan II RA RRH project is experiencing serve vacancies due to poor 
local market conditions, an SMR change may be implemented to attract and 
keep tenants who could pay more than basic rent as part of a workout 
plan according to the provisions of exhibit F of subpart B of part 1965 
of this chapter. An SMR addresses

[[Page 306]]

the situation where some existing and prospective tenants are not 
willing to pay 30 percent of adjusted income or note rate rent because 
the rental rates would exceed those of other rental properties in the 
community. This action may only be taken after supervisory efforts by 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and management 
efforts by the borrower have not produced an acceptable level of 
occupancy. For the purposes of this paragraph, market area and community 
are used as defined in paragraph I of exhibit A-8 of subpart E of part 
1944 of this chapter.
    A  Eligibility for SMR. Based on borrower documentation and FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 servicing records, the 
Servicing Official will prepare a written recommendation for borrower 
eligibility for an SMR.
    1  Based on borrower documentation and Servicing Office 
verification:
    a  Over the most recent 6-month period, the monthly vacancy rate has 
averaged at least 15 percent or the project shows financial losses 
considering the following:
    (1) Each month was at least 12 percent vacant, and
    (2) When RA is not available, units subsidized by funds of the 
project/owner will be considered vacant for SMR calculations, or
    (3) The project submits financial records that show a 15 percent 
loss of rents available below basic rent not including project provided 
subsidies, and provided
    (4) The loss of rents available is not a result of management's 
failure to effectively market the units.
    b  Comparable market rental rates in the community are lower than 
the previously approved FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 note rate rents. Exhibit A-2 of subpart E of part 1944 of this 
chapter can be used to document comparable market rents.
    c  The borrower has aggressively marketed the project including the 
following actions:
    (1) Significant outreach efforts in the community, including (but 
not limited to) contacts listed in the Affirmative Fair Housing 
Marketing Plan.
    (2) The borrower had obtained approval from FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 for a servicing workout plan, exclusive 
of SMR features, at least 3 months earlier.
    d  The borrower complies with FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 regulations and encourages occupancy through good 
maintenance and positive relations with tenants.
    e  The borrower has provided a signed statement agreeing to forego, 
without provision to recoup, the return on initial investment while 
operating with an SMR.
    f  The borrower has submitted a project budget on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7, ``Multiple Family 
Housing Project Budget,'' with only minimally sufficient operation and 
maintenance expenses. The project budget should continue to fund other 
cash expenditures such as FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 payments and the reserve account, except for the return on 
initial investment which the borrower has agreed to forego according to 
paragraph IX A 1 e of this exhibit.
    2  Based on Servicing Office servicing actions and documentation:
    a  The project has been operational for at least 24 months. The 
National Office may make exceptions to this requirement on a case-by-
case basis for extreme hardship.
    b  No more than 10 percent of budgeted expenses are reflected in 
unrestricted cash on hand, and reserve account balances do not exceed 
the required accumulation-to-date minus authorized withdrawals.
    c  The Servicing Official has reviewed and discussed with the 
borrower the feasibility of using borrower contributed funds, including 
advances, in accordance with paragraph XII C of exhibit B of this 
subpart.
    d  The Servicing Official has reviewed and approved a project budget 
with only minimally sufficient operation and maintenance expenses and 
other expenses as specified in paragraph IX A 1 f of this exhibit.
    e  The Servicing Official has reviewed any market studies or surveys 
received from MFH loan applicants for the market area and considered any 
information that may conflict with the request for an SMR.
    B  Approval of SMR.
    1  The State Director may approve the use of an SMR when the 
conditions listed in paragraph IX A of this exhibit are met.
    2  While a request for an SMR is pending or an SMR is in effect, 
requests to develop new FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 units in the area will be handled in accordance with 
Sec. 1944.213(f) of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter.
    C  Implementing an SMR.
    1  After the use of an SMR has been approved by the State Director, 
the Servicing Official will establish an SMR for the project with the 
borrower.
    a  The SMR will be obtained by adjusting the ``FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 Debt Payment'' item in the ``Proposed 
Budget'' column of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1930-7, to reflect a payment to FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 amortized at an interest rate which is less 
than the full note rate on the borrower's promissory note. The interest 
rate chosen may never be less than 2 percent.
    b  The interest rate of the SMR budget will be set at a level that 
will make project

[[Page 307]]

SMR rental rates comparable with community rental rates. This rate will 
remain constant except as provided in paragraph 4 D of this exhibit.
    2  The initial change to SMR rents or a decrease in SMR rents will 
be accomplished in accordance with the following:
    a  The borrower will submit to the Servicing Official, the items 
listed in paragraph IV A 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 of this exhibit.
    b  The Servicing Official shall review the budget and supporting 
documentation, and when found to be acceptable, notify the borrower in 
writing that the budget is approved. A copy of the approved budget will 
be forwarded to the State Director.
    c  In addition to any State requirements, the borrower notifies each 
tenant or member of the new rates and/or utility allowance and:
    (1) Include in the notice an explanation of the changes and events 
which necessitated the change. Also, the explanation must specify any 
adverse and/or positive effect the change may have on the tenants or 
members.
    (2) Mail a copy of the notice to the tenant or member at least 30 
days prior to the effective date of the change.
    (3) Offer the tenants or members an opportunity to meet with 
management to discuss the change and review any material contributing to 
the change.
    (4) Inform the tenants or members of their right to request a review 
of the rate change approval decision within 45 days of the date of the 
notice by writing to the next higher FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 approval official. Until the request is resolved, the 
tenants or members are required to pay the changed amount of rent as 
indicated in the notice of approval.
    3  When an SMR is implemented in a Plan II section 8/515 Project, 
use lines 23 through 29 of Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-29 to report any additional payments to the 
reserve account required when HUD contract rents exceed SMR rental 
rates.
    D  Changing an SMR.
    1  An SMR may be increased or decreased whenever the local market 
conditions warrant, but must be reviewed at least annually.
    a  If the local market conditions that caused the need for the SMR 
have not been resolved and corrected, document same and update the 
monitoring timeframes and proceed no further. However,
    b  If the local market conditions have changed and change in the SMR 
is warranted, the requirements listed in paragraphs IX D 2, 3, and 4 of 
this exhibit apply.
    2  An SMR must have the SMR rate rent increased by a minimum of 10 
percent per year (or a higher amount if mutually agreed to by the 
borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354) when 
the:

                  Exhibit D to Subpart C--Energy Audit

    I  Objective: It is the objective of the Farmers Home Administration 
(FmHA) or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 that Multiple 
Family Housing (MFH) financed by the Agency incorporates energy 
conservation measures and operating practices in keeping with the 
National Energy Strategy for a more efficient, less vulnerable, and 
environmentally sustainable energy future. Monitoring of this objective 
will be accomplished by energy audit.
    II  Purpose and Intended Outcome:
    A  The purpose of this exhibit is to define the FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 requirements for energy 
audits. While energy audits will review the functioning of energy 
conservation measures initially incorporated in the housing, or 
previously retrofitted, and identify need for any further measures, the 
main thrust of energy audits will be to evaluate and/or recommend 
operating practices used in individual dwelling units and the common 
areas of a project.
    B  The intended outcome is to reduce tenant or member utility 
expenses; reduce project operating and maintenance expense; reduce usage 
of subsidy; improve the marketability of units and value of the 
property; conserve national energy resources within cost effectiveness; 
and increase the comfort and enjoyment level of tenants or members.
    III  Borrower Responsibility:
    A  Initial audit. An initial energy audit is required for each 
project during the third year of operation following completion of 
construction for ``early'' detection and correction of any deficiencies 
in energy conservation measures and/or operating practices.
    B  Subsequent audit. A subsequent energy audit is required at least 
within 5 years of the initial audit and at 5-year intervals thereafter, 
to identify if energy conservation improvements are needed.
    C  Submission of audit. The borrower shall submit a copy of the 
initial or subsequent energy audit along with the next submission of 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7, 
``Multiple Family Housing Project Budget.'' The borrower's plan for 
implementing the recommended improvements shall be included in the 
project budget. The submitted copy of the energy audit will be retained 
in the file by the Servicing Office for review during subsequent annual 
reviews. If any of the improvements are deferred due to cost 
ineffectiveness, the borrower shall, each year thereafter, include with 
the annual project budget, an updated cost feasibility analysis of the 
deferred improvements, along with the borrower's recommendation for 
implementing the improvements.

[[Page 310]]

    D  Cost of audit. An energy audit is beneficial to the operation of 
an MFH project. The cost of the audit is an operational expense. The 
cost should be consistent with the size of the project and comparable to 
the cost of other audits in the area. The cost may be paid from annual 
revenue or from the reserve account depending on the amount.
    IV  Performance of Energy Audit:
    A  An energy audit shall be an in-depth, on-site inspection of the 
building shell and of the space heating, space cooling, ventilation, and 
water heating equipment for the building. It shall be conducted by a 
qualified energy auditor.
    B  Persons shall be considered qualified to perform an energy audit 
if they:
    1  Are authorized under a State Plan approved by the Department of 
Energy (DOE) in accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 456,
    2  Are authorized under a Federal Standby Plan promulgated by DOE in 
accordance with the requirements in 10 CFR part 456, or,
    3  Can otherwise demonstrate that they possess the technical skills 
and knowledge necessary to perform energy audits.
    C  When persons meeting the qualifications in paragraph IV B of this 
exhibit are not available, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 State Director, with prior National Office approval, may 
institute a plan and method to accomplish the requirements of this 
exhibit using Agency staff and resources, provided it is cost and time 
effective to perform such task.
    D  The energy auditor shall inspect the building to determine which 
energy saving measures and operating practices should be improved. The 
energy auditor is expected to summarize the results of this inspection 
and projected cost savings in priority order and include them in a 
written report.
    1  The report shall address the condition or application of the 
following energy saving measures:
    a  Caulking and weatherstripping;
    b  Central high efficiency air conditioners;
    c  Ceiling, wall, and floor insulation;
    d  Crawlspace or foundation wall insulation;
    e  Duct or pipe insulation;
    f  Water heater insulation;
    g  Storm or thermal windows and doors;
    h  Heat-reflective window and door material;
    i  Crawlspace and/or attic ventilation;
    j  Energy management devices;
    k  Clock thermostats;
    l  Furnace efficiency modifications; and
    m  Vent dampers for water heaters, furnaces, and boilers.
    2  The report may address the following energy saving measures if 
significant benefits can be shown in the opinion of the energy auditor:
    a  Solar domestic hot water systems;
    b  Active solar space heating system;
    c  Combined active solar space heater and solar domestic hot water 
systems; and
    d  Passive solar space heating and cooling systems.
    3  The auditor shall inspect the building and report any improvement 
of energy conserving operating practices that can lead to immediate 
energy savings. These practices include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
    a  Furnace efficiency maintenance and adjustments (air filters 
should be changed frequently);
    b  Water flow reduction on showers and faucets;
    c  Sealing leaks and check insulation of pipes and ducts;
    d  Raising thermostat settings in summer and lowering them in 
winter;
    e  Cleaning baseboard convectors and refrigerator coils;
    f  Nightime temperature setback;
    g  Reducing energy use when apartment is unoccupied;
    h  Plugging leaks in attics, basements, and fireplaces;
    i  Efficient use of shading; and
    j  Reduce water heater temperature setting (should not exceed 120 
degrees Fahrenheit).
    4  The report shall include a list of any recommended energy saving 
measures and/or operating practices. The following information shall be 
provided as applicable:
    a  Description;
    b  Estimated useful life;
    c  Estimated annual energy cost savings in the first year;
    d  Cost; and
    e  Estimate of any incremental annual operation and maintenance 
costs.
    5  The report shall include a summary of the energy auditor's 
qualifications.
    V  Funding: Improvements may be funded from annual project income, 
project reserve, a subsequent loan, borrower's funds, or any other FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 authorized funding 
which will keep the improvement cost effective. Plans for funding the 
improvements should be included in the borrower's recommendation for 
implementation.
    VI  Servicing Official Responsibility:
    A  The Servicing Official shall determine the cost effectiveness and 
financial impact of the proposed improvements from information contained 
in the energy audit.
    1  Cost effectiveness. Cost effectiveness shall be determined by 
comparing the value-in-use of the facility with and without the proposed 
energy saving improvement. Exhibit D of FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 1922-B, (available in any FmHA or 
its successor

[[Page 311]]

agency under Public Law 103-354 office), describes the ``value-in-use'' 
approach that may be used to appraise cost effectiveness.
    2  Financial impact. Financial impact shall be determined by 
comparing the estimated net energy and operation and maintenance costs 
savings in the first year to the annual cost of amortizing a loan to 
install the proposed energy saving improvement. A positive financial 
impact occurs when the first year annual savings equals or exceeds the 
annual cost of amortizing any loan(s) for the proposed energy savings 
improvement. Exhibit D-1 of this subpart may be used to organize the 
calculation of the financial impact.
    3  When the identified and/or deferred improvements determined by an 
energy audit obtained within the immediate past 5-year period are found 
to be cost effective and have a positive financial impact, the Servicing 
Official shall recommend or require that any rent or occupancy charge 
increase approval requested by the borrower be conditioned upon 
installation of such energy saving improvement(s).
    4  The Servicing Official may recommend a rent or occupancy charge 
increase for energy saving improvements which are not ``cost effective'' 
whenever the borrower contributes sufficient funds to reduce the cost of 
the improvement so that, on the basis of the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 investment only, the improvement is cost 
effective. A positive first year financial impact is not required. Any 
contribution made by the borrower to reduce the cost of the improvement 
to the cost effective limits will not be an eligible contribution for 
computing return on investments. The project reserve may not be utilized 
for such contribution.
    B  When the improvements are not cost effective or do not have a 
positive financial impact, and the borrower does not elect to reduce the 
cost of the energy saving measures as described in paragraph VI A 4 of 
this exhibit, the Servicing Official shall recommend deferral of 
implementation of the improvements. Any deferred improvements must be 
analyzed during each subsequent year's annual analysis.
    C  A copy of the decision regarding the energy audit will be 
included in the annual reports forwarded to the State Director.
    VII  State Director Responsibility: The State Director shall review 
the Servicing Official's recommendations and the decision regarding 
implementation of the proposed improvements and/or practices as a part 
of the annual report review.
    VIII  Development: All development will be performed in accordance 
with the requirements of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter and 
subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter, except that Sec. 1924.6 
(b)(3)(i) of subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter will not apply to 
improvements made by the owner-builder method.
    IX  Rent or Occupancy Charge Change: Any rental or occupancy charge 
change necessitated by the improvements must be processed as set forth 
in exhibit C of this subpart.

            Exhibit E to Subpart C--Rental Assistance Program

    I  General. The objective of the rental assistance (RA) program is 
to reduce rents paid

[[Page 312]]

by low-income households. This exhibit sets forth the policies and 
procedures and delegates authority under which RA will be extended to 
eligible tenants occupying eligible Rural Rental Housing (RRH) and 
eligible members occupying Rural Cooperative Housing (RCH) projects 
financed by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354. For the purposes of this exhibit, the 
term ``tenant'' also means ``member.'' This exhibit also applies to Farm 
Labor Housing (LH) projects when the borrower is a broadly-based 
nonprofit organization, nonprofit organization of farmworkers, or a 
State or local public agency. RA will supplement the benefits available 
to tenants under the interest credit program outlined in exhibit H to 
this subpart.
    II  Definitions.
    A  Eligible tenants. Any very low-income, or low-income household 
meeting the following requirements:
    1  The household adjusted annual income must not exceed the very 
low- or low-income limit established for the area as indicated in

FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Office).
    2  The household must be unable to pay the approved rental rate plus 
utility allowance within a portion of their income not exceeding the 
highest of:
    a  30 percent of their adjusted monthly income;
    b  10 percent of gross monthly income; or
    c  If the household is receiving payments for public assistance from 
a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically 
designated by that agency to meet the household's shelter cost.
    3  The household must meet the occupancy policy established for the 
project and approved by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 according to paragraph VI D 2 of exhibit B of this subpart.
    4  The household must have an unexpired and signed Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8, ``Tenant 
Certification,'' on file with the borrower.
    B  Eligible project.
    1  All projects must operate under Interest Credit Plan II RA to be 
eligible to receive RA, except LH loans, direct RRH, and insured RRH 
loans approved prior to August 1, 1968, which must operate under Plan 
RA. To be eligible for RA the project must have a:
    a  RRH insured or direct loan made to a broadly-based nonprofit 
organization, or State or local agency, including Senior Citizen 
Housing;
    b  RRH insured loan to an individual or organization who has or will 
execute a loan resolution or loan agreement agreeing to operate the 
housing on a limited profit basis as defined in Sec. 1944.205 of subpart 
E to part 1944 of this chapter;
    c  RCH insured or direct loan; or
    d  LH loan, or an LH loan and grant combination, made to a broadly-
based nonprofit organization or nonprofit organization of farmworkers or 
a State or local public agency.
    2  Borrowers may utilize the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program and FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 RA in the same project. 
In such cases, Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1944-7, ``Multiple Family Housing Interest Credit and Rental 
Assistance Agreement,'' for the project will reflect coding for ``Plan 
II RA.''
    3  Borrowers will provide RA to only those eligible tenants 
occupying LH, RCH, or RRH rental housing units financed by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    C  Operational project. A completed RRH, RCH, or LH project financed 
by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 which has been 
opened for occupancy and has at least been partially occupied by 
tenants.
    D  New projects. Newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated 
RRH, RCH, or LH project financed by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354. For new construction RA purposes, if further means 
before any units are occupied.
    E  Rental assistance. RA, as used in this exhibit, is the portion of 
the approved shelter cost paid by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 to compensate for the difference between the approved 
shelter cost and the monthly tenant contribution as calculated according 
to paragraph IV A 2 c of exhibit B to this subpart. When the household's 
monthly gross tenant contribution is less than the approved utility 
allowance which is billed directly to and paid by the tenant, the owner 
will pay the household that difference according to paragraph IX A 2 of 
this exhibit.
    F  RA agreement. The term refers to Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-27, or its predecessor. Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 444-27 and Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 444-27A.
    G  RA obligation. The obligation consisting of the number of RA 
units and associated dollar amounts of rental assistance specified in a 
particular RA agreement.
    H  RA obligation number. The identification number associated with a 
particular RA obligation.
    I  Replacement units. RA units which replace RA units in RA 
agreements expiring because obligated funds have been fully disbursed.

[[Page 313]]

    J  Servicing units. RA units which increase the number of RA units 
resulting in initial or additional RA agreements.
    K  Shelter cost. The approved shelter cost consists of basic or note 
rate rent plus utility allowance when used. Basic or note rate rent must 
be shown on the project budget for the year and approved according to 
Sec. 1930.122(b)(1). Utility allowances, when required, are determined 
and approved according to part 1944, subpart E, exhibit A-6, of this 
chapter. Any changes in rental rates or utility allowances must be 
processed according to exhibit C of this subpart.
    L  Utility allowances. The allowance approved by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 according to exhibit A-6 of 
subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter to cover the cost of utilities 
which are payable directly by the households.
    III  Utilization of RA. All borrowers with eligible projects as 
defined in paragraph II B of this exhibit are encouraged to utilize the 
RA program and receive RA payments on behalf of eligible tenants. 
Generally, the borrower, or the borrower's approved management agent, 
will initiate the processing of a RA application.
    IV  Priority of RA applications.
    A  State of allocations. The National Office may establish a State 
quota on the number of RA units that may be approved and obligated in 
any fiscal year. The State Director will limit the approval of RA to no 
more than the number of units allocated to the State. Unless otherwise 
stated by the National Office, the State allocation will indicate the 
number of RA units for operational projects and the number of RA units 
to be used for new construction.
    B  Allocation to projects within a State. The State Director will 
distribute any RA units allocated to the State according to any specific 
guidance established by the National Office. When no specific guidance 
is established by the National Office the State Director will approve 
requests for RA to projects according to the provisions of this exhibit. 
Priority in allocating RA units will be as follows:
    1  Replacement units: The State Director will distribute or reserve 
RA units and give priority to projects needing replacement units before 
any initial or additional units are allocated to other new or 
operational projects. The State Director should ascertain how many RA 
units are expected to expire in each Servicing Office during the current 
fiscal year and the first quarter of the following fiscal year.
    2  New housing: Any RA units allocated to the State for new 
construction will be distributed on a priority basis in the following 
order:
    a  Applications for RRH and RCH loans where the market survey 
information indicates that a large percentage of the prospective tenants 
needed RA. When the number of RA units available is inadequate to cover 
all such applications, the units will be distributed giving priority to 
those projects having highest need located in areas identified as having 
the greatest need for low-income housing, and selected for funding in 
accordance with Sec. 1944.231 of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter.
    b  For LH projects, RA units will be allocated by the National 
Office from the National Office reserve on a case-by-case basis at the 
time the projects are considered for funding at the National Office 
level.
    3  Operational housing: When the National Office provides an 
allocation for servicing RA units, the State Director will distribute 
them to operational RRH, RCH, and LH projects based on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-25, ``Request for Rental 
Assistance,'' that have been submitted by eligible borrowers. Priority 
will be given to projects based on this exhibit and administrative 
directives issued by the National Office under the annual RA allocations 
or other authorizations or guidelines established through the budget 
process. The National Office will notify the State Director each year of 
any specific date by which all requests for RA must be submitted to FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for consideration.
    V  Processing of RA applications. All requests for RA will be 
processed according to this paragraph and may be approved by the State 
Director.
    A  Operational projects.
    1  A borrower with an eligible project in which there are tenants 
paying in excess of 30 percent of their adjusted income for rent should 
be encouraged to have on file a Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-25 with the Servicing Official to avoid delays 
in processing future servicing requests. Once a Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-25 is on file at the FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Office, 
subsequent submittals of the form will not be necessary to support 
subsequent approvals of RA by FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354. A separate Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-25 will be submitted for each project. The borrower 
should include the following with each request.
    a  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-
29, ``Project Worksheet for Interest Credit and Rental Assistance,'' 
with all columns completed for each tenant in the project. (All Forms 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 must be 
current.)
    b  Approved or proposed budget for the year on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7, ``Multiple

[[Page 314]]

Family Housing Project Budget,'' with exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 
1944 of this chapter attached, when applicable.
    2  Prior to the full disbursement of obligated funds on any 
agreement, a borrower or approved management agent may submit a request 
for replacement RA units. The request should contain all the material 
requested in paragraph V A 1 of this exhibit and should be submitted no 
later than 3 months prior to the expected full disbursement of obligated 
funds, to allow time for processing the request. The number of 
replacement units may not exceed the number of units that are expiring. 
Once replacement units have been requested, additional units may not be 
requested until Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1944-51, ``Multiple Family Housing Obligation-Fund Analysis,'' is 
received obligating the replacement units. Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-51 requesting the additional units 
must be coded sequentially as required in paragraph V C 5 of this 
exhibit.
    3  The Servicing Official will review the budget, exhibit A-6 of 
subpart E of part 1994 of this chapter, Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29, and Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-25 submitted by the borrower to 
assure that the items are complete and accurate. The Servicing Official 
will complete Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-25 and submit all data provided by the borrower to the State 
Director with appropriate comments and recommendations.
    B  Projects to be funded.
    1  Applicants requesting funding for new projects who are planning 
to utilize the RA program, should submit a completed Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-25 to the Servicing 
Official when submitting a preapplication or application for funding.
    2  The number of units of RA requested should be based on the market 
data for the area, the proposed rental rates as reflected in a budget 
for the project, and the income levels of the prospective tenants.
    C  State Director action on requests for RA. Only the State Director 
or delegated members of the State Office staff may approve or disapprove 
RA requests.
    1  Approval actions. When the State Director determines that RA can 
be obligated or transferred, part III of Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-51 for obligation, or Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55, ``Multiple Family 
Housing Transfer of Rental Assistance,'' for transfers, will be prepared 
and distributed according to the Forms Manual Insert (FMI). Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-27, ``Rental 
Assistance Agreement,'' will not be executed or amended until the 
obligation or transfer is verified by the Finance Office. The State 
Office will verify the obligation or transfer via the computer terminal 
on the day following the request.
    2  Completing RA agreements. When the State Director verifies that 
RA units have been obligated or transferred by the Finance Office, the 
State Director will forward a copy of either Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-51 or Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55 to the Servicing Official. The 
Servicing Official will complete Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-27, and attach the appropriate copies of Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-51 or Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55 according 
to the FMI.
    a  Initial RA agreements. The Servicing Official will prepare the 
original and two copies of Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-27. When the project does not have a Form FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 in effect, the 
Servicing Official will prepare an original and three copies. The 
Servicing Official and the borrower will then execute the originals and 
all copies of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-27 and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-7. The forms will be distributed according to their FMIs.
    b  Replacement or modified RA agreements. When a Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 444-27 initiated prior to May 
1, 1985, is replaced or modified, a new Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-27 will be prepared and distributed 
according to the FMI. For every replacement or modification on or after 
May 1, 1985, the original and all copies of the affected RA agreement 
will be noted, assembled and distributed by the Servicing Official 
according to the FMI.
    3  Modification of an existing RA agreement. After any request for a 
change in the amount of RA has been obligated, a copy of Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-51 or Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55 will be attached 
to Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-27 
and distributed according to the FMI. A new FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 is not required.
    4  Denial of RA Request.
    a  If RA funds are available but cannot be provided due to a 
determination of ineligibility, the State Director will inform the 
borrower, in writing, of the reasons. The borrower will be given appeal 
rights in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter in such 
cases. When RA funds are not

[[Page 315]]

available from the State's allocation or the National Office Reserve the 
decision will be considered nonappealable, however, the decision is 
still reviewable, under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.
    b  Should RA not be available for lack of appropriation to replace 
an expiring RA obligation, the State Director will advise the borrower 
to notify tenants of the increase to their contribution to rent 
following the notification requirements of exhibit C of this subpart. 
Tenants who cannot afford the increased rent shall be given the 
opportunity to quit the lease and vacate the project without penalty.
    5  RA obligation numbers.
    a  Each RA obligation will be assigned a six digit RA obligation 
number by the Approving Official as follows:
    (1) First two digits--Fiscal year (FY) in which the funds were 
obligated (i.e., 85, 86, etc).
    (2) Second two digits--Numbers in sequential order for each fiscal 
year starting with 01 (i.e. 93-01, 93-02, 94-01, 94-02).
    (3) Third two digits--All obligations will be coded 00.
    b  RA obligation obligated before FY 1985 will be coded as follows:
    (1) First two digits--FY initial obligation was made on the project 
(i.e., 78, 79, 80, etc.)
    (2) Second two digits--Relate to the pre-Automated Multi-housing 
Accounting System conversion loan number to which the RA obligation was 
processed.
    (3) Third two digits--Indicate the number of modifications plus 1. 
(Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-27 with 
two modifications on September 30, 1984, will be designated ``03.'')
    c  The Finance Office will track RA obligations and undisbursed 
balances by number.
    VI  Terms of the RA Agreement.
    A  Effective date. Each Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-27 will be effective the first day of the month 
in which it is executed. If assistance is granted to a project under an 
appeal according to paragraph XVI of this exhibit, the effective date 
will be retroactive to the first day of the month in which the 
assistance was denied, provided the borrower agrees to make any 
appropriate refunds to tenants who would have been entitled to RA during 
the retroactive period.
    B  Term.
    1  Twenty-year RA agreement. Twenty-year agreements were authorized 
during the initial years of the RA program through FY 1982. Twenty-year 
agreements were restricted to new projects or modifications of existing 
20-year agreements. The agreement is effective for 20-years from the 
effective date of the agreement. This agreement may be modified or 
terminated in accordance with the terms of the RA agreement. The 
agreement will expire when the funds obligated for the RA units 
described in section 1 of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-27 are fully disbursed. This can be any time before or 
after the end of the 20-year term. Upon expiration of the agreement, a 
replacement agreement may be executed. If a replacement agreement is 
considered, it will be for a 5-year period.
    2  Five-year RA agreement. Five-year agreements may be used for 
operational projects, or for new projects when 20-year units are not 
available. The agreement shall be effective for 5 years from the 
effective date of the agreement. This 5-year agreement may be modified 
or terminated in accordance with the terms stated on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-27.
    The agreement will expire when the funds obligated for the RA units 
described in section 1 of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-27 are fully disbursed. This can be any time before or 
after the end of the 5-year period.
    3  Modification of RA agreements. Forms FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-27 may be modified:
    a  To add or subtract RA units assigned to the project through 
obligation, through transfer from another RA obligation, or as an 
incentive to avert prepayment.
    b  To reinstate a suspended RA obligation(s) to a new borrower in 
the same project after a voluntary conveyance or a foreclosure and a 
credit sale within the Multiple Family Housing (MFH) program; or
    c  To transfer a suspended RA obligation(s) to a new borrower and a 
different project after liquidation of the project assets or after the 
loan is paid in full.
    4  Amendment of RA agreements.
    a  Any existing RA obligation executed prior to February 15, 1983, 
which will have a remaining obligation balance at the end of the 5-year 
or 20-year expiration date stated in section 9, ``Term of the 
Agreement,'' may be modified by the use of Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 444-27A, ``Amendment to Rental 
Assistance Agreement.'' The amended agreement will expire when the 
obligated funds are fully disbursed.
    b  Any existing RA agreement on earlier Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 444-27 or exhibit D-2 (of now obsolete 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 444.5) 
containing an occupancy standard may be amended by mutual consent of the 
borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 when 
a new occupancy policy for the project is approved according to 
paragraph VI D 2 of exhibit B of this subpart. To amend the form:
    (1) Delete section 5 of the original and the borrower's copy and 
have the deletion dated

[[Page 316]]

and initialed by the appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 official and the person(s) authorized to sign for the 
borrower.
    (2) Type the following statement on the reverse of the original 
agreement and the borrower's copy and have the statement dated and 
initialed by the appropriate FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 official and the person(s) authorized to sign for the 
borrower. ``Amended (date) ______ by authority of paragraphs VI B 4 of 
exhibit E and VI D 2 a of exhibit B of subpart C of part 1930, chapter 
XVIII, title 7, Code of Federal Regulations.''
    5  Replacement RA obligations. Replacement RA obligation(s) for 
either 5-year or 20-year obligations will be for a 5-year period. All 
requirements in paragraphs VI B 2 and 3 of this exhibit apply. Expiring 
RA obligations and replacement RA obligations may run concurrently for a 
period of 30-50 days so any undisbursed obligation balance on the 
expiring RA agreement can be liquidated.
    VII  Recordkeeping Responsibilities.
    A  The Finance Office (FO) will track the use of RA obligation and 
ensure that RA obligation is not disbursed or credited to a borrower's 
account in excess of the RA obligation. Quarterly and annually, the FO 
will provide the Servicing Official with an RA payment and obligation 
status report for each project. The annual version of this report will 
be filed in position 2 of the project case file and maintained 
indefinitely.
    B  The Servicing Official will notify the borrower to apply for 
replacement RA obligation when the RA undisbursed balance reaches a 
level sufficient to cover approximately 6 months of RA requests. This 
figure will be based on the project's average monthly request for RA.
    VIII  Responsibilities of Borrower in Administering the RA Program.
    The borrower and management agent for each project receiving RA 
should fully understand the responsibilities and requirements of 
carrying out the program. The following guidelines will be followed:
    A  RA payments will not be made directly to eligible tenants 
receiving RA except as specified in paragraph IX A of this exhibit. The 
borrower will maintain an accurate accounting of each tenant's utility 
allowance and payments made to tenants. All other RA payments will be 
recorded as a credit to the tenant's monthly rental payment.
    B  The borrower must submit Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-8 for each tenant as required in paragraph VII F 
of exhibit B of this subpart.
    C  The incomes reported by the tenants must be verified by the 
borrower in accordance with paragraph VII of exhibit B of this subpart.
    D  Borrowers utilizing RA must comply with Sec. 1930.122(b)(1) of 
this subpart. RA will not be approved for a project until the operating 
budget has been approved by the FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 State Office or the Servicing Official. Servicing 
Officials, with assistance from the State Office, must closely supervise 
and assist borrowers in complying with all accounting and management 
requirements.
    E  A borrower participating in the RA program must have an FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 approved lease with the 
assisted household. All leases must comply with the provisions of 
paragraph VIII of exhibit B of this subpart.
    F  The borrower will be responsible to FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 for any errors made in the administration of 
the RA program which are made by the borrower or the borrower's 
authorized management agent. Errors in computation or other unauthorized 
use of RA will require, at a minimum, the repayment of any incorrectly 
advanced RA funds. If the error or unauthorized use of RA appears to be 
deliberate or intentional, the State Director will refer the case to the 
Office of Inspector General according to FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 Instruction 2012-B (available in any FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    IX  Handling Utility Allowances.
    A  Payment of utilities.
    1  When the tenant is billed directly for utilities, rent paid by 
the tenant receiving RA will be the difference between the established 
utility allowance and the portion of income cited in paragraphs II A 2 
a, b, or c of this exhibit.
    2  When utilities are paid by the household receiving RA and the 
portion of income cited in paragraphs II A 2 a, b, or c of this exhibit 
is less than the allowance for utilities, the borrower will pay the 
household the difference between the utility allowance and one of those 
limits of the household's adjusted monthly income.
    3  In a project where the owner pays all utilities, the tenant rent 
will be the portion of income cited in paragraphs A 2 a, b, or c of this 
exhibit up to the approved rent for the rental unit being occupied.
    B  Determining the allowance. The utility allowance will be 
determined and recorded by the use of exhibit A-6 of subpart E of part 
1944 of this chapter.
    C  Changes in allowances. The utility allowance should be reviewed 
annually and adjusted if there are substantial changes in utility and 
public service rates. Allowances will be adjusted on an annual basis if 
necessary when the owner submits a new budget for approval. Changes in 
utility allowance which will result in changed rent paid by tenants will 
be processed according to exhibit C of this subpart.

[[Page 317]]

                 X  Method of Payment of RA to Borrower

    A  Regular monthly RA payments.
    1  Borrower responsibilities.
    a  Any RA due the borrower will be deducted from the balance of 
scheduled loan payments, any delinquent payments, and other charges due 
on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29 
and the remaining balance must be submitted to the Servicing Office by 
check. If the RA due the borrower exceeds the balance of scheduled loan 
payments, delinquent payments and other charges, no additional payment 
is due from the borrower and an RA check for the excess will be issued 
by the FO.
    b  Each month the borrower must forward to the Servicing Official a 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29. Any 
new Forms FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 
must be submitted to the Servicing Office as required in exhibit B of 
this subpart. Both forms must be prepared for each project according to 
the instruction attached to the respective forms.
    2  Servicing Official responsibilities.
    a  When new Forms FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1944-8 are received, the Servicing Official will immediately date 
stamp each form with the receival date, review each Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-8 and verify that the 
information contained on the form is complete and correctly computed 
based on information contained in the form.
    b  When a Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-29 is received, the Servicing Official will:
    (1) Date stamp each form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-29, and review the form and assure that entries are 
supported by the current form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-8.
    (2) Enter the payment data via field office terminals as required in 
exhibit A to subpart K of part 1951 of this chapter (available in any 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office).
    c  The Servicing Official should verify the accuracy of the 
borrower's servicing address shown on the FO record. When the address 
shown is incorrect, corrections must be made on AMAS screen M5A ``Record 
Borrower/Project Data'' via a field computer terminal.
    B  When a project account is delinquent, the Servicing Official may 
agree to release a portion of the monthly RA for project operation 
according to provisions authorized in a servicing plan developed in 
accordance with exhibit F of subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
Office).
    C  An RA payment request must be based on actual occupancy as of the 
first day of the month.

                       XI  Assigning RA to tenants

    A  New project. Applications for occupancy should be accepted during 
the construction phase of the project, after the preconstruction 
conference has been held, and placed on a waiting list. During initial 
rent-up period, the following priorities will apply:
    1  Until all the RA units have been assigned, a number of apartment 
units in the project equal to the number of RA units will be initially 
reserved for eligible tenants as defined in paragraph II A of this 
exhibit who qualify for RA, even if there are applications on other 
lists that applied earlier. Applications qualifying for RA will be 
considered according to the priority established by paragraph XI B of 
this exhibit, by passing those applicants on the waiting list whose 
income is above the low-income limits for the area. The remaining units 
equal to the number of units that will not be subsidized with RA can be 
rented simultaneously to other applicants.
    2  If a substantial number of apartment units reserved to be used 
with RA units remain vacant after initial rent-up and the borrower could 
rent those units to applicants not eligible for RA, the borrower may 
request a transfer of unused RA units in accordance with paragraph XV B 
5 of this exhibit. However, applicants not eligible for RA cannot be 
selected to occupy units initially reserved to be used with RA until the 
unused RA units are transferred.
    3  If there are still vacant units, those applicants by-passed 
because they did not qualify for RA will be considered for occupancy on 
a first-come, first-served basis.
    B  Operational RRH and RCH projects. To determine priority for 
assigning an available RA unit in an operational project, the latest 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29 for 
the project must be updated as of the date the unit is available, 
assuring that columns 3 through 9 of part II are current and accurate.
    1  First priority for assigning RA must always be given to eligible 
very low-income households in the following order:
    a  Eligible very low-income tenants paying the highest percentage of 
adjusted annual income for approved shelter costs.
    b  Eligible very low-income applicants from the project waiting list 
according to the order provided in paragraph VI H of exhibit B of this 
subpart. No eligible tenant household in the project may be required to 
move from the project to allow an applicant on the waiting list who is 
eligible for RA to move in.

[[Page 318]]

    2  Second priority for assigning RA will be given to eligible 
households with low-income in the following order.
    a  Eligible low-income tenants in the project paying the higher 
percentage of adjusted annual income for approved shelter cost.
    b  Eligible low-income applicants from the project waiting list. 
Low-income applicants will be selected according to paragraph VI H of 
exhibit B of this subpart, provided the borrower has satisfied the 
requirements of paragraph XI C of this exhibit.
    3  Third priority for RA will be given to occupancy ineligible 
tenants as described in paragraph VI D 7 b of exhibit B of this subpart 
living in the project.
    4  Eligible tenants receiving the benefits of RA may continue 
receiving such benefits as long as they remain eligible for RA, as the 
RA calculation formula shows a moderate income tenant that was initially 
eligible for RA as a very low- and/or low-income tenant who still needs 
RA and there is an RA agreement in effect.
    C  Limits on low-income RRH and RCH applicants who may receive 
occupancy and RA:
    1  When no more very low-income applicants are on the waiting list 
and RA is available, eligible low-income applicants may obtain occupancy 
and receive RA provided that:
    a  For projects available for initial occupancy prior to November 
30, 1983, no more when 25 percent of the vacant units receiving RA may 
become occupied by low-income tenants other than very low-income 
tenants.
    b  For projects available for initial occupancy on or after November 
30, 1983, no more than 5 percent of the vacant units receiving RA may 
become occupied by low-income tenants other than very low-income 
tenants.
    2  The borrower may rent units and provide RA to other than very 
low-income applicants/tenants in excess of the percentage in paragraph 
XI C 1 a and b of this exhibit respectively, only when there are no more 
very low-income applicants or tenants available in the market area. The 
borrower must have documentation in its file and available to FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for its review to show the 
efforts made, and the facts used to determine that there are currently 
no more very low-income applicants in the market area.
    D  Operational LH projects: Tenants who meet the definitional 
requirements of domestic farm laborers found at Sec. 1944.153 of subpart 
D of part 1944 of this chapter shall be assigned RA in the following 
priority order within the subcategories of priority occupancy 
established by that subpart:
    1  Very low-income.
    2  Low-income.
    E  Assigning RA other than the first of the month:
    1  When a tenant receiving RA vacates before the end of the month, 
the RA unit should be immediately reassigned to another tenant or an 
applicant using the priorities given in paragraph XI B of this exhibit.
    2  When RA is assigned to an applicant and the applicant initially 
enters the project on a day other than the first of the month, the 
applicant's tenant contribution for housing costs will be prorated for 
the remaining portion of the month the same as if the tenant was 
receiving RA. [Example: Basic rent of $200 and the tenants monthly 
contribution with RA would be $120, the prorate amount for \1/2\ month 
would be $60.]
    3  When RA is assigned to a tenant other than the first of the 
month, no adjustment to their tenant contribution on Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-29 for that month will be 
made. The borrower will begin to receive reimbursement of RA for the 
tenant as of the first day of the next month.
    4  No adjustment will be made on Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-29 to request additional RA payment or to 
refund any excess RA payment or overage for the previous month when RA 
is reassigned other than the first of the month.
    XII  RA assigned to wrong household: When the tenant has correctly 
reported income and household size, but RA was assigned to a household 
in error, that tenant's RA benefit should be canceled and reassigned. 
Incidents involving incorrect reporting are addressed in subpart N of 
part 1951 of this chapter.
    A  Before the borrower notifies the tenant, the borrower or 
management agent shall review the case with the Servicing Official. If 
the Servicing Official verifies that an error has been made based on 
information available at the time the unit was assigned, the tenant will 
be given 30 days written notice that the unit was assigned in error and 
that the RA benefit will be canceled effective on the next monthly 
rental payment due date after the end of the 30-day notice period. The 
tenant will also be notified in writing that:
    1  The tenant has the right to cancel the lease based on the error 
made by the borrower and the loss of benefit to the tenant.
    2  The RA granted in error will not be recaptured from the tenant.
    3  The tenant may meet with management to discuss the cancellation 
and the facts on which the decision was based. If the facts are accurate 
and the tenant cannot produce further evidence proving eligibility for 
RA, there will be no appeal from the decision. If the tenant feels there 
is justification for further review, the borrower must give the tenant 
appeal rights under subpart L of part 1944 of this chapter.
    B  Reassigning RA. The RA unit will be reassigned to the next 
eligible household,

[[Page 319]]

based on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-29 from which the original priority was established, when the unit 
was erroneously assigned. The RA will not be retroactive unless the 
reassignment was based on an appeal by the tenant. Retroactive RA may 
not exceed the project's remaining RA obligation balance.
    XIII  RA payment cancellation: When an RA check must be canceled, 
the following procedure will be followed:
    A  Return of the original RA U.S. Treasury Check: The Servicing 
Office will prepare Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 1944-53, ``Multiply Family Housing Cancellation of U.S. Treasury 
Check and/or Obligation'' as specified in the FMI and mail it to the MFH 
unit in the FO.
    B  Return of all or a portion of the monthly RA payment or refund of 
RA previously advanced: A check from the borrower made payable to FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will be submitted to 
the MFH unit in the FO on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-53, completed according to the FMI.
    XIV  Terminating existing RA agreements obligated in prior and/or 
current FYs.
    A  When a project's obligated funds are fully disbursed under any 
given RA obligation number, RA will be automatically terminated by the 
FO and no further RA requests will process against the RA obligation 
number. The Servicing Official must monitor these balances through field 
office terminals and AMAS Report No. 513-C. The Servicing Office will 
modify Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-
27 according to the FMI to indicate that a termination has occurred. The 
Servicing Official will notify the borrower in writing that the 
obligation under the RA obligation number has expired and the RA 
obligation number must be stricken from the agreement.
    1  For all RA obligations before FY 1985. RA is considered fully 
disbursed by the FO when all RA funds obligated before FY 1985 are 
disbursed.
    2  For all RA obligations after FY 1984. RA is considered fully 
disbursed by the FO when all RA funds obligated in a particular FY are 
disbursed. This includes RA transferred from a different MFH project.
    3  When a Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-27 consists of several different obligations (Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-51, part III, or Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55) 
identified by different RA obligation numbers, and the obligations will 
not be fully disbursed at the same time, only those RA obligation 
numbers with fully disbursed obligation will be terminated.
    B  Prior to full disbursement of obligated funds:
    1  Prior FY obligations. Prior FY obligations will not be 
terminated. They will be suspended by the State Director using 
procedures in paragraph XV of this exhibit.
    2  Current FY obligations. The State Director is authorized to 
terminate RA obligation prior to the disbursement of obligated funds if 
the funds were obligated during the current FY. The undisbursed funds 
for the RA obligation will be returned to the current FY obligation 
authority.
    XV  Suspending or transferring existing RA.
    A  RA may be suspended or transferred according to the requirements 
for each situation described in paragraph XV B of this exhibit and the 
following:
    1  Suspension.
    a  The State Director may approve a suspension of a project's RA 
agreement and obligation as a result of the servicing actions described 
in paragraphs XV B 2, 3, and 4 of this exhibit. The State Director will 
maintain records and control of the suspended RA.
    b  The State Director or Servicing Office will notify the borrower 
in writing, stating the reason(s) the RA is suspended.
    c  The Servicing Office will put a suspend code on the account. This 
is done on the M5A ``Record Borrower/Project Data'' screen in AMAS using 
Suspend Code 7. After suspension, only RA payments described in 
paragraph XV B 4 of this exhibit will be processed by the Servicing 
Office.
    d  The State Director may approve reinstatement of the RA to the 
same borrower in the same project. After approval, the Servicing Office 
will remove the suspend code from the project using the M5A screen.
    e  The State Director may reinstate the RA to the same borrower in 
the same project by removing the suspend code from the M5A screen 
through field office terminals.
    2  Transfer.
    a  Only the State Director may approve an RA transfer.
    b  RA may be transferred to any borrower with an RA eligible project 
according to the priorities established by this exhibit or the National 
Office.
    c  AMAS will determine the per unit value of the RA obligation being 
transferred by dividing the undisbursed balance of the RA obligation on 
the date the transfer is processed by the number of RA units in the 
agreement. The number of units being transferred times the per unit 
value equals the total amount transferred. After the transfer processes 
the State Director should enter the dollar amount of the transfer in the 
Remarks area of Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1944-55.
    d  RA units identified by different RA obligation numbers may be 
transferred. New RA obligation numbers should be assigned

[[Page 320]]

according to the FMI for Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-55.
    e  All or any portion of the units in an RA Agreement with an 
undisbursed balance may be transferred by the State Director.
    f  When the State Director approves an RA transfer, Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55 completed according to 
the FMI, will be used to notify the FO except as noted in paragraph XV B 
1 of this exhibit.
    g  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-
27, with Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-55 attached, will be completed according to the FMI for each 
transferee. The transferee may use the transferred units effective the 
first day of the month in which the transfer is approved.
    h  The transferor's Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 1944-27 will be modified by attaching a copy of Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55 according to the 
FMI to indicate that a portion of the agreement has been transferred. 
When all the RA units on a RA agreement have been transferred, the 
transferor's present agreement will be so documented.
    B  RA may be suspended and/or transferred in the following 
situations according to the following directions:
    1  RA transfer accompanying a project transfer. When a project is 
transferred to an eligible borrower, the transferee may assume the 
transferor's liquidated RA obligation(s). Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55 will be forwarded to the FO 
attached to Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1965-10, ``Information on Assumption of Multiple Family Housing Loans,'' 
as required in Sec. 1965.65(c)(11) of subpart B of part 1965 of this 
chapter.
    2  Suspension and transfer after a voluntary conveyance or 
foreclosure sale. When a project with RA is voluntarily conveyed to the 
Government or acquired by foreclosure sale, the RA obligation will be 
automatically suspended under the borrower's name when the FO processes 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1965-19, 
``Multiple Family Housing Advice of Mortgaged Real Estate Acquired.'' 
These units will be held in suspense until the final disposition of the 
acquired property has been determined. During the inventory period 
tenants will pay 30 percent of their income for rent. Tenants entitled 
to reimbursement for utilities will be paid from project income.
    3  Suspension and transfer after a liquidation or prepayment.
    a  When a project with RA is liquidated through sale outside of the 
program or the loan is paid in full, the RA will be suspended and, 
subsequently, transferred to a different FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 financed project in accordance with paragraph 
XV B 3 b of this exhibit, if applicable, or if not, to another project 
at the State Director's discretion.
    b  When a tenant receiving RA is, or will be, displaced from an FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 project due to 
prepayment or liquidation, the RA the tenant was receiving will be 
transferred, or suspended and transferred, to any other FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 project, regardless of 
location, to which the displaced tenant moves. That tenant will be given 
first priority for a unit of RA, regardless of other priorities for the 
RA, if all the following conditions are met:
    (1) The borrower is eligible to receive and administer RA.
    (2) The tenant is eligible to occupy the project and to receive RA.
    (3) The tenant had taken all the following steps to insure 
eligibility to receive priority for the unit of RA:
    (i) Had been placed on at least one waiting list for a FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 project with a Letter of 
Priority Entitlement.
    (ii) Moved to the project as soon as the name was reached on a 
waiting list, even if it meant temporarily occupying an ineligible unit. 
The ineligiible unit may not differ from the one for which the tenant is 
eligible by more than one bedroom.
    (iii) Moved to an eligible unit as soon as one was available.
    (4) The RA has not previously been transferred for the tenant's 
current displacement.
    c  Procedures for transferring RA and modifying RA agreements 
outlined in paragraphs V C and XV A 2 of this exhibit will be followed, 
but the receiving project borrower need not submit Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-25 if the RA was received 
as a result of the occupancy of a displaced tenant.
    4  Suspension and transfer or reinstatement due to a servicing 
action.
    a  When servicing a project's account according to Sec. 1965.85 of 
subpart B of part 1965 of this chapter and the account has been 
accelerated:
    (1) The RA will be suspended to the extent that no payments will be 
credited to the project's account. Interest credit will be credited to 
the project's account until the appeal period for the acceleration has 
expired. After the expiration of the appeal period, if it is determined 
that foreclosure will proceed, the interest credit will be cancelled as 
of the last day of the month in which the appeal period expired. RA will 
be automatically suspended by the interest credit cancellation.

[[Page 321]]

    (2) That portion of the monthly RA not needed to pay the project 
monthly installment and other charges as specified in paragraph VIII of 
exhibit A to subpart K of part 1951 of this chapter (available in any 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 office) may be 
processed and returned to the project operating account to maintain 
project operation.
    (3) RA agreements expiring during the acceleration and appeal 
process may be renewed in order to continue payment of RA as described 
in paragraph X V B 4 a (2) of this exhibit.
    b  After final disposition of the acceleration, expiration of the 
appeal and redemption period of the defaulting borrower the RA will be:
    (1) Transferred with a credit sale. If the project is sold through a 
credit sale to an eligible borrower within the program, the suspended RA 
should be transferred from the previous borrower's case number and 
project number to the new case number and project number. Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-55 will be attached 
to Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1965-20 
``Multiple Family Housing Advice of Mortgaged Real Estate Sold,'' when 
it is sent to the FO, or
    (2) Transferred to a different project when the defaulting project 
is sold outside the program. When the suspended RA is not needed for the 
project after the credit sale or other disposition of the acquired 
property, the State Director should transfer the RA to a different 
project or projects as provided in paragraph XV A 2 of this exhibit, or
    (3) Reinstated to the same project when the defaults are corrected 
and the State Director reinstates the borrower's account.
    c  The borrower will be apprised of the appeal rights available 
under subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter upon notification of the 
pending suspension. The suspension will not be effective until these 
appeal rights have been exhausted.
    5  Transfer of unused RA. When RA is unused after initial rent-up 
and not needed because of a lack of eligible potential tenants in the 
area, all or a portion of it may be transferred when the State Director 
determines that the following conditions have been met:
    a  The borrower describes the efforts made to market the subsidized 
units and further demonstrates that:
    (1) The market survey indicated there should be a significant need 
for rental housing by households in the market area that would have 
required RA for occupancy, but all or a substantial portion of the RA 
units available remain unused after a 2-year period since initial 
availability. The borrower must:
    (i) Document the efforts made to market the project to RA eligible 
applicants;
    (ii) Demonstrate that the waiting list does not contain RA eligible 
applicants and the project is not occupied by RA eligible tenants who do 
not receive RA; and
    (iii) Certify that project management has not used a policy of 
discouraging RA eligible households from applying for or obtaining 
tenancy in the project.
    (2) Rent increases anticipated for the following 2 years will not 
prompt a request for RA according to the provision of exhibit C of this 
subpart.
    b  The Servicing Official recommends the RA transfer after reviewing 
documentation submitted by the borrower and finding that the applicable 
conditions of paragraph XV B 5 of this exhibit have been met.
    c  If, after the end of the initial year of a RA agreement, the 
borrower has not used a portion of the RA units for any ensuing 
consecutive 12-month period, the State Director may transfer the number 
of unused units, minus at least one, to another project without the 
borrower's request. If the remaining unit(s) remains unused after an 
additional 12-month period, the State Director may authorize its 
transfer to another project. This would apply only if the current 
agreement is on form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1944-27 and when:
    (1) The borrower has made the efforts described in paragraphs XV B 
5a (1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this exhibit to market the project to 
tenants needing RA, or if the borrower's failure to use RA has resulted 
in an acceleration of the loan account.
    (2) The Servicing Official has reviewed the project occupancy list, 
waiting list, past RA usage, and any other data available and verified 
that there is no apparent RA needs in the project.
    (3) The State Director has notified the borrower at least 30 days in 
advance of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's 
intent to transfer the RA units and has given the borrower appropriate 
appeal rights in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.
    (4) If the borrower appeals the decision, the appeal is resolved in 
accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter before any 
transfer action is taken.
    (5) The transfer will be completed in accordance with paragraph XV A 
2 of this exhibit.
    6  Transfer due to an unclosable loan. When RA will be unused 
because the loan to which it was obligated will not be closed, or the RA 
agreement is not signed, the RA obligation may not be transferred except 
as provided under the conditions of Sec. 1944.235 (b) of subpart E of 
part 1944 of this chapter. However, if this situation occurs during the 
same FY of obligation, the obligation should be cancelled and 
reobligated immediately using

[[Page 322]]

current authorities. Obligations from prior FY must be canceled and will 
be lost unless the conditions of Sec. 1944.235 (b) of subpart E of part 
1944 of this chapter exist.
    XVI  Rights for appeal if RA is not granted or is cancelled by FmHA 
or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    A  Borrowers who have requested RA in writing and are denied such 
assistance due to a determination of ineligibility by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354, or when RA is cancelled, will 
be notified in writing of the specific reasons why they have been denied 
RA and will be notified of their appeal rights in accordance with 
subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.
    B  If at any time a borrower or a household is granted RA under an 
appeal, the borrower or household will receive the next available RA 
unit.
    C  Borrower denial of RA to tenants will be handled according to 
subpart L of part 1944 of this chapter.
    XVII  Forms and exhibits. Exhibit A-6 to subpart E of part 1944 of 
this chapter and Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1944-7 are to be used in determining the amount of RA to be 
provided.

  Exhibit F to Subpart C--Farmers Home Administration or Its Successor 
  Agency Under Public Law 103-354 Multiple Family Housing Supervisory 
                       Visit--Pre-Visit Worksheet

                    Purpose and Use of This Document

    Use this document to help organize information and plan for a 
supervisory visit, compliance review, and physical inspection. It should 
be completed far enough in advance so that all relevant concerns and 
issues surrounding project operations are known and considered prior to 
the site visit.
    Appropriate Servicing Office staff should examine the project 
casefile, consult with coworkers, and review any outstanding issues 
raised by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354's most 
recent annual review of project operational and financial status. Other 
relevant issues may be obtained from a variety of sources such as 
ongoing tenant certification or payment processing concerns, Automated 
Multi-housing Accounting System (AMAS) status, correspondence from 
tenants or project management, or other issues contained in the running 
record.
    Use your available tracking systems, AMAS, FOCUS, or Multi-housing 
Tenant File System (MTFS) to gather statistical information relevant to 
this document and the visit, to help define current project status and 
to determine if that status falls within acceptable FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 norms for occupancy or 
financial operations.
    Thoroughly review the management plan and management agreement to 
assure that the management practices at the project are in accordance 
with FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 procedure and 
with the way project management has agreed to operate.
    You should use the random sampling technique contained in exhibit F-
1 of this subpart to establish a sample of tenants for conducting tenant 
file reviews, interviews and apartment unit reviews, or wage matching. 
You may use an alternative sampling technique; however, you must fully 
explain any alternative sampling techniques on this document. Also, you 
may supplement your random sample with additional tenants that appear to 
represent unique occupancy or verification situations.
    You may contact tenants to advise them of your visit and provide 
them the opportunity to express their view of project operations. 
Exhibit F-2 of this subpart may be used for this purpose.

(Insert Servicing Office Address)

    Some of the issues FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law

or certified; and if occupancy charges are at FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 approved levels.
    Your response to this letter is completely voluntary. We appreciate 
your assistance.

      Sincerely,

Exhibit H to Subpart C--Interest Credits on Insured Rural Rental Housing 
                   and Rural Cooperative Housing Loans

    I  Purpose: This exhibit outlines the policies and conditions under 
which interest credits will be made on insured Rural Rental Housing 
(RRH) and Rural Cooperative Housing (RCH) loans.
    II  Definitions: As used in this exhibit:
    A  Interest credit is the amount of assistance the Farmers Home 
Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
may give a borrower toward making its payments on an insured RRH or RCH 
loan.
    B  Interest credit and rental assistance (RA) agreement is an 
agreement between FmHA or

[[Page 330]]

its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the borrower providing 
for interest credits and/or RA for RRH or RCH loans. This agreement will 
be on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7, 
``Multiple Family Housing Interest Credit and Rental Assistance 
Agreement.''
    C  Project is the total number of rental or cooperative housing 
units that are operated under one management plan with one loan 
agreement/resolution.
    D  Basic rent is determined on the basis of operating the project 
with payments of principal and interest on a loan to be repaid over a 
30-year or longer period at 1 percent per annum and covering budgeted 
project expenses. Basic rent also means basic occupancy charge.
    E  Note rate rental is a unit rental charge determined on the basis 
of operating the project with payments of principal and interest which 
the borrower is obligated to pay under the terms of the promissory note 
and meet budgeted project expenses. Note rate rental also means note 
rate occupancy charge in an RCH housing project.
    F  Overage is the amount by which total rental or occupancy charge 
payments paid or to be paid by the tenants or members of a project 
exceed the total basic monthly charge.
    G  Surcharge is 25 percent of the established rent in a Plan I 
project which is added to the rent of an ineligible tenant or member.
    III  Eligibilty: Borrowers may receive interest credit provided the 
loan was made on or after August 1, 1986, to a nonprofit corporation, 
consumer cooperative, State or local public agency, or to any individual 
or organization operating on a limited profit basis; is repaid over a 
period of 30 years or more; and meets the other requirements of this 
exhibit subject to the following limitations:
    A  Plan I will be only to broadly-based nonprofit corporations and 
consumer cooperatives. Except for subsequent loans to projects approved 
before August 1, 1968, Plan I interest credit is no longer available. 
All borrowers already operating on Plan I may continue operating under 
it according to the applicable requirements of this exhibit and of this 
subpart. A subsequent loan on a Plan I project approved after August 1, 
1968, will require the project to convert to Plan II.
    B  Plan II will be available to broadly-based nonprofit 
corporations, cooperatives, State or local public agencies, or to profit 
organizations and individuals operating on a limited profit basis.
    C  Units must be ready for occupancy (decent, safe, and sanitary) to 
qualify for interest credit.
    IV  Options of Borrowers: An eligible borrower operating under Plan 
I or Plan II, as described below, will determine interest credits on its 
loan in the respective manner indicated.
    A  Plan I.
    1  Borrowers operating under this plan must agree to limit occupancy 
of the housing to very low-or low-income nonelderly and very low-, low- 
and moderate-income elderly, disabled, or handicapped persons.
    2  A borrower under Plan I generally must:
    a  Determine that there is firm market and continuing demand for 
rental housing by persons within the applicable income limits.
    b  Prepare a budget on the basis of a 3 percent loan.
    c  Determine rentals to be charged.
    d  Determine adjusted personal income of each tenant or member and 
have each tenant or member complete Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-8, ``Tenant Certification.'' Determine the 
monthly rent or occupancy charge to be paid by each tenant or member 
household.
    B  Plan II.
    1  Borrowers operating under this plan must agree to limit occupancy 
of the housing to households, including elderly, disabled, and 
handicapped persons of very-low, low- and moderate-incomes. Under Plan 
II, interest credits are based on the cost of operating the project and 
the size and income of the household.
    2  A borrower under Plan II generally must:
    a  Prepare one budget form that reflects two rent levels; the first 
level on the basis of a 1 percent interest rate loan to determine basic 
rental; the second level on the basis of a loan at the interest rate 
shown in the promissory note to determine note rate rental.
    b  Determine both basic rental and note rate rental for the 
different units based on the two budgets. (See exhibit H-1 of this 
subpart).
    c  Determine adjusted personal income of each tenant or member and 
have each tenant or member complete Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-8. Determine the monthly rent or occupancy 
charge to be paid by each tenant or member household.
    d  Determine the required monthly payment on the loan at 1 percent 
interest plus overage for the month for the total units. The amount of 
the project payment will be entered on Form FmHA or its successor agency 
under Public Law 103-354 1944-29, ``Project Worksheet for Interest 
Credit and Rental Assistance.''
    V  Determining the Amount of Payment:
    A  For Plan I. The amount of payment will be determined by using the 
amortization factor for a payment at a 3 percent interest rate (use the 
same number of years that was used for computing the regular installment 
on the note) plus all surcharges.

[[Page 331]]

    B  For Plan II. The amount of payment will be determined by using 
the amortization factor for a payment at a 1 percent interest rate (use 
the same number of years that was used for computing the regular 
installment on the note) plus all overage.
    C  For the project. The payment amount for all loans on the project 
will be added together to determine the project payment. The amount due 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will also include 
all overage, surcharges, late fees, audit receivables, and cost item 
charges.
    VI  Special Conditions:
    A  Leases or occupancy agreements. Borrowers participating in the 
interest credit program must have an FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 approved lease or occupancy agreement with the 
assisted household. Leases and occupancy agreements must comply with the 
requirements of paragraph VIII of exhibit B of this subpart.
    B  Rental surcharges to ineligible tenants. If a unit is rented in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph VI A of this exhibit to a 
tenant who is ineligible because the income exceeds the maximum income 
limits, the ineligible tenant will:
    1  Under Plan I, be charged a 25 percent rental surcharge. To 
illustrate, if the unit normally rents for $100 per month, this 
ineligible tenant would pay $125 per month. The 25 percent surcharge, or 
$25 in this illustration, would be paid on the account and would be 
included with, but in addition to, the regular payment on the loan.
    2  Under Plan II, be charged the note rate rental.
    C  Vacancies.
    1  When all construction is not completed but some units are ready 
for occupancy and the contractor consents in writing to permit 
occupancy, the State Director may authorize the occupancy of those 
completed units to eligible tenants or members at the rent or occupancy 
charge they would be paying as if the amortization effective date (AED) 
and subsidy levels had been established. A prerent-up or preoccupancy 
conference is required before marketing and rent-up begins. All income 
generated must be deposited in the general operating account and used 
for management and operation of the units except for member's patronage 
capital contributions.
    2  Multi-Family Housing units rendered unusable due to fire, natural 
cause, or other damage requiring less than 180 days to repair or replace 
shall be assumed to be rented or occupied at the monthly basic rate 
rental or occupancy charge rate. If the units are not repaired or 
replaced within the 180 day period, they shall thereafter be assumed to 
be unmarketable and the units will be carried at the monthly note rate 
rental or occupancy charge rate (i.e., full overage for such units will 
be paid by the borrower until the units are again ready for occupancy). 
The Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 
will be cancelled, effective the first day of the month following the 
180-day period.
    3  The State Director may make an exception to the 180-day period if 
all of the following conditions are met:
    a  The repairs have not been started or completed due to 
circumstances beyond the borrower's control; and
    b  The borrower must be able to show that they have acted in good 
faith and they face serious financial difficulties in maintaining the 
project for existing tenants and they are unable to meet the payments on 
the indebtedness without the subsidy.
    4  Any borrower directly or indirectly affected by action under this 
subpart will be granted the appropriate appeal rights according to 
subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.
    5  RRH or RCH units vacant for lack of tenant or member applications 
on the waiting list or for repair not associated with paragraph VI C 2 
of this exhibit shall be assumed to be charged at the basic rent.
    D  Interest credit for tenants in projects under the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Housing Assistance Payment Program 
or FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 rental 
assistance. When any rental units in an RRH project are leased under the 
new construction Section 8 program, Form HUD 50059, ``Certification and 
Recertification of Tenant Eligibility,'' or other acceptable HUD Form 
will be completed. When any rental units in an RRH project are leased 
under the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 RA 
program, Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-8 will be completed.
    E  Special cases. Situations not covered by this exhibit or exhibit 
E to this subpart will be handled individually with instructions from 
the National Office.
    F  Understanding eligibility. The borrower should understand the 
eligibility requirements for occupancy of the housing. Instructions for 
tenant or member eligibility are in paragraph VI D of exhibit B of this 
subpart.
    VII  Execution of Agreements:
    A  Interest credit and rental assistance agreement.
    1  Multiple advance loans. Interest credit may become effective the 
first day of the month following substantial completion of construction 
when the project is ready for full operation, which is the AED. When the 
Servicing Official determines that the project is ready for full 
operation, the borrower and the Servicing Official should execute Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7. A separate 
Form FmHA or its successor agency under

[[Page 332]]

Public Law 103-354 1944-7 will be executed for each loan on the project.
    2  Interim financing and servicing. Effective dates for interim 
financed loans and servicing action will be according to the Form Manual 
Insert (FMI) for Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-
354 1944-7.
    B  Change in interest credit plan. A borrower under Plan I may 
change, if it can meet the requirements of the other plan, by executing 
a new Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7.
    C  Borrowers who are not receiving interest credit. If an eligible 
borrower did not execute a Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-7 according to paragraph VII A of this exhibit, 
interest credit may be instituted at any time during the life of the 
loan provided the borrower agrees to the requirements of Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 and this exhibit. 
When Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 
is executed, it will be effective for the first of the month in which 
the Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 is 
executed.
    D  Borrowers who have had interest credit terminated.
    1  If an interest credit agreement on Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 has been terminated because the 
benefits were not needed and circumstances change to where an interest 
credit is again needed, a new Form FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354 1944-7 may be executed.
    2  If an interest credit agreement on Form FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 has been terminated because of 
the borrower's failure to comply with requirements and the appropriate 
corrective actions have been accomplished, a new Form FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-7 may be executed.
    VIII  Tenant or Member Certification: Tenant or member certification 
and recertification for interest credit borrowers will be performed in 
accordance with paragraph VII of exhibit B to this subpart.
    IX  Project Payments: With each payment made, the borrower will 
complete Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-29. The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
representative handling the transmittal to the Finance Office will 
transmit the payments according to subpart B of part 1951 of this 
chapter and exhibit A of subpart K of part 1951 of this chapter 
(available in any FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
office).
    A  Plan I.
    1  The borrower will make monthly payments in an amount necessary to 
repay the project loans as if the loans carried a 3 percent interest 
rate. When a rental surcharge is collected as described in paragraph VI 
B of this exhibit, the surcharge will be included and will be credited 
as interest to the account as a regular payment. The special handling of 
payments involving rental surcharges is explained in paragraph IX A 2 of 
this exhibit.
    2  When a payment is made for any month that involves a rental 
surcharge, Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
1944-29 will be completed with the amount of the surcharge being 
inserted in the spaces provided. This form will be completed and the 
amount shown and will be charged to the project account regardless of 
whether the surcharge is actually collected by the borrower.
    B  Plan II. The borrower will make monthly payments as though the 
project notes were written at a 1 percent interest rate plus any overage 
due and payable whether or not collected from the tenant or member.
    X  Servicing: Handling of interest credits when servicing a 
project's accounts according to Sec. 1965.85 of subpart B of part 1965 
of this chapter will be handled according to the applicable parts of 
subpart A of part 1955 of this chapter. Any unusual cases that cannot be 
serviced in accordance with these sections should be submitted to the 
National Office with the State Director's recommendations.

 Exhibit I to Subpart C--Rural Rental Housing Loans and the Housing and 
   Urban Development Section 8 Rental Certificate and Rental Voucher 
                        Programs (Existing Units)

    I  General. This exhibit contains the policies and procedures that 
will be followed by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 to permit the utilization of 
existing Section 515 Rural Rental Housing (RRH) units and the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) tenant-based Section 8 Rental 
Certificate and Rental Voucher Programs.
    II  Applicability. This exhibit is not applicable to units in 
Section 515/8 projects which use the project-based Section 8 new 
construction and substantial rehabilitation programs. Otherwise, FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 RRH borrowers are 
authorized to utilize the procedure outlined in this exhibit and the HUD 
Section 8 Rental Certificate Program or the Rental Voucher Program for 
existing housing as outlined in HUD's regulations 24 CFR part 882 and 24 
CFR part 887 (as amended) respectively. To promote the use of these 
programs with existing projects, the following action should be taken:
    A  Servicing Officials should inform RRH borrowers operating in the 
area of their jurisdiction of the contents of this exhibit.
    B  The HUD Section 8 program could benefit any eligible tenant in an 
RRH project who is paying more than 30 percent of its income for rent 
and utilities. Therefore, RRH borrowers should advise tenants who are 
paying more than 30 percent of their adjusted income for housing of the 
possibility of obtaining Section 8 housing assistance payments. Those 
tenants paying 50 percent or more of their adjusted income for housing 
have preference over those paying less. In the Rental Certificate 
Program, families generally pay 30 percent of their monthly adjusted 
income toward the rent and the total rent to the owner must be below a 
maximum amount. Section 8 Rental Certificate and Rental Voucher 
assistance is administered by local Public Housing Agencies (PHA) 
authorized by HUD to administer the program in the area. This Section 8 
assistance can be used in the unit of the family's choice anywhere in 
the State where the issuing PHA is located, and in certain areas in 
adjacent States. Families must apply to the PHA and come to the top of 
its waiting list through normal PHA selection preferences.
    C  The HUD Rental Voucher Program uses a ``shopper's incentive.'' If 
a unit rents for less than the payment standard established by the local 
PHA, the eligible family benefits by paying less than 30 percent of its 
monthly adjusted income toward rent and utilities, subject to a minimum 
rent calculation by the PHA. If a unit rents for more than the payment 
standard for the area (not the actual rent), the housing assistance 
payment is not increased, nor is the family told it must find another 
unit, as in the Rental Certificate Program. Instead, the family pays the 
entire difference between the rent and the rental voucher payment 
standard. The family may rent the unit if it is willing to pay more than 
30 percent of its income toward rent. There is no maximum rent as in the 
Rental Certificate Program.
    D  In Rural Cooperative Housing (RCH), cooperatives are considered 
rental housing in the Section 8 Rental Certificate and Rental Voucher 
programs. Wherever the word tenant appears in this exhibit, it shall 
also mean member; rent shall also mean occupancy charge; and lease shall 
also mean occupancy agreement.
    III FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 Policies 
Concerning Rental Rates and Payments.
    A  Under the Section 8 Rental Certificate and Rental Voucher 
Programs, the PHA will pay a portion of the tenant's rent including 
utility allowance as described in paragraphs II B or C of this exhibit, 
whichever is appropriate. The contract rent to be established under 
either HUD program will be as follows:
    1  For borrowers with a 3 percent direct RRH loan and borrowers 
operating in accordance with interest credit Plan I, the contract rent 
will be the note rate rental rate for the units as determined by the 
current approved annual budget using a 3 percent amortization factor for 
principal and interest payments;
    2  For borrowers operating without interest credit, the contract 
rent will be the note rate rental rate for the unit as determined by the 
current approved annual budget using the amortization factor for the 
note rate of interest for principal and interest payments;
    3  For borrowers operating in accordance with interest credit Plan 
II, the contract rent:
    a  For Rental Certificate participants will be the basic rental rate 
as determined by the current approved annual budget using a 1

[[Page 334]]

percent interest amortization factor for principal and interest 
payments;
    b  For Rental Voucher participants, the rent to owner must be the 
lesser of the note rate rent for the unit as approved by FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 OR the payment standard 
approved by the PHA (but not less than basic rent approved by FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354).
    (1) When basic rent is less than the PHA approved payment standard, 
the borrower will collect and remit the difference between the basic 
rent and payment standard to FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 as overage to avoid double subsidy on behalf of the tenant.
    (2) Should the PHA inadvertently pay the owner (borrower) more than 
the amount specified in the housing assistance contract between the PHA 
and the owner, the owner shall return the overpayment to the PHA as an 
excess payment
    B  The method of calculation and transmittal of the scheduled 
payment to the Finance Office will be in accordance with paragraph IX of 
exhibit H of this subpart.

                          IV  Responsibilities.

    A  Family. A household family must apply to the PHA and be issued a 
Certificate of Family Participation or a Rental Voucher to obtain the 
appropriate housing assistance. Households receiving housing assistance 
under either program will be responsible for fulfilling all of their 
obligations under the Certificate of Family Participation or Rental 
Voucher issued to them by the PHA and under the lease with the owner. 
However, a lease violation is not necessarily a reason for terminating 
Section 8 assistance.
    B  Owner (FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 
borrower). Upon being presented a Certificate of Family Participation or 
a Rental Voucher by a family, an owner wishing to participate in the 
program shall sign a Request for Lease Approval (Form HUD 52517-A) which 
is then submitted to the PHA. After PHA approval the owner will execute 
a Housing Assistance Contract (Form HUD 52535-A) with the PHA and a 
lease with the tenant. Owners shall be responsible (and subject to 
review or audit by the PHA or HUD) for performing all of their 
obligations under the contract and lease.
    C  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    1  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, in 
accordance with existing regulations, will be responsible for normal 
loan servicing and supervision, including but not limited to:
    a  Obtaining and reviewing all reports from the borrower in 
accordance with paragraph XIII C of exhibit B of this subpart.
    b  Review and approval of budgets and rental rates.
    c  Collection of required payments and review of the borrower's 
establishment and maintenance of required accounts.
    2  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will not be 
responsible for the requirements and conditions of the contract entered 
into between the PHA and owner but will cooperate with HUD and the PHA 
to the extent possible to assure that the borrower carries out all 
obligations under the contract.

                         V  Special Conditions.

    A  Eligibility of family.
    1  The PHA will determine a household's eligibility before the 
Certificate of Family Participation or Rental Voucher is issued. To be 
eligible for either form of housing assistance, the household's income 
as determined by HUD generally may not exceed the very low-income limit, 
based on 50 percent of the median income for the area. The household's 
eligibility for housing assistance payments under the Rental Voucher 
program continues until the amount payable by the family equals or 
exceeds the payment standard or when the amount payable by the family 
equals or exceeds the rent to owner plus any applicable utility 
allowances. However, when these conditions are exceeded, the family may 
still be able to occupy a rental unit under the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 interest credit program if 30 percent of 
the family's adjusted gross income is greater than the lowest 
established rental rate for the unit. In both the Rental Certificate and 
Rental Voucher Programs, the housing assistance contract terminates when 
1 year has elapsed since the last Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) to 
the owner.
    2  Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1944-
8, ``Tenant Certification,'' will not be required for tenants who have 
obtained a Certificate of Family Participation or a Rental Voucher from 
the PHA. A copy of the Certificate of Family Participation or the Rental 
Voucher, however, needs to be provided to the FmHA or its successor 
agency under Public Law 103-354 Servicing Official.
    3  At admission, the tenant's adjusted household income must not 
exceed the maximum income limitations (initially in the case of RCH) as 
authorized by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 for 
the project.
    B  Security deposits. According to HUD regulations, the owner may 
require a household to pay a security deposit. For certificate 
participants the maximum amount will be the greater of the amount of one 
month's total tenant payment or $50. For voucher participants, the 
security deposit may not exceed the lesser of the limit established by 
the PHA or one month's rent to the owner. Under HUD regulations, if a 
certificate

[[Page 335]]

household vacates a unit and the security deposit is insufficient, the 
owner may claim reimbursement from the PHA in an amount not to exceed 
two month's contract rent. For voucher participants, the owner may claim 
up to one month's rent to owner for amounts owed under the lease. 
Neither program allows claims for reimbursement of unpaid rent for the 
period after the family moves from the unit.
    C  Payment for vacated units.
    1 Rental Certificate Program. If a certificate family vacates the 
unit in violation of the provisions of the lease, the owner may receive 
the full housing assistance payment for the month in which the family 
vacates and then in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for a 
vacancy period not exceeding an additional month or the expiration or 
other termination of the lease, whichever comes first.
    2  Rental Voucher Program. If the voucher family moves from the 
unit, the owner shall promptly notify the PHA. The PHA shall make no 
additional housing assistance payment to the owner for any month after 
the month in which the family moves out. However, the owner may retain 
the housing assistance payment for the month in which the family moves.
    D  Recertification for families with either a Section 8 Rental 
Certificate or Rental Voucher.
    1  The PHA, not the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354 borrower, must reexamine the income and family composition of 
all Rental Certificate and Rental Voucher families at least annually, 
and adjust the housing assistance payment made on behalf of the family 
to reflect any changes in the family's monthly adjusted income, size, or 
composition. Once a HAP contract expires, recertification responsibility 
reverts to the borrower and FmHA or its successor agency under Public 
Law 103-354 forms and income verification and certification requirements 
apply.
    2  All changes in family composition must be reported to the PHA.
    3  A family may request a redetermination of the housing assistance 
payment at any time, based on a change in the family's income, adjusted 
income, size, or composition.
    4  Whether reporting of increases of family income between annual 
recertifications is required is determined by the PHA. The PHA policy 
must be stated in its administrative plan.
    E  Rent changes.
    1  When project rents in all units change.
    a  Rental Certificate Program. Rents for tenants receiving rental 
certificate assistance under HUD Form 52535-A (Section 8 Existing 
Housing Assistance Payments Contract for Subsidized Units) may change 
after the beginning (day 1) of the HAP contract term for the initial 
leasing of the unit with Section 8 assistance. The amount of the 
contract rent adjusts automatically when the subsidized rent is changed. 
However, the adjustments are subject to rent reasonableness limitations 
which are determined by the PHA. Adjustments may not result in material 
differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable 
unassisted units as determined by the PHA.
    b  Rental Voucher Program. Rents for tenants receiving rental 
voucher assistance may not change until the end of the initial 12 months 
of the individual lease, even though all unit rents may have been 
changed in the meantime. The lease may provide that the owner may 
increase the tenant's rent any time AFTER the first anniversary of the 
lease, but the Owner must give the tenant and the PHA 60 days prior 
written notice of any increase before it takes place.
    2  When tenant household income, size, and composition change. The 
following items apply to both the Section 8 Rental Certificate and 
Rental Voucher Program.
    a  The PHA must examine the income and family composition of all 
rental certificate and rental voucher families at least annually and 
adjust the housing assistance payment made on behalf of the family to 
reflect any changes in the family's income, size, or composition.
    b  All changes in family composition must be reported to the PHA.
    c  A family may request a redetermination of the housing assistance 
payment at any time, based on a change in the family's income, size, or 
composition.
    d  Whether reporting of increases of family income between annual 
recertifications is required is determined by the PHA. The PHA policy 
must be stated in its administrative plan.
    (1) Should household income INCREASE to where HUD assistance becomes 
zero, the HAP contract between borrower/owner and the PHA remains in 
effect for 12 more months. When 12 months of ``zero'' assistance occurs, 
the HAP contract automatically terminates. However, if during that year 
the family's income decreases to the level where subsidy is needed 
again, the PHA will resume subsidy payments under the HAP contract after 
notification by the family of the change.
    (2) In both the Rental Certificate and Rental Voucher programs, the 
tenant's lease term runs concurrently with the Housing Assistance 
Contract until the tenant or owner terminates the lease or the PHA 
terminates the contract. In a situation where a tenant's income 
increases to where the tenant does not receive a subsidy for 12 months, 
the owner can offer the tenant a new lease for execution. If the tenant 
fails to execute the new lease after a reasonable time, the owner may 
terminate the tenant's occupancy.
    F  Changes in household size and composition.

[[Page 336]]

    1.  An increase in household size that results in the occupied unit 
not meeting the PHA occupancy standards or housing quality standards 
(namely, overcrowding) requires the PHA to issue the household a new 
rental certificate or rental voucher for a larger unit. The PHA must 
provide assistance to the family in locating another unit. The PHA may 
not terminate the current contract unless the family has rejected with 
good cause the offer of a new unit.
    2.  If the OWNER fails to maintain the dwelling unit at acceptable 
housing quality standards, the PHA may, after unsuccessful efforts to 
correct the problem, terminate or abate the housing assistance payments, 
even though the household continues to occupy the unit.
    3.  A decrease in household size will not necessarily require the 
household to move. In the Rental Voucher Program, the household may rent 
a unit with greater number of bedrooms than indicated on the housing 
voucher and still receive housing assistance. In the Rental Certificate 
Program, the family may continue to receive assistance in the unit if 
the gross rent (contract rent plus utility allowance) is within the fair 
market rent for the smaller size unit appropriate for the size and 
composition of the family.
    G  Limitation of owner's participation in the two programs. HUD's 
regulations provide that assistance under Section 8 Certificates will 
not exceed 40 percent of the total number of units in the project; 
however, this limitation may be exceeded on a case-by-case basis for the 
purpose of relieving hardship of a particular household or households 
with the approval of the HUD field office. There is no corresponding 
limit under the HUD Rental Voucher program. The HUD limits shall not 
affect the number of rental assistance units the project receives 
through FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
    H  Special problems. Any problems on utilizing either the HUD 
Section 8 Certificate or the Rental Voucher program for existing RRH 
projects not covered by this exhibit should be referred to the National 
Office by the State Director.

Exhibit J to Subpart C--Management of Congregate Housing and Group Homes

    I  Purpose: This exhibit prescribes additional requirements for the 
management of congregate housing and group homes. It applies in addition 
to other requirements in this subpart.
    II  Objective: The objective in the management of congregate and 
group home housing is to provide shelter and predetermined services as 
separate components, based on a market study identification of need, 
that are affordable to the housing's tenant base. It is further the 
objective to permit resident tenants to cover their individual medical 
and discretionary needs, and/or service needs or preferences not 
provided or arranged by the housing provider, within their own 
financial, familial and social resources.
    III  Definitions:
    Congregate housing. Residential housing for persons or families who 
are elderly, or have handicaps, or disabilities, consisting of private 
apartments and central dining facilities in which a number of 
preestablished services are provided to tenants (short of those services 
provided by a health care facility that provides health related care and 
services recognized by the medicaid program). Tenants requiring 
additional services not provided by the facility will acquire them or 
provide for them within their own financial, familial, or social 
resources.
    Group home. Housing that is occupied by individuals who are elderly 
or have handicaps or disabilities, sharing living space within a rental 
unit in which a group home resident assistant may be required.
    Service agreement. A written agreement between the borrower and the 
congregate or group home service provider detailing the specific service 
to be provided, the cost of the service, and the length of time the 
service will be provided.
    Service contract. A written contract between the borrower and the 
tenant listing the package of services selected by the tenant that will 
be provided or arranged by the borrower, the fee or fees to be charged, 
and applicable conditions and agreements pertaining thereto.
    Service plan. A written plan describing how services will be 
provided to congregate housing or group home projects. At a minimum, the 
plan must specify the services to be provided, the frequency of the 
services, who will provide the services, how tenants will be advised of 
the availability of services, and the staff needed to provide the 
services.
    Tenant base. The demographic and economic profile of eligible people 
in a housing market area who would benefit, whether by need or 
preference, from the housing and supportive services provided by a 
congregate housing or group home facility located in the market area.
    IV  Rent Subsidy Opportunities: Congregate housing and group homes 
are subject to the provisions of paragraph IV of exhibit B of this 
subpart. Subsidy discussed in that paragraph cannot be used to pay for 
services in congregate housing or group homes.
    V  Management Operations: Borrowers must comply with paragraph V of 
exhibit B of this subpart in managing congregate housing and group 
homes. In addition, borrowers must submit a service plan that explains 
how services will be provided.
    A  Borrower's experience. Borrowers and management agents must 
outline their experience and plans for providing congregate

[[Page 337]]

and group home services when completing the management outline in either 
exhibit B-4 or B-5 of this subpart. Borrowers who are not experienced 
with congregate housing/group homes must obtain assistance from 
organizations or individuals experienced with congregate issues in 
developing management and servicing plans. The service provider's 
experience and ability to furnish the services must be documented.
    B  Management plan. In addition to the general requirements for a 
management plan described at paragraph V A of exhibit B of this subpart, 
the management plan should describe the plan for management of features 
unique and essential to congregate/group home housing. This portion of 
an overall management plan may either be incorporated within the 
framework of the management plan or as an addendum to the plan. The 
following areas should be described:
    1  Tenant mix. For congregate housing, describe the mix of tenants 
who will have a greater number of services and tenants who will have a 
lesser number of services that the project is designed to accommodate. 
For group home housing, describe the ``group(s)'' of tenants the group 
home is intending to serve such as elderly tenants, developmentally 
disabled, or mentally impaired persons.
    2  Marketing plan. Describe the strategies, ways and means that 
marketing and advertising will be focused to attract and retain tenants 
from the market area (tenant base) that would benefit by the congregate/
group home housing project.
    3  Service package. Describe the basic and any alternative 
``package'' of service(s), or combination of service packages, that a 
tenant may acquire at the project. Describe any deviations to a service 
package that can be accommodated on an individual tenant basis by the 
project in a reasonable and practical manner.
    4  Referral service. Describe the plan for identifying other 
services available to tenants and for establishing liaison between the 
project and the other services. Describe the plan to make the 
information of such services available and known to tenants. Describe 
what arrangements the project can provide as part of a service package 
to help tenants use referral services.
    5  Tenant consultation. Describe how the project management staff 
will use tenant consultation to assist tenants with information, 
modification of service package, referral to medical, clinical, family 
or other services, and identifying what, if any, reasonable 
accommodations or assistance are needed and whether they are feasible 
and practical to provide.
    6  Emergency evacuation plan. Describe what the project will do to 
inform and train tenants on safe evacuation of an apartment and 
building. Describe which community/public services will be informed 
about and incorporated into the project evacuation plan.
    C   Service plan. Congregate housing/group home borrowers must 
submit a service plan as defined in paragraph III of this exhibit. See 
exhibit E of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter for guidance on the 
issues that should be included in the plan. The service plan will be an 
addendum to the management plan when appropriate, or subject to the 
signature and authorization requirements of the management plan when the 
service provider is not the borrower or management agent.
    D  Service agreements. Borrowers must submit a service agreement for 
each service they do not provide directly. The agreement must stipulate 
the specific service to be provided, the cost of the service and the 
length of time the service will be provided. The service agreement will 
be an addendum to the management agreement when appropriate, or subject 
to the signature and authorization requirements of the management 
agreement when the service provider is not the borrower or management 
agent.

Initial service agreements must be effective for at least 1 year after 
the project becomes operational. Subsequent agreements must be effective 
for at least 1 year.
    E  Service contract. Borrowers must submit a sample of the service 
contract for Agency review for compliance with Fair Housing Act 
requirements/restrictions and Agency requirements in or referenced by 
this subpart. The service contract may not be a requirement for 
occupancy in the congregate housing project and it must be made separate 
and apart from the occupancy lease agreement.
    VI  Renting Procedure: In addition to meeting the conditions of 
paragraph VI of exhibit B of this subpart, borrowers must meet the 
following conditions.
    A  Eligible tenants. Tenants must meet the general provisions of 
paragraph VI D of exhibit B of this subpart and be eligible to occupy 
congregate or group home housing as defined in paragraph III of this 
exhibit. Borrowers must be careful to follow the condition described in 
paragraph VI D 1 i of exhibit B of this subpart when inquiring about the 
applicant's or tenant's request for congregate/group home housing and 
the service it provides.
    B  Tenant selection. Borrowers must meet the provisions of paragraph 
VI H of exhibit B of this subpart. Borrowers should be further guided by 
the following in selecting tenants for congregate housing and group 
homes:
    1 Congregate housing.
    a  Tenant mix. It is the primary intent of a congregate housing 
project to provide or arrange for service packages made up of various 
component services to serve the needs of tenants needing such services. 
If it is not feasible to provide service packages to all

[[Page 338]]

tenants, the borrower may serve tenants needing services and tenants not 
needing services. The number of tenants that can be served with service 
package(s) will be described in the project management plan. Project 
management should be consulted when establishing the tenant mix. The 
plan should establish a percentage of tenants who will use a service 
package with a greater number of component services as differentiated 
from tenants whose service package will contain fewer services. As 
existing tenants age and new tenants move in, the percentage may 
fluctuate. Farmers Home Association must concur with the proposed plan.
    b  Selecting services needed or wanted by tenants in congregate 
housing.
    (1) It is the borrower's responsibility to inform applicants or 
tenants about the supportive services provided at or by the congregate 
project. Such services or service packages need to be identified on the 
project's application form as part of an application package.
    (2) It is the applicant's or tenant's responsibility to identify and 
request the services or service package provided by the project which 
that person desires or needs.
    (3) The borrower may have the applicant/tenant provide only such 
essential information about the person's desire for provided service(s) 
to determine whether the project provides the services desired by the 
applicant/tenant and/or to determine how to best serve the applicant's/
tenant's request for services with reasonable accommodation, referral 
services, etc. The essential information may include an explanation by 
the applicant/tenant. In the case of a group home, it may also include 
an assessment by a professional medical examiner or practitioner, social 
service caseworker, representative of an advocacy group, member of the 
clergy, etc. that the tenant/applicant provides to support the 
application for housing and services.
    c  Waiting lists. To sustain the number of tenants requesting 
services, management may maintain waiting lists for tenants requesting 
large component service packages, small component service packages, and 
those wanting a service package at a later time. Management may choose 
tenants from the lists in such manner to maintain the feasibility in 
providing services, however, priority in tenant selection should go to 
an applicant requesting a service package over one requesting a service 
package at some later date. The other provisions contained in paragraph 
VI H of exhibit B of this subpart concerning waiting lists are 
applicable.
    2  Group home. A group home may limit occupancy to a specific group 
of tenants. For example, a group home may limit occupancy to eligible 
elderly tenants, developmentally disabled people, or mentally impaired 
tenants. This limitation will be outlined in the borrower's management 
plan. The following will apply to group homes.
    a  Applicants for group home housing must demonstrate their need for 
such housing.
    b  Tenants of group homes cannot be required to be a part of an 
ongoing training or rehabilitation program sponsored by the applicant or 
other organization.
    c  Tenants should be selected from the local area before considering 
other areas.
    C  Determining per unit rental rates for group living arrangements. 
A ``unit'' in a group home consists of the space occupied by a specific 
tenant household. It may be a traditional apartment unit, a bedroom, or 
a portion of a bedroom. Rents are determined as follows:
    1  When all units are of equal size, divide operational costs 
equally.
    2 When all units are not of equal size, determine the size of each 
unit and divide operational costs accordingly.
    a  The size of traditional units is their square footage.
    b  The size of nontraditional units is the bedroom or portion of 
bedroom occupied by the household and portion of the common area to be 
used by all potential units in nontraditional units.
    3  A unit occupied by a resident assistant is not considered a 
revenue producing unit and would be excluded from the rent 
determination.
    VII  Verification and Certification of Tenant Income, and/or 
Employment and Review of Support Services: The provisions of paragraph 
VII of exhibit B of this subpart apply. In addition to recertifying 
income, management should consult with each tenant to explain the 
available support services and determine if the tenant desires any 
available services not presently used and/or if any other practical and 
feasible accommodations can be provided to the tenant.
    VIII  Lease Agreements: In addition to the conditions contained in 
paragraph VIII of exhibit B of this subpart, the following should be 
addressed:
    A  Tenants who request services in congregate housing. If a tenant 
requests services, the lease must contain the following clauses:
    1  ``I understand that use of the service package I have selected is 
not mandatory, and if I later choose to modify or not renew my service 
contract, such action on my part will not cause default under the terms 
of this lease agreement. I further understand and agree that I may not 
use any aspect of dissatisfaction with my service contract as grounds to 
withhold rents due under the terms of this lease agreement.''
    2  ``The lessor warrants that the following basic services will be 
made available to all tenants for a fee separate and apart from any rent 
described in the terms of this lease. The basic services are: 
____________________.


[[Page 339]]


    If these services cannot later be provided, such failure or 
inability to provide the services will not constitute a breach of this 
lease agreement and the lessor will hold the tenant harmless should the 
tenant elect to terminate this lease on the grounds that provision of 
these services was cause for the tenant to apply for and accept 
occupancy in this congregate housing project.''

    B  Services provided to people other than tenants of FmHA or its 
successor agency under Public Law 103-354 financed congregate housing. 
If the meal facility serves people other than the tenants of the 
project, the borrower must obtain a lease from the service provider and 
require payment sufficient to cover the annual operating expenses, debt 
services and reserve account attributable to the portion of increased 
space that is in excess of the needs of the tenants in the project. 
Tenants of the congregate housing must have priority in receiving the 
services. When the facilities are provided with loan funds, the 
following conditions must be met:
    1  The services to be provided and the fees to be charged (if any) 
must be fully documented in the service plan, if provided by the 
applicant, or in the service plan and lease agreement if the services 
will be provided by others.
    2 Any lease agreement must be approved by the State Director or the 
loan approving official and contain the following statement: ``This 
agreement will not be effective until approved by the State Director of 
the Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 
103-354, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the State Director's 
delegated representative.''
    IX  Rent Collection: The provisions of paragraph IX of exhibit B of 
this subpart will apply for services as well as rent. Tenants must pay 
charges for the services as documented in their lease. The payment for 
rent or services may be made separately or combined; however, payments 
for rent and services must be accounted for separately.
    X  Borrower Project Budgets: Borrowers must separate the revenue and 
expenses of project operations from the service component. Form FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-7, ``Multiple Family 
Housing Project Budget,'' must reflect project operations only. Also, if 
project employees provide any part of the services, the project 
operation budget and the services budget must reflect the proration of 
employee compensation between the respective budgets as further 
described in exhibit E of subpart E of part 1944 of this chapter.
    XI  Accounting and Reporting Requirements and Financial Management 
Analysis: Borrowers must maintain separate financial records for the 
operation and maintenance of the project and the service component. 
Funds allocated to the operation and maintenance of the project may not 
be used to supplement the cost of services, nor may service component 
funds be used to supplement the project operation and maintenance. 
Detailed financial reports on the service component will not be required 
unless specifically requested by FmHA or its successor agency under 
Public Law 103-354, and then only to the extent necessary for FmHA or 
its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and the borrower to 
discuss the affordability (and competitiveness) of the service component 
by the tenant base in keeping with the objective stated in paragraph II 
of this exhibit. The project audit, or verification of accounts on Form 
FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1930-8, ``Multiple 
Family Housing Balance Sheet,'' together with an accompanying Form 1930-
7 showing actuals, must allocate revenue and expense between project 
operations and the service component.
    XII  Termination of Tenancy and Eviction. In keeping with the spirit 
and provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, a tenant 
living in congregate or group home housing project may remain as long as 
they are eligible to occupy and the tenant expresses or otherwise 
maintains they can care for themself with or without services provided 
by the project, or by familial or social services from outside the 
project. Tenants are otherwise bound by the terms of their lease and 
their occupancy may be terminated only according to the provisions 
contained in paragraph XIV of exhibit B of this subpart.
