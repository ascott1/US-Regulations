                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2002), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 1.2  Business to be transacted in writing.

    All business with the Patent and Trademark Office should be 
transacted in writing. The personal attendance of applicants or their 
attorneys or agents at the Patent and Trademark Office is unnecessary. 
The action of the Patent and Trademark Office will be based exclusively 
on the written record in the Office. No attention will be paid to any 
alleged oral promise, stipulation, or understanding in relation to which 
there is disagreement or doubt.


<R05>
Sec. 1.3  Business to be conducted with decorum and courtesy.

    Applicants and their attorneys or agents are required to conduct 
their business with the Patent and Trademark Office with decorum and 
courtesy. Papers presented in violation of this requirement will be 
submitted to the Commissioner and will be returned by the Commissioner's 
direct order. Complaints against examiners and other employees must be 
made in correspondence separate from other papers.

[61 FR 56446, Nov. 1, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 1.4  Nature of correspondence and signature requirements.

    (a) Correspondence with the Patent and Trademark Office comprises:
    (1) Correspondence relating to services and facilities of the 
Office, such as general inquiries, requests for publications supplied by 
the Office, orders for printed copies of patents or trademark 
registrations, orders for copies of

[[Page 14]]

records, transmission of assignments for recording, and the like, and
    (2) Correspondence in and relating to a particular application or 
other proceeding in the Office. See particularly the rules relating to 
the filing, processing, or other proceedings of national applications in 
subpart B, Secs. 1.31 to 1.378; of international applications in subpart 
C, Secs. 1.401 to 1.499; of ex parte reexaminations of patents in 
subpart D, Secs. 1.501 to 1.570; of interferences in subpart E, 
Secs. 1.601 to 1.690; of extension of patent term in subpart F, 
Secs. 1.710 to 1.785; of inter partes reexaminations of patents in 
subpart H, Secs. 1.902 to 1.997; and of trademark applications 
Secs. 2.11 to 2.189.
    (b) Since each file must be complete in itself, a separate copy of 
every paper to be filed in a patent or trademark application, patent 
file, trademark registration file, or other proceeding must be furnished 
for each file to which the paper pertains, even though the contents of 
the papers filed in two or more files may be identical. The filing of 
duplicate copies of correspondence in the file of an application, 
patent, trademark registration file, or other proceeding should be 
avoided, except in situations in which the Office requires the filing of 
duplicate copies. The Office may dispose of duplicate copies of 
correspondence in the file of an application, patent, trademark 
registration file, or other proceeding.
    (c) Since different matters may be considered by different branches 
or sections of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, each 
distinct subject, inquiry or order must be contained in a separate paper 
to avoid confusion and delay in answering papers dealing with different 
subjects.
    (d)(1) Each piece of correspondence, except as provided in 
paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, filed in an application, patent 
file, trademark registration file, or other proceeding in the Office 
which requires a person's signature, must:
    (i) Be an original, that is, have an original signature personally 
signed in permanent ink by that person; or
    (ii) Be a direct or indirect copy, such as a photocopy or facsimile 
transmission(Sec. 1.6(d)), of an original. In the event that a copy of 
the original is filed, the original should be retained as evidence of 
authenticity. If a question of authenticity arises, the Office may 
require submission of the original; or
    (iii) Where an electronically transmitted trademark filing is 
permitted, the person who signs the filing must either:
    (A) Place a symbol comprised of numbers and/or letters between two 
forward slash marks in the signature block on the electronic submission; 
and print, sign and date in permanent ink, and maintain a paper copy of 
the electronic submission; or
    (B) Sign the verified statement using some other form of electronic 
signature specified by the Commissioner.
    (2) The presentation to the Office (whether by signing, filing, 
submitting, or later advocating) of any paper by a party, whether a 
practitioner or non-practitioner, constitutes a certification under 
Sec. 10.18(b) of this chapter. Violations of Sec. 10.18(b)(2) of this 
chapter by a party, whether a practitioner or non-practitioner, may 
result in the imposition of sanctions under Sec. 10.18(c) of this 
chapter. Any practitioner violating Sec. 10.18(b) may also be subject to 
disciplinary action. See Secs. 10.18(d) and 10.23(c)(15).
    (e) Correspondence requiring a person's signature and relating to 
registration to practice before the Patent and Trademark Office in 
patent cases, enrollment and disciplinary investigations, or 
disciplinary proceedings must be submitted with an original signature 
personally signed in permanent ink by that person.
    (f) When a document that is required by statute to be certified must 
be filed, a copy, including a photocopy or facsimile transmission, of 
the certification is not acceptable.
    (g) An applicant who has not made of record a registered attorney or 
agent may be required to state whether assistance was received in the 
preparation or prosecution of the patent application, for which any 
compensation or consideration was given or charged, and if so, to 
disclose the name or names of the person or persons providing such 
assistance. Assistance includes the preparation for the applicant of the 
specification and amendments or other papers to be filed in the

[[Page 15]]

Patent and Trademark Office, as well as other assistance in such 
matters, but does not include merely making drawings by draftsmen or 
stenographic services in typing papers.

Sec. 1.5  Identification of application, patent or registration.

    (a) No correspondence relating to an application should be filed 
prior to receipt of the application number from the Patent and Trademark 
Office. When a letter directed to the Patent and Trademark Office 
concerns a previously filed application for a patent, it must identify 
on the top page in a conspicuous location, the application number 
(consisting of the series code and the serial number; e.g., 07/123,456), 
or the serial number and filing date assigned to that application by the 
Patent and Trademark Office, or the international application number of 
the international application. Any correspondence not containing such 
identification will be returned to the sender where a return address is 
available. The returned correspondence will be accompanied by a cover 
letter which will indicate to the sender that if the returned 
correspondence is resubmitted to the Patent and Trademark Office within 
two weeks of the mailing date on the cover letter, the original date of 
receipt of the correspondence will be considered by the Patent and 
Trademark Office as the date of receipt of the correspondence. 
Applicants may use either the Certificate of Mailing or Transmission 
procedure under Sec. 1.8 or the Express Mail procedure under Sec. 1.10 
for resubmissions of returned correspondence if they desire to have the 
benefit of the date of deposit with the United States Postal Service. If 
the returned correspondence is not resubmitted within the two-week 
period, the date of receipt of the resubmission will be considered to be 
the date of receipt of the correspondence. The two-week period to 
resubmit the returned correspondence will not be extended. In addition 
to the application number, all letters directed to the Patent and 
Trademark Office concerning applications for patents should also state 
the name of the applicant, the title of the invention, the date of 
filing the same, and, if known, the group art unit or other unit within 
the Patent and Trademark Office responsible for considering the letter 
and the name of the examiner or other person to which it has been 
assigned.
    (b) When the letter concerns a patent other than for purposes of 
paying a maintenance fee, it should state the number and date of issue 
of the patent, the name of the patentee, and the title of the invention. 
For letters concerning payment of a maintenance fee in a patent, see the 
provisions of Sec. 1.366(c).
    (c)(1) A letter about a trademark application should identify the 
serial number, the name of the applicant, and the mark.
    (2) A letter about a registered trademark should identify the 
registration number, the name of the registrant, and the mark.
    (d) A letter relating to a reexamination proceeding should identify 
it as such by the number of the patent undergoing reexamination, the 
reexamination request control number assigned to such proceeding and, if 
known, the group art unit and name of the examiner to which it has been 
assigned.
    (e) When a paper concerns an interference, it should state the names 
of the parties and the number of the interference. The name of the 
examiner-in-chief assigned to the interference (Sec. 1.610) and the name 
of the party filing the paper should appear conspicuously on the first 
page of the paper.
    (f) When a paper concerns a provisional application, it should 
identify the application as such and include the application number.

Sec. 1.10  Filing of correspondence by ``Express Mail.''

    (a)(1) Any correspondence received by the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office (USPTO) that was delivered by the ``Express Mail Post Office to 
Addressee'' service of the United States Postal Service (USPS) will be 
considered filed with the USPTO on the date of deposit with the USPS, 
except for documents described in the following paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and 
(ii) of this section:
    (i) Trademark applications filed under section 1 or 44 of the 
Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. 1051 and 1126.
    (ii) Other documents for which a Trademark Electronic Application 
System (TEAS) form exists:
    (A) Amendment to allege use under section 1(c) of the Trademark Act, 
15 U.S.C. 1051(c);
    (B) Statement of use under section 1(d) of the Trademark Act, 15 
U.S.C. 1051(d);
    (C) Request for extension of time to file a statement of use under 
section 1(d) of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. 1051(d);
    (D) Affidavit of continued use under section 8 of the Trademark Act, 
15 U.S.C. 1058;
    (E) Renewal request under section 9 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. 
1059; and
    (F) Requests to change or correct addresses.
    (2) The date of deposit with USPS is shown by the ``date in'' on the 
``Express Mail'' label or other official USPS notation. If the USPS 
deposit date cannot be determined, the correspondence will be accorded 
the USPTO receipt date as the filing date. See Sec. 1.6(a).
    (b) Correspondence should be deposited directly with an employee of 
the USPS to ensure that the person depositing the correspondence 
receives a legible copy of the ``Express Mail'' mailing label with the 
``date-in'' clearly marked. Persons dealing indirectly with the 
employees of the USPS (such as by deposit in an ``Express Mail'' drop 
box) do so at the risk of not receiving a copy of the ``Express Mail'' 
mailing label with the desired ``date-in'' clearly marked. The paper(s) 
or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence should also include the 
``Express Mail'' mailing label number thereon. See paragraphs (c), (d) 
and (e) of this section.
    (c) Any person filing correspondence under this section that was 
received by the Office and delivered by the ``Express Mail Post Office 
to Addressee'' service of the USPS, who can show that there is a 
discrepancy between the filing date accorded by the Office to the 
correspondence and the date of deposit as shown by the ``date-in'' on 
the ``Express Mail'' mailing label or other official USPS notation, may 
petition the Commissioner to accord the correspondence a filing date as 
of the ``date-in'' on the ``Express Mail'' mailing label or other 
official USPS notation, provided that:
    (1) The petition is filed promptly after the person becomes aware 
that the Office has accorded, or will accord, a filing date other than 
the USPS deposit date;
    (2) The number of the ``Express Mail'' mailing label was placed on 
the

[[Page 20]]

paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence prior to the 
original mailing by ``Express Mail;'' and
    (3) The petition includes a true copy of the ``Express Mail'' 
mailing label showing the ``date-in,'' and of any other official 
notation by the USPS relied upon to show the date of deposit.
    (d) Any person filing correspondence under this section that was 
received by the Office and delivered by the ``Express Mail Post Office 
to Addressee'' service of the USPS, who can show that the ``date-in'' on 
the ``Express Mail'' mailing label or other official notation entered by 
the USPS was incorrectly entered or omitted by the USPS, may petition 
the Commissioner to accord the correspondence a filing date as of the 
date the correspondence is shown to have been deposited with the USPS, 
provided that:
    (1) The petition is filed promptly after the person becomes aware 
that the Office has accorded, or will accord, a filing date based upon 
an incorrect entry by the USPS;
    (2) The number of the ``Express Mail'' mailing label was placed on 
the paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence prior to the 
original mailing by ``Express Mail''; and
    (3) The petition includes a showing which establishes, to the 
satisfaction of the Commissioner, that the requested filing date was the 
date the correspondence was deposited in the ``Express Mail Post Office 
to Addressee'' service prior to the last scheduled pickup for that day. 
Any showing pursuant to this paragraph must be corroborated by evidence 
from the USPS or that came into being after deposit and within one 
business day of the deposit of the correspondence in the ``Express Mail 
Post Office to Addressee'' service of the USPS.
    (e) Any person mailing correspondence addressed as set out in 
Sec. 1.1(a) to the Office with sufficient postage utilizing the 
``Express Mail Post Office to Addressee'' service of the USPS but not 
received by the Office, may petition the Commissioner to consider such 
correspondence filed in the Office on the USPS deposit date, provided 
that:
    (1) The petition is filed promptly after the person becomes aware 
that the Office has no evidence of receipt of the correspondence;
    (2) The number of the ``Express Mail'' mailing label was placed on 
the paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence prior to the 
original mailing by ``Express Mail'';
    (3) The petition includes a copy of the originally deposited 
paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence showing the number 
of the ``Express Mail'' mailing label thereon, a copy of any returned 
postcard receipt, a copy of the ``Express Mail'' mailing label showing 
the ``date-in,'' a copy of any other official notation by the USPS 
relied upon to show the date of deposit, and, if the requested filing 
date is a date other than the ``date-in'' on the ``Express Mail'' 
mailing label or other official notation entered by the USPS, a showing 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section that the requested filing 
date was the date the correspondence was deposited in the ``Express Mail 
Post Office to Addressee'' service prior to the last scheduled pickup 
for that day; and
    (4) The petition includes a statement which establishes, to the 
satisfaction of the Commissioner, the original deposit of the 
correspondence and that the copies of the correspondence, the copy of 
the ``Express Mail'' mailing label, the copy of any returned postcard 
receipt, and any official notation entered by the USPS are true copies 
of the originally mailed correspondence, original ``Express Mail'' 
mailing label, returned postcard receipt, and official notation entered 
by the USPS.
    (f) The Office may require additional evidence to determine if the 
correspondence was deposited as ``Express Mail'' with the USPS on the 
date in question.

patents which appear to disclose, purport to disclose or do disclose 
inventions or discoveries relating to atomic energy are reported to the 
Department of Energy, which Department will be given access to the

Sec. 1.22  Fees payable in advance.

    (a) Patent and trademark fees and charges payable to the Patent and 
Trademark Office are required to be paid in advance, that is, at the 
time of requesting any action by the Office for which a fee or charge is 
payable with the exception that under Sec. 1.53 applications for patent 
may be assigned a filing date without payment of the basic filing fee.
    (b) All fees paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office 
must be itemized in each individual application, patent, trademark 
registration file, or other proceeding in such a manner that it is clear 
for which purpose the fees are paid. The Office may return fees that are 
not itemized as required by this paragraph. The provisions of 
Sec. 1.5(a) do not apply to the resubmission of fees returned pursuant 
to this paragraph.

Sec. 1.23  Methods of payment.

    (a) All payments of money required for United States Patent and 
Trademark Office fees, including fees for the processing of 
international applications (Sec. 1.445), shall be made in U.S. dollars 
and in the form of a cashier's or certified check, Treasury note, 
national bank notes, or United States Postal Service money order. If 
sent in any other form, the Office may delay or cancel the credit until 
collection is made. Checks and money orders must be made payable to the 
Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. (Checks made 
payable to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks will continue to 
be accepted.) Payments from foreign countries must be payable and 
immediately negotiable in the United States for the full amount of the 
fee required. Money sent to the Office by mail will be at the risk of 
the sender, and letters containing money should be registered with the 
United States Postal Service.
    (b) Payments of money required for United States Patent and 
Trademark Office fees may also be made by credit card. Payment of a fee 
by credit card must specify the amount to be charged to the credit card 
and such other information as is necessary to process the charge, and is 
subject to collection of the fee. The Office will not accept a general 
authorization to charge fees to a credit card. If credit card 
information is provided on a form or document other than a form provided 
by the Office for the payment of fees by credit card, the Office will 
not be liable if the credit card number becomes public knowledge.

Sec. 1.25  Deposit accounts.

    (a) For the convenience of attorneys, and the general public in 
paying any fees due, in ordering services offered by the Office, copies 
of records, etc., deposit accounts may be established in the Patent and 
Trademark Office upon payment of the fee for establishing a deposit 
account (Sec. 1.21(b)(1)). A minimum deposit of $1,000 is required for 
paying any fees due or in ordering any

[[Page 32]]

services offered by the Office. However, a minimum deposit of $300 may 
be paid to establish a restricted subscription deposit account used 
exclusively for subscription order of patent copies as issued. At the 
end of each month, a deposit account statement will be rendered. A 
remittance must be made promptly upon receipt of the statement to cover 
the value of items or services charged to the account and thus restore 
the account to its established normal deposit. An amount sufficient to 
cover all fees, services, copies, etc., requested must always be on 
deposit. Charges to accounts with insufficient funds will not be 
accepted. A service charge (Sec. 1.21(b)(2)) will be assessed for each 
month that the balance at the end of the month is below $1,000. For 
restricted subscription deposit accounts, a service charge 
(Sec. 1.21(b)(3)) will be assessed for each month that the balance at 
the end of the month is below $300.
    (b) Filing, issue, appeal, international-type search report, 
international application processing, petition, and post-issuance fees 
may be charged against these accounts if sufficient funds are on deposit 
to cover such fees. A general authorization to charge all fees, or only 
certain fees, set forth in Secs. 1.16 to 1.18 to a deposit account 
containing sufficient funds may be filed in an individual application, 
either for the entire pendency of the application or with a particular 
paper filed. An authorization to charge fees under Sec. 1.16 in an 
international application entering the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 
371 will be treated as an authorization to charge fees under Sec. 1.492. 
An authorization to charge fees set forth in Sec. 1.18 to a deposit 
account is subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.311(b). An authorization 
to charge to a deposit account the fee for a request for reexamination 
pursuant to Sec. 1.510 or Sec. 1.913 and any other fees required in a 
reexamination proceeding in a patent may also be filed with the request 
for reexamination. An authorization to charge a fee to a deposit account 
will not be considered payment of the fee on the date the authorization 
to charge the fee is effective as to the particular fee to be charged 
unless sufficient funds are present in the account to cover the fee.

Sec. 1.26  Refunds.

    (a) The Commissioner may refund any fee paid by mistake or in excess 
of that required. A change of purpose after the payment of a fee, such 
as when a party desires to withdraw a patent or trademark filing for 
which the fee was paid, including an application, an appeal, or a 
request for an oral hearing, will not entitle a party to a refund of 
such fee. The Office will not refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or 
less unless a refund is specifically requested, and will not notify the 
payor of such amounts. If a party paying a fee or requesting a refund 
does not provide the banking information necessary for making refunds by 
electronic funds transfer (31 U.S.C. 3332 and 31 CFR part 208), or 
instruct the Office that refunds are to be credited to a deposit 
account, the Commissioner may require such information, or use the 
banking information on the payment instrument to make a refund. Any 
refund of a fee paid by credit card will be by a credit to the credit 
card account to which the fee was charged.
    (b) Any request for refund must be filed within two years from the 
date the fee was paid, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or 
in Sec. 1.28(a). If the Office charges a deposit account by an amount 
other than an amount specifically indicated in an authorization 
(Sec. 1.25(b)), any request for refund based upon such charge must be 
filed within two years from the date of the deposit account statement 
indicating such charge, and include a copy of that deposit account 
statement. The time periods set forth in this paragraph are not 
extendable.
    (c) If the Commissioner decides not to institute a reexamination 
proceeding, for ex parte reexaminations filed under Sec. 1.510, a refund 
of $1,690 will be made to the reexamination requester. For inter partes 
reexaminations filed under Sec. 1.913, a refund of

[[Page 33]]

$7,970 will be made to the reexamination requester. The reexamination 
requester should indicate the form in which any refund should be made 
(e.g., by check, electronic funds transfer, credit to a deposit account, 
etc.). Generally, reexamination refunds will be issued in the form that 
the original payment was provided.

Sec. 1.27  Definition of small entities and establishing status as a small
 
entity to permit payment of small entity fees; when a determination of 
entitlement to 
          small entity status and notification of loss of entitlement to 
          small entity status are required; fraud on the Office.

    (a) Definition of small entities. A small entity as used in this 
chapter means any party (person, small business concern, or nonprofit 
organization) under paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.
    (1) Person. A person, as used in paragraph (c) of this section, 
means any inventor or other individual (e.g., an individual to whom an 
inventor has transferred some rights in the invention), who has not 
assigned, granted, conveyed, or licensed, and is under no obligation 
under contract or law to assign, grant, convey, or license, any rights 
in the invention. An inventor or other individual who has transferred 
some rights, or is under an obligation to transfer some rights in the 
invention to one or more parties, can also qualify for small entity 
status if all the parties who have had rights in the invention 
transferred to them also qualify for small entity status either as a 
person, small business concern, or nonprofit organization under this 
section.
    (2) Small business concern. A small business concern, as used in 
paragraph (c) of this section, means any business concern that:
    (i) Has not assigned, granted, conveyed, or licensed, and is under 
no obligation under contract or law to assign, grant, convey, or 
license, any rights in the invention to any person, concern, or 
organization which would not qualify for small entity status as a 
person, small business concern, or nonprofit organization.
    (ii) Meets the standards set forth in 13 CFR part 121 to be eligible 
for reduced patent fees. Questions related to standards for a small 
business concern may be directed to: Small Business Administration, Size 
Standards Staff, 409 Third Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20416.
    (3) Nonprofit Organization. A nonprofit organization, as used in 
paragraph (c) of this section, means any nonprofit organization that:
    (i) Has not assigned, granted, conveyed, or licensed, and is under 
no obligation under contract or law to assign, grant, convey, or 
license, any rights in the invention to any person, concern, or 
organization which would not qualify as a person, small business 
concern, or a nonprofit organization, and
    (ii) Is either:
    (A) A university or other institution of higher education located in 
any country;
    (B) An organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) and exempt from 
taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 
501(a));
    (C) Any nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified 
under a nonprofit organization statute of a state of this country (35 
U.S.C. 201(i)); or
    (D) Any nonprofit organization located in a foreign country which 
would qualify as a nonprofit organization under paragraphs (a)(3)(ii)(B) 
of this section or (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section if it were located in 
this country.
    (4) License to a Federal agency. (i) For persons under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, a license to the Government resulting from a 
rights determination under Executive Order 10096 does not constitute a 
license so as to prohibit claiming small entity status.
    (ii) For small business concerns and nonprofit organizations under 
paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, a license to a Federal 
agency resulting from a funding agreement with that agency pursuant to 
35 U.S.C. 202(c)(4) does not constitute a license for the

[[Page 34]]

purposes of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(3)(i) of this section.
    (b) Establishment of small entity status permits payment of reduced 
fees. A small entity, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, who 
has properly asserted entitlement to small entity status pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section will be accorded small entity status by 
the Office in the particular application or patent in which entitlement 
to small entity status was asserted. Establishment of small entity 
status allows the payment of certain reduced patent fees pursuant to 35 
U.S.C. 41(h).
    (c) Assertion of small entity status. Any party (person, small 
business concern or nonprofit organization) should make a determination, 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, of entitlement to be accorded 
small entity status based on the definitions set forth in paragraph (a) 
of this section, and must, in order to establish small entity status for 
the purpose of paying small entity fees, actually make an assertion of 
entitlement to small entity status, in the manner set forth in 
paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(3) of this section, in the application or 
patent in which such small entity fees are to be paid.
    (1) Assertion by writing. Small entity status may be established by 
a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status. A written 
assertion must:
    (i) Be clearly identifiable;
    (ii) Be signed (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section); and
    (iii) Convey the concept of entitlement to small entity status, such 
as by stating that applicant is a small entity, or that small entity 
status is entitled to be asserted for the application or patent. While 
no specific words or wording are required to assert small entity status, 
the intent to assert small entity status must be clearly indicated in 
order to comply with the assertion requirement.
    (2) Parties who can sign and file the written assertion. The written 
assertion can be signed by:
    (i) One of the parties identified in Sec. 1.33(b) (e.g., an attorney 
or agent registered with the Office), Sec. 3.73(b) of this chapter 
notwithstanding, who can also file the written assertion;
    (ii) At least one of the individuals identified as an inventor (even 
though a Sec. 1.63 executed oath or declaration has not been submitted), 
notwithstanding Sec. 1.33(b)(4), who can also file the written assertion 
pursuant to the exception under Sec. 1.33(b) of this part; or
    (iii) An assignee of an undivided part interest, notwithstanding 
Secs. 1.33(b)(3) and 3.73(b) of this chapter, but the partial assignee 
cannot file the assertion without resort to a party identified under 
Sec. 1.33(b) of this part.
    (3) Assertion by payment of the small entity basic filing or basic 
national fee. The payment, by any party, of the exact amount of one of 
the small entity basic filing fees set forth in Secs. 1.16(a), (f), (g), 
(h), or (k), or one of the small entity basic national fees set forth in 
Secs. 1.492(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), or (a)(5), will be treated as 
a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status even if the 
type of basic filing or basic national fee is inadvertently selected in 
error.
    (i) If the Office accords small entity status based on payment of a 
small entity basic filing or basic national fee under paragraph (c)(3) 
of this section that is not applicable to that application, any balance 
of the small entity fee that is applicable to that application will be 
due along with the appropriate surcharge set forth in Sec. 1.16(e), or 
Sec. 1.16(l).
    (ii) The payment of any small entity fee other than those set forth 
in paragraph (c)(3) of this section (whether in the exact fee amount or 
not) will not be treated as a written assertion of entitlement to small 
entity status and will not be sufficient to establish small entity 
status in an application or a patent.
    (4) Assertion required in related, continuing, and reissue 
applications. Status as a small entity must be specifically established 
by an assertion in each related, continuing and reissue application in 
which status is appropriate and desired. Status as a small entity in one 
application or patent does not affect the status of any other 
application or patent, regardless of the relationship of the 
applications or patents. The refiling of an application under Sec. 1.53 
as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application 
(including a continued prosecution application under Sec. 1.53(d)), or 
the filing of a reissue

[[Page 35]]

application, requires a new assertion as to continued entitlement to 
small entity status for the continuing or reissue application.
    (d) When small entity fees can be paid. Any fee, other than the 
small entity basic filing fees and the small entity national fees of 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, can be paid in the small entity amount 
only if it is submitted with, or subsequent to, the submission of a 
written assertion of entitlement to small entity status, except when 
refunds are permitted by Sec. 1.28(a).
    (e) Only one assertion required. (1) An assertion of small entity 
status need only be filed once in an application or patent. Small entity 
status, once established, remains in effect until changed pursuant to 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Where an assignment of rights or an 
obligation to assign rights to other parties who are small entities 
occurs subsequent to an assertion of small entity status, a second 
assertion is not required.
    (2) Once small entity status is withdrawn pursuant to paragraph 
(g)(2) of this section, a new written assertion is required to again 
obtain small entity status.
    (f) Assertion requires a determination of entitlement to pay small 
entity fees. Prior to submitting an assertion of entitlement to small 
entity status in an application, including a related, continuing, or 
reissue application, a determination of such entitlement should be made 
pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. It should 
be determined that all parties holding rights in the invention qualify 
for small entity status. The Office will generally not question any 
assertion of small entity status that is made in accordance with the 
requirements of this section, but note paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g)(1) New determination of entitlement to small entity status is 
needed when issue and maintenance fees are due. Once status as a small 
entity has been established in an application or patent, fees as a small 
entity may thereafter be paid in that application or patent without 
regard to a change in status until the issue fee is due or any 
maintenance fee is due.
    (2) Notification of loss of entitlement to small entity status is 
required when issue and maintenance fees are due. Notification of a loss 
of entitlement to small entity status must be filed in the application 
or patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest of the 
issue fee or any maintenance fee due after the date on which status as a 
small entity as defined in paragraph (a) of this section is no longer 
appropriate. The notification that small entity status is no longer 
appropriate must be signed by a party identified in Sec. 1.33(b). 
Payment of a fee in other than the small entity amount is not sufficient 
notification that small entity status is no longer appropriate.
    (h) Fraud attempted or practiced on the Office.
    (1) Any attempt to fraudulently establish status as a small entity, 
or pay fees as a small entity, shall be considered as a fraud practiced 
or attempted on the Office.
    (2) Improperly, and with intent to deceive, establishing status as a 
small entity, or paying fees as a small entity, shall be considered as a 
fraud practiced or attempted on the Office.

Sec. 1.28  Refunds when small entity status is later established; how errors in small entity status are excused.

    (a) Refunds based on later establishment of small entity status. A 
refund pursuant to Sec. 1.26, based on establishment of small entity 
status, of a portion of fees timely paid in full prior to establishing 
status as a small entity may only be obtained if an assertion under 
Sec. 1.27(c) and a request for a refund of the excess amount are filed 
within three months of the date of the timely payment of the full fee. 
The three-month time period is not extendable under Sec. 1.136. Status 
as a small entity is waived for any fee by the failure to establish the 
status prior to paying, at the time of paying, or within three months of 
the date of payment of, the full fee.
    (b) Date of payment. (1) The three-month period for requesting a 
refund, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, starts on the date 
that a full fee has been paid;

[[Page 36]]

    (2) The date when a deficiency payment is paid in full determines 
the amount of deficiency that is due, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) How errors in small entity status are excused. If status as a 
small entity is established in good faith, and fees as a small entity 
are paid in good faith, in any application or patent, and it is later 
discovered that such status as a small entity was established in error, 
or that through error the Office was not notified of a loss of 
entitlement to small entity status as required by Sec. 1.27(g)(2), the 
error will be excused upon: compliance with the separate submission and 
itemization requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this 
section, and the deficiency payment requirement of paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section:
    (1) Separate submission required for each application or patent. Any 
paper submitted under this paragraph must be limited to the deficiency 
payment (all fees paid in error), required by paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, for one application or one patent. Where more than one 
application or patent is involved, separate submissions of deficiency 
payments (e.g., checks) and itemizations are required for each 
application or patent. See Sec. 1.4(b).
    (2) Payment of deficiency owed. The deficiency owed, resulting from 
the previous erroneous payment of small entity fees, must be paid.
    (i) Calculation of the deficiency owed. The deficiency owed for each 
previous fee erroneously paid as a small entity is the difference 
between the current fee amount (for other than a small entity) on the 
date the deficiency is paid in full and the amount of the previous 
erroneous (small entity) fee payment. The total deficiency payment owed 
is the sum of the individual deficiency owed amounts for each fee amount 
previously erroneously paid as a small entity. Where a fee paid in error 
as a small entity was subject to a fee decrease between the time the fee 
was paid in error and the time the deficiency is paid in full, the 
deficiency owed is equal to the amount (previously) paid in error;
    (ii) Itemization of the deficiency payment. An itemization of the 
total deficiency payment is required. The itemization must include the 
following information:
    (A) Each particular type of fee that was erroneously paid as a small 
entity, (e.g., basic statutory filing fee, two-month extension of time 
fee) along with the current fee amount for a non-small entity;
    (B) The small entity fee actually paid, and when. This will permit 
the Office to differentiate, for example, between two one-month 
extension of time fees erroneously paid as a small entity but on 
different dates;
    (C) The deficiency owed amount (for each fee erroneously paid); and
    (D) The total deficiency payment owed, which is the sum or total of 
the individual deficiency owed amounts set forth in paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (3) Failure to comply with requirements. If the requirements of 
paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section are not complied with, such 
failure will either: be treated as an authorization for the Office to 
process the deficiency payment and charge the processing fee set forth 
in Sec. 1.17(i), or result in a requirement for compliance within a one-
month non-extendable time period under Sec. 1.136(a) to avoid the return 
of the fee deficiency paper, at the option of the Office.
    (d) Payment of deficiency operates as notification of loss of 
status. Any deficiency payment (based on a previous erroneous payment of 
a small entity fee) submitted under paragraph (c) of this section will 
be treated under Sec. 1.27(g)(2) as a notification of a loss of 
entitlement to small entity status.

<R05>
Sec. 1.32  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.33  Correspondence respecting patent applications, reexamination proceedings, and other proceedings.

    (a) Correspondence address and daytime telephone number. When filing 
an application, a correspondence address must be set forth in either an 
application data sheet (Sec. 1.76), or elsewhere, in a clearly 
identifiable manner, in any paper submitted with an application filing. 
If no correspondence address is specified, the Office may treat the 
mailing address of the first named inventor (if provided, see 
Secs. 1.76(b)(1) and 1.63(c)(2)) as the correspondence address. The 
Office will direct all notices, official letters, and other 
communications relating to the application to the correspondence 
address. The Office will not engage in double correspondence with an 
applicant and a registered attorney or agent, or with more than one 
registered attorney or agent except as deemed necessary by the 
Commissioner. If more than one correspondence address is specified, the 
Office will establish one as the correspondence address. For the party 
to whom correspondence is to be addressed, a daytime telephone number 
should be supplied in a clearly identifiable manner and may be changed 
by any party who may change the correspondence address. The 
correspondence address may be changed as follows:
    (1) Prior to filing of a Sec. 1.63 oath or declaration by any of the 
inventors. If a Sec. 1.63 oath or declaration has not been filed by any 
of the inventors, the correspondence address may be changed by the party 
who filed the application. If the application was filed by a registered 
attorney or agent, any other registered practitioner named in the 
transmittal papers may also change the correspondence address. Thus, the 
inventor(s), any registered practitioner named in the transmittal papers 
accompanying the original application, or a party that will be the 
assignee who filed the application, may change the correspondence 
address in that application under this paragraph.
    (2) Where a Sec. 1.63 oath or declaration has been filed by any of 
the inventors. If a Sec. 1.63 oath or declaration has been filed, or is 
filed concurrent with the filing of an application, by any of the 
inventors, the correspondence address may be changed by the parties set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section, except for paragraph (b)(2).
    (b) Amendments and other papers. Amendments and other papers, except 
for written assertions pursuant to Sec. 1.27(c)(2)(ii) of this part, 
filed in the application must be signed by:
    (1) A registered attorney or agent of record appointed in compliance 
with Sec. 1.34(b);
    (2) A registered attorney or agent not of record who acts in a 
representative capacity under the provisions of Sec. 1.34(a);
    (3) An assignee as provided for under Sec. 3.71(b) of this chapter; 
or
    (4) All of the applicants (Sec. 1.41(b)) for patent, unless there is 
an assignee of the entire interest and such assignee has taken action in 
the application in accordance with Sec. 3.71 of this chapter.
    (c) All notices, official letters, and other communications for the 
patent owner or owners in a reexamination proceeding will be directed to 
the attorney or agent of record (see Sec. 1.34(b)) in the patent file at 
the address listed on the register of patent attorneys and agents 
maintained pursuant to Secs. 10.5 and 10.11 or, if no attorney or agent 
is of record, to the patent owner or owners at the address or addresses 
of record. Amendments and other papers filed in a reexamination 
proceeding on behalf of the patent owner must be signed by the patent 
owner, or if there is more than one owner by all the owners, or by an 
attorney or agent of record in the patent file, or by a registered 
attorney or agent not of record who acts in a representative capacity 
under the provisions of Sec. 1.34(a). Double correspondence with the 
patent owner or owners and the patent owner's attorney or agent, or with 
more than one attorney or agent, will not be undertaken. If more than 
one attorney or agent is of record and a correspondence

[[Page 38]]

address has not been specified, correspondence will be held with the 
last attorney or agent made of record.
    (d) A ``correspondence address'' or change thereto may be filed with 
the Patent and Trademark Office during the enforceable life of the 
patent. The ``correspondence address'' will be used in any 
correspondence relating to maintenance fees unless a separate ``fee 
address'' has been specified. See Sec. 1.363 for ``fee address'' used 
solely for maintenance fee purposes.

Sec. 1.34  Recognition for representation.

    (a) When a registered attorney or agent acting in a representative 
capacity, pursuant to Sec. 1.31, appears in person or signs a paper in 
practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office in a 
patent case, his or her personal appearance or signature shall 
constitute a representation to the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office that under the provisions of this subchapter and the law, he or 
she is authorized to represent the particular party in whose behalf he 
or she acts. In filing such a paper, the registered attorney or agent 
should specify his or her registration number with his or her signature. 
Further proof of authority to act in a representative capacity may be 
required.
    (b) When a registered attorney or agent shall have filed his or her 
power of attorney, or authorization, duly executed by the person or 
persons entitled to prosecute an application or a patent involved in a 
reexamination proceeding, pursuant to Sec. 1.31, he or she is a 
principal registered attorney or agent of record in the case. A 
principal registered attorney or agent, so appointed, may appoint an 
associate registered attorney or agent who shall also then be of record.

Sec. 1.36  Revocation of power of attorney or authorization; withdrawal of registered attorney or agent.

    A power of attorney or authorization of agent, pursuant to 
Sec. 1.31, may be revoked at any stage in the proceedings of a case, and 
a registered attorney or agent may withdraw, upon application to and 
approval by the Commissioner. A registered attorney or agent, except an 
associate registered attorney or agent whose address is the same as that 
of the principal registered attorney or agent, will be notified of the 
revocation of the power of attorney or authorization, and the applicant 
or patent owner will be notified of the withdrawal of the registered 
attorney or agent. An assignment will not of itself operate as a 
revocation of a power or authorization previously given, but the 
assignee of the entire interest may revoke previous powers and be 
represented by a registered attorney or agent of the assignee's own 
selection. See Sec. 1.613(d) for withdrawal in an interference.

                       Who May Apply for a Patent


<R05>
Sec. 1.41  Applicant for patent.

    (a) A patent is applied for in the name or names of the actual 
inventor or inventors.
    (1) The inventorship of a nonprovisional application is that 
inventorship set forth in the oath or declaration as prescribed by 
Sec. 1.63, except as provided for in Secs. 1.53(d)(4) and 1.63(d). If an 
oath or declaration as prescribed by Sec. 1.63 is not filed during the 
pendency of a nonprovisional application, the inventorship is that 
inventorship set forth in the application papers filed pursuant to 
Sec. 1.53(b), unless applicant files a paper, including the processing 
fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(i), supplying or changing the name or names 
of the inventor or inventors.
    (2) The inventorship of a provisional application is that 
inventorship set forth in the cover sheet as prescribed by 
Sec. 1.51(c)(1). If a cover sheet as prescribed by Sec. 1.51(c)(1) is 
not filed during the pendency of a provisional application, the 
inventorship is that inventorship set forth in the application papers 
filed pursuant to Sec. 1.53(c), unless applicant files a paper including 
the processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(q), supplying or changing the 
name or names of the inventor or inventors.
    (3) In a nonprovisional application filed without an oath or 
declaration as

[[Page 39]]

prescribed by Sec. 1.63 or a provisional application filed without a 
cover sheet as prescribed by Sec. 1.51(c)(1), the name, residence, and 
citizenship of each person believed to be an actual inventor should be 
provided when the application papers pursuant to Sec. 1.53(b) or 
Sec. 1.53(c) are filed.
    (4) The inventorship of an international application entering the 
national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371 is that inventorship set forth in the 
international application, which includes any change effected under PCT 
Rule 92bis. See Sec. 1.497(d) and (f) for filing an oath or declaration 
naming an inventive entity different from the inventive entity named in 
the international application, or if a change to the inventive entity 
has been effected under PCT Rule 92bis subsequent to the execution of 
any declaration filed under PCT Rule 4.17(iv) (Sec. 1.48(f)(1) does not 
apply to an international application entering the national stage under 
35 U.S.C. 371).
    (b) Unless the contrary is indicated the word ``applicant'' when 
used in these sections refers to the inventor or joint inventors who are 
applying for a patent, or to the person mentioned in Secs. 1.42, 1.43, 
or 1.47 who is applying for a patent in place of the inventor.
    (c) Any person authorized by the applicant may physically or 
electronically deliver an application for patent to the Office on behalf 
of the inventor or inventors, but an oath or declaration for the 
application (Sec. 1.63) can only be made in accordance with Sec. 1.64.
    (d) A showing may be required from the person filing the application 
that the filing was authorized where such authorization comes into 
question.

Sec. 1.42  When the inventor is dead.

    In case of the death of the inventor, the legal representative

Sec. 1.45  Joint inventors.

    (a) Joint inventors must apply for a patent jointly and each must 
make the required oath or declaration: neither of them alone, nor less 
than the entire number, can apply for a patent for an invention invented 
by them jointly, except as provided in Sec. 1.47.
    (b) Inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though
    (1) They did not physically work together or at the same time,
    (2) Each inventor did not make the same type or amount of 
contribution, or
    (3) Each inventor did not make a contribution to the subject matter 
of every claim of the application.
    (c) If multiple inventors are named in a nonprovisional application, 
each named inventor must have made a contribution, individually or 
jointly, to the subject matter of at least one claim of the application 
and the application will be considered to be a joint application under 
35 U.S.C. 116. If multiple inventors are named in a provisional 
application, each named inventor must have made a contribution, 
individually or jointly, to the subject

Sec. 1.46  Assigned inventions and patents.

    In case the whole or a part interest in the invention or in the 
patent to be issued is assigned, the application must still be made or 
authorized to be made, and an oath or declaration signed, by the 
inventor or one of the persons mentioned in Sec. 1.42, 1.43, or 1.47. 
However, the patent may be issued to the assignee or jointly to the 
inventor and the assignee as provided in Sec. 3.81.

<R05>
Sec. 1.47  Filing when an inventor refuses to sign or cannot be reached.

    (a) If a joint inventor refuses to join in an application for patent 
or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, the application may 
be made by the other inventor on behalf of himself or herself and the 
nonsigning inventor. The oath or declaration in such an application must 
be accompanied by a petition including proof of the pertinent facts, the 
fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(h), and the last known address of the 
nonsigning inventor. The nonsigning inventor may subsequently join in 
the application by filing an oath or declaration complying with 
Sec. 1.63.
    (b) Whenever all of the inventors refuse to execute an application 
for patent, or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, a 
person to whom an inventor has assigned or agreed in writing to assign 
the invention, or who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in 
the matter justifying such action, may make application for patent on 
behalf of and as agent for all the inventors. The oath or declaration in 
such an application must be accompanied by a petition including proof of 
the pertinent facts, a showing that such action is necessary to preserve 
the rights of the parties or to prevent irreparable damage, the fee set 
forth in Sec. 1.17(h), and the last known address of all of the 
inventors. An inventor may subsequently join in the application by 
filing an oath or declaration complying with Sec. 1.63.
    (c) The Office will send notice of the filing of the application to 
all inventors who have not joined in the application at the address(es) 
provided in the petition under this section, and publish notice of the 
filing of the application in the Official Gazette. The Office may 
dispense with this notice provision in a continuation or divisional 
application, if notice regarding the filing of the prior application was 
given to the nonsigning inventor(s).

Sec. 1.48  Correction of inventorship in a patent application, other than a reissue application, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 116.

    (a) Nonprovisional application after oath/declaration filed. If the 
inventive entity is set forth in error in an executed Sec. 1.63 oath or 
declaration in a nonprovisional application, and such error arose 
without any deceptive intention on the part of the person named as an 
inventor in error or on the part of the person who through error was not 
named as an inventor, the inventorship of the nonprovisional application 
may be amended to name only the actual inventor or inventors. If the 
nonprovisional application is involved in an interference, the amendment 
must comply with the requirements of this section and must be 
accompanied by a motion under Sec. 1.634. Amendment of the inventorship 
requires:
    (1) A request to correct the inventorship that sets forth the 
desired inventorship change;
    (2) A statement from each person being added as an inventor and from 
each person being deleted as an inventor that the error in inventorship 
occurred without deceptive intention on his or her part;
    (3) An oath or declaration by the actual inventor or inventors as 
required by Sec. 1.63 or as permitted by Secs. 1.42, 1.43 or Sec. 1.47;
    (4) The processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(i); and

[[Page 41]]

    (5) If an assignment has been executed by any of the original named 
inventors, the written consent of the assignee (see Sec. 3.73(b) of this 
chapter).
    (b) Nonprovisional application--fewer inventors due to amendment or 
cancellation of claims. If the correct inventors are named in a 
nonprovisional application, and the prosecution of the nonprovisional 
application results in the amendment or cancellation of claims so that 
fewer than all of the currently named inventors are the actual inventors 
of the invention being claimed in the nonprovisional application, an 
amendment must be filed requesting deletion of the name or names of the 
person or persons who are not inventors of the invention being claimed. 
If the application is involved in an interference, the amendment must 
comply with the requirements of this section and must be accompanied by 
a motion under Sec. 1.634. Amendment of the inventorship requires:
    (1) A request, signed by a party set forth in Sec. 1.33(b), to 
correct the inventorship that identifies the named inventor or inventors 
being deleted and acknowledges that the inventor's invention is no 
longer being claimed in the nonprovisional application; and
    (2) The processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(i).
    (c) Nonprovisional application--inventors added for claims to 
previously unclaimed subject matter. If a nonprovisional application 
discloses unclaimed subject matter by an inventor or inventors not named 
in the application, the application may be amended to add claims to the 
subject matter and name the correct inventors for the application. If 
the application is involved in an interference, the amendment must 
comply with the requirements of this section and must be accompanied by 
a motion under Sec. 1.634. Amendment of the inventorship requires:
    (1) A request to correct the inventorship that sets forth the 
desired inventorship change;
    (2) A statement from each person being added as an inventor that the 
addition is necessitated by amendment of the claims and that the 
inventorship error occurred without deceptive intention on his or her 
part;
    (3) An oath or declaration by the actual inventors as required by 
Sec. 1.63 or as permitted by Secs. 1.42, 1.43, or Sec. 1.47;
    (4) The processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(i); and
    (5) If an assignment has been executed by any of the original named 
inventors, the written consent of the assignee (see Sec. 3.73(b) of this 
chapter).
    (d) Provisional application--adding omitted inventors. If the name 
or names of an inventor or inventors were omitted in a provisional 
application through error without any deceptive intention on the part of 
the omitted inventor or inventors, the provisional application may be 
amended to add the name or names of the omitted inventor or inventors. 
Amendment of the inventorship requires:
    (1) A request, signed by a party set forth in Sec. 1.33(b), to 
correct the inventorship that identifies the inventor or inventors being 
added and states that the inventorship error occurred without deceptive 
intention on the part of the omitted inventor or inventors; and
    (2) The processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(q).
    (e) Provisional application--deleting the name or names of the 
inventor or inventors. If a person or persons were named as an inventor 
or inventors in a provisional application through error without any 
deceptive intention on the part of such person or persons, an amendment 
may be filed in the provisional application deleting the name or names 
of the person or persons who were erroneously named. Amendment of the 
inventorship requires:
    (1) A request to correct the inventorship that sets forth the 
desired inventorship change;
    (2) A statement by the person or persons whose name or names are 
being deleted that the inventorship error occurred without deceptive 
intention on the part of such person or persons;
    (3) The processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(q); and
    (4) If an assignment has been executed by any of the original named 
inventors, the written consent of the assignee (see Sec. 3.73(b) of this 
chapter).
    (f)(1) Nonprovisional application--filing executed oath/declaration 
corrects inventorship. If the correct inventor or

[[Page 42]]

inventors are not named on filing a nonprovisional application under 
Sec. 1.53(b) without an executed oath or declaration under Sec. 1.63 by 
any of the inventors, the first submission of an executed oath or 
declaration under Sec. 1.63 by any of the inventors during the pendency 
of the application will act to correct the earlier identification of 
inventorship. See Secs. 1.41(a)(4) and 1.497(d) and (f) for submission 
of an executed oath or declaration to enter the national stage under 35 
U.S.C. 371 naming an inventive entity different from the inventive 
entity set forth in the international stage.
    (2) Provisional application--filing cover sheet corrects 
inventorship. If the correct inventor or inventors are not named on 
filing a provisional application without a cover sheet under 
Sec. 1.51(c)(1), the later submission of a cover sheet under 
Sec. 1.51(c)(1) during the pendency of the application will act to 
correct the earlier identification of inventorship.
    (g) Additional information may be required. The Office may require 
such other information as may be deemed appropriate under the particular 
circumstances surrounding the correction of inventorship.
    (h) Reissue applications not covered. The provisions of this section 
do not apply to reissue applications. See Secs. 1.171 and 1.175 for 
correction of inventorship in a patent via a reissue application.
    (i) Correction of inventorship in patent or interference. See 
Sec. 1.324 for correction of inventorship in a patent, and Sec. 1.634 
for correction of inventorship in an interference.

format as the specification in a reissue application or request for 
reexamination.
    (4) See Sec. 1.58 for chemical and mathematical formulae and tables, 
and Sec. 1.84 for drawings.
    (5) If papers that do not comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section are submitted as part of the permanent record, other than the 
drawings, applicant, or the patent owner, or the requester in a 
reexamination proceeding, will be notified and must provide substitute 
papers that comply with paragraph (a)(1) of this section within a set 
time period.
    (b) The application (specification, including the claims, drawings, 
and oath or declaration) or reexamination proceeding and any amendments 
or corrections to the application or reexamination proceeding. (1) The 
application or proceeding and any amendments or corrections to the 
application (including any translation submitted pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section) or proceeding, except as provided for in Sec. 1.69 
and paragraph (d) of this section, must:
    (i) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; 
and
    (ii) Be in the English language or be accompanied by a translation 
of the application and a translation of any corrections or amendments 
into the English language together with a statement that the translation 
is accurate.
    (2) The specification (including the abstract and claims) for other 
than reissue applications and reexamination proceedings, and any 
amendments for applications (including reissue applications) and 
reexamination proceedings to the specification, except as provided for 
in Secs. 1.821 through 1.825, must have:
    (i) Lines that are 1\1/2\ or double spaced;
    (ii) Text written in a nonscript type font (e.g., Arial, Times 
Roman, or Courier) lettering style having capital letters which are at 
least 0.21 cm (0.08 inch) high; and
    (iii) Only a single column of text.
    (3) The claim or claims must commence on a separate sheet 
(Sec. 1.75(h)).
    (4) The abstract must commence on a separate sheet or be submitted 
as the first page of the patent in a reissue application or 
reexamination proceeding (Sec. 1.72(b)).
    (5) Other than in a reissue application or reexamination proceeding, 
the pages of the specification including claims and abstract must be 
numbered consecutively, starting with 1, the numbers being centrally 
located above or preferably, below, the text.
    (6) Other than in a reissue application or reexamination proceeding, 
the paragraphs of the specification, other than in the claims or 
abstract, may be numbered at the time the application is filed, and 
should be individually and consecutively numbered using Arabic numerals, 
so as to unambiguously identify each paragraph. The number should 
consist of at least four numerals enclosed in square brackets, including 
leading zeros (e.g., [0001]). The numbers and enclosing brackets should 
appear to the right of the left margin as the first item in each 
paragraph, before the first word of the paragraph, and should be 
highlighted in bold. A gap, equivalent to approximately four spaces, 
should follow the number. Nontext elements (e.g., tables, mathematical 
or

[[Page 44]]

chemical formulae, chemical structures, and sequence data) are 
considered part of the numbered paragraph around or above the elements, 
and should not be independently numbered. If a nontext element extends 
to the left margin, it should not be numbered as a separate and 
independent paragraph. A list is also treated as part of the paragraph 
around or above the list, and should not be independently numbered. 
Paragraph or section headers (titles), whether abutting the left margin 
or centered on the page, are not considered paragraphs and should not be 
numbered.
    (7) If papers that do not comply with paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(5) of this section are submitted as part of the application, 
applicant, or patent owner, or requester in a reexamination proceeding, 
will be notified and the applicant, patent owner or requester in a 
reexamination proceeding must provide substitute papers that comply with 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section within a set time 
period.
    (c)(1) Any interlineation, erasure, cancellation or other alteration 
of the application papers filed must be made before the signing of any 
accompanying oath or declaration pursuant to Sec. 1.63 referring to 
those application papers and should be dated and initialed or signed by 
the applicant on the same sheet of paper. Application papers containing 
alterations made after the signing of an oath or declaration referring 
to those application papers must be supported by a supplemental oath or 
declaration under Sec. 1.67. In either situation, a substitute 
specification (Sec. 1.125) is required if the application papers do not 
comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
    (2) After the signing of the oath or declaration referring to the 
application papers, amendments may only be made in the manner provided 
by Sec. 1.121.
    (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, if an oath or 
declaration is a copy of the oath or declaration from a prior 
application, the application for which such copy is submitted may 
contain alterations that do not introduce matter that would have been 
new matter in the prior application.
    (d) A nonprovisional or provisional application may be filed in a 
language other than English.
    (1) Nonprovisional application. If a nonprovisional application is 
filed in a language other than English, an English language translation 
of the non-English language application, a statement that the 
translation is accurate, and the processing fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(i) are required. If these items are not filed with the 
application, applicant will be notified and given a period of time 
within which they must be filed in order to avoid abandonment.
    (2) Provisional application. If a provisional application is filed 
in a language other than English, an English language translation of the 
non-English language provisional application will not be required in the 
provisional application. See Sec. 1.78(a) for the requirements for 
claiming the benefit of such provisional application in a nonprovisional 
application.
    (e) Electronic documents that are to become part of the permanent 
United States Patent and Trademark Office records in the file of a 
patent application or reexamination proceeding. (1) The following 
documents may be submitted to the Office on a compact disc in compliance 
with this paragraph:
    (i) A computer program listing (see Sec. 1.96);
    (ii) A ``Sequence Listing'' (submitted under Sec. 1.821(c)); or
    (iii) A table (see Sec. 1.58) that has more than 50 pages of text.
    (2) A compact disc as used in this part means a Compact Disc-Read 
Only Memory (CD-ROM) or a Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R) in compliance 
with this paragraph. A CD-ROM is a ``read-only'' medium on which the 
data is pressed into the disc so that it cannot be changed or erased. A 
CD-R is a ``write once'' medium on which once the data is recorded, it 
is permanent and cannot be changed or erased.
    (3)(i) Each compact disc must conform to the International Standards 
Organization (ISO) 9660 standard, and the contents of each compact disc 
must be in compliance with the American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII).
    (ii) Each compact disc must be enclosed in a hard compact disc case

[[Page 45]]

within an unsealed padded and protective mailing envelope and 
accompanied by a transmittal letter on paper in accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section. The transmittal letter must list for each 
compact disc the machine format (e.g., IBM-PC, Macintosh), the operating 
system compatibility (e.g., MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Macintosh, Unix), a list 
of files contained on the compact disc including their names, sizes in 
bytes, and dates of creation, plus any other special information that is 
necessary to identify, maintain, and interpret the information on the 
compact disc. Compact discs submitted to the Office will not be returned 
to the applicant.
    (4) Any compact disc must be submitted in duplicate unless it 
contains only the ``Sequence Listing'' in computer readable form 
required by Sec. 1.821(e). The compact disc and duplicate copy must be 
labeled ``Copy 1'' and ``Copy 2,'' respectively. The transmittal letter 
which accompanies the compact disc must include a statement that the two 
compact discs are identical. In the event that the two compact discs are 
not identical, the Office will use the compact disc labeled ``Copy 1'' 
for further processing. Any amendment to the information on a compact 
disc must be by way of a replacement compact disc in compliance with 
this paragraph containing the substitute information, and must be 
accompanied by a statement that the replacement compact disc contains no 
new matter. The compact disc and copy must be labeled ``COPY 1 
REPLACEMENT MM/DD/YYYY'' (with the month, day and year of creation 
indicated), and ``COPY 2 REPLACEMENT MM/DD/YYYY,'' respectively.
    (5) The specification must contain an incorporation-by-reference of 
the material on the compact disc in a separate paragraph 
(Sec. 1.77(b)(4)), identifying each compact disc by the names of the 
files contained on each of the compact discs, their date of creation and 
their sizes in bytes. The Office may require applicant to amend the 
specification to include in the paper portion any part of the 
specification previously submitted on compact disc.
    (6) A compact disc must also be labeled with the following 
information:
    (i) The name of each inventor (if known);
    (ii) Title of the invention;
    (iii) The docket number, or application number if known, used by the 
person filing the application to identify the application; and
    (iv) A creation date of the compact disc.
    (v) If multiple compact discs are submitted, the label shall 
indicate their order (e.g. ``1 of X'').
    (vi) An indication that the disk is ``Copy 1'' or ``Copy 2'' of the 
submission. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (7) If a file is unreadable on both copies of the disc, the 
unreadable file will be treated as not having been submitted. A file is 
unreadable if, for example, it is of a format that does not comply with 
the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, it is corrupted by 
a computer virus, or it is written onto a defective compact disc.

<R05>
Sec. 1.53  Application number, filing date, and completion of application.

    (a) Application number. Any papers received in the Patent and 
Trademark Office which purport to be an application for a patent will be 
assigned an application number for identification purposes.
    (b) Application filing requirements--Nonprovisional application. The 
filing date of an application for patent filed under this section, 
except for a provisional application under paragraph (c) of this section 
or a continued prosecution application under paragraph (d) of this 
section, is the date on which a specification as prescribed by 35 U.S.C. 
112 containing a description pursuant to Sec. 1.71 and at least one 
claim pursuant to Sec. 1.75, and any drawing required by Sec. 1.81(a) 
are filed in the Patent and Trademark Office. No new matter may be 
introduced into an application after

[[Page 46]]

its filing date. A continuing application, which may be a continuation, 
divisional, or continuation-in-part application, may be filed under the 
conditions specified in 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c) and Sec. 1.78(a).
    (1) A continuation or divisional application that names as inventors 
the same or fewer than all of the inventors named in the prior 
application may be filed under this paragraph or paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) A continuation-in-part application (which may disclose and claim 
subject matter not disclosed in the prior application) or a continuation 
or divisional application naming an inventor not named in the prior 
application must be filed under this paragraph.
    (c) Application filing requirements--Provisional application. The 
filing date of a provisional application is the date on which a 
specification as prescribed by the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112, and 
any drawing required by Sec. 1.81(a) are filed in the Patent and 
Trademark Office. No amendment, other than to make the provisional 
application comply with the patent statute and all applicable 
regulations, may be made to the provisional application after the filing 
date of the provisional application.
    (1) A provisional application must also include the cover sheet 
required by Sec. 1.51(c)(1), which may be an application data sheet 
(Sec. 1.76), or a cover letter identifying the application as a 
provisional application. Otherwise, the application will be treated as 
an application filed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2) An application for patent filed under paragraph (b) of this 
section may be converted to a provisional application and be accorded 
the original filing date of the application filed under paragraph (b) of 
this section. The grant of such a request for conversion will not 
entitle applicant to a refund of the fees that were properly paid in the 
application filed under paragraph (b) of this section. Such a request 
for conversion must be accompanied by the processing fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(q) and be filed prior to the earliest of:
    (i) Abandonment of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this 
section;
    (ii) Payment of the issue fee on the application filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section;
    (iii) Expiration of twelve months after the filing date of the 
application filed under paragraph (b) of this section; or
    (iv) The filing of a request for a statutory invention registration 
under Sec. 1.293 in the application filed under paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (3) A provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this 
section may be converted to a nonprovisional application filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section and accorded the original filing date of 
the provisional application. The conversion of a provisional application 
to a nonprovisional application will not result in either the refund of 
any fee properly paid in the provisional application or the application 
of any such fee to the filing fee, or any other fee, for the 
nonprovisional application. Conversion of a provisional application to a 
nonprovisional application under this paragraph will result in the term 
of any patent to issue from the application being measured from at least 
the filing date of the provisional application for which conversion is 
requested. Thus, applicants should consider avoiding this adverse patent 
term impact by filing a nonprovisional application claiming the benefit 
of the provisional application under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) (rather than 
converting the provisional application into a nonprovisional application 
pursuant to this paragraph). A request to convert a provisional 
application to a nonprovisional application must be accompanied by the 
fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(i) and an amendment including at least one 
claim as prescribed by the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112, unless the 
provisional application under paragraph (c) of this section otherwise 
contains at least one claim as prescribed by the second paragraph of 35 
U.S.C. 112. The nonprovisional application resulting from conversion of 
a provisional application must also include the filing fee for a 
nonprovisional application, an oath or declaration by the applicant 
pursuant to Secs. 1.63, 1.162, or 1.175, and the surcharge required by

[[Page 47]]

Sec. 1.16(e) if either the basic filing fee for a nonprovisional 
application or the oath or declaration was not present on the filing 
date accorded the resulting nonprovisional application (i.e., the filing 
date of the original provisional application). A request to convert a 
provisional application to a nonprovisional application must also be 
filed prior to the earliest of:
    (i) Abandonment of the provisional application filed under paragraph 
(c) of this section; or
    (ii) Expiration of twelve months after the filing date of the 
provisional application filed under this paragraph (c).
    (4) A provisional application is not entitled to the right of 
priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 or 365(a) or Sec. 1.55, or to the benefit 
of an earlier filing date under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c) or 
Sec. 1.78 of any other application. No claim for priority under 35 
U.S.C. 119(e) or Sec. 1.78(a)(4) may be made in a design application 
based on a provisional application. No request under Sec. 1.293 for a 
statutory invention registration may be filed in a provisional 
application. The requirements of Secs. 1.821 through 1.825 regarding 
application disclosures containing nucleotide and/or amino acid 
sequences are not mandatory for provisional applications.
    (d) Application filing requirements--Continued prosecution 
(nonprovisional) application. (1) A continuation or divisional 
application (but not a continuation-in-part) of a prior nonprovisional 
application may be filed as a continued prosecution application under 
this paragraph, provided that:
    (i) The prior nonprovisional application is:
    (A) A utility or plant application that was filed under 35 U.S.C. 
111(a) before May 29, 2000, and is complete as defined by Sec. 1.51(b);
    (B) A design application that is complete as defined by 
Sec. 1.51(b); or
    (C) The national stage of an international application that was 
filed under 35 U.S.C. 363 before May 29, 2000, and is in compliance with 
35 U.S.C. 371; and
    (ii) The application under this paragraph is filed before the 
earliest of:
    (A) Payment of the issue fee on the prior application, unless a 
petition under Sec. 1.313(c) is granted in the prior application;
    (B) Abandonment of the prior application; or
    (C) Termination of proceedings on the prior application.
    (2) The filing date of a continued prosecution application is the 
date on which a request on a separate paper for an application under 
this paragraph is filed. An application filed under this paragraph:
    (i) Must identify the prior application;
    (ii) Discloses and claims only subject matter disclosed in the prior 
application;
    (iii) Names as inventors the same inventors named in the prior 
application on the date the application under this paragraph was filed, 
except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
    (iv) Includes the request for an application under this paragraph, 
will utilize the file jacket and contents of the prior application, 
including the specification, drawings and oath or declaration from the 
prior application, to constitute the new application, and will be 
assigned the application number of the prior application for 
identification purposes; and
    (v) Is a request to expressly abandon the prior application as of 
the filing date of the request for an application under this paragraph.
    (3) The filing fee for a continued prosecution application filed 
under this paragraph is:
    (i) The basic filing fee as set forth in Sec. 1.16; and
    (ii) Any additional Sec. 1.16 fee due based on the number of claims 
remaining in the application after entry of any amendment accompanying 
the request for an application under this paragraph and entry of any 
amendments under Sec. 1.116 unentered in the prior application which 
applicant has requested to be entered in the continued prosecution 
application.
    (4) An application filed under this paragraph may be filed by fewer 
than all the inventors named in the prior application, provided that the 
request for an application under this paragraph when filed is 
accompanied by a statement requesting deletion of the name or names of 
the person or persons who

[[Page 48]]

are not inventors of the invention being claimed in the new application. 
No person may be named as an inventor in an application filed under this 
paragraph who was not named as an inventor in the prior application on 
the date the application under this paragraph was filed, except by way 
of correction of inventorship under Sec. 1.48.
    (5) Any new change must be made in the form of an amendment to the 
prior application as it existed prior to the filing of an application 
under this paragraph. No amendment in an application under this 
paragraph (a continued prosecution application) may introduce new matter 
or matter that would have been new matter in the prior application. Any 
new specification filed with the request for an application under this 
paragraph will not be considered part of the original application 
papers, but will be treated as a substitute specification in accordance 
with Sec. 1.125.
    (6) The filing of a continued prosecution application under this 
paragraph will be construed to include a waiver of confidentiality by 
the applicant under 35 U.S.C. 122 to the extent that any member of the 
public, who is entitled under the provisions of Sec. 1.14 to access to, 
copies of, or information concerning either the prior application or any 
continuing application filed under the provisions of this paragraph, may 
be given similar access to, copies of, or similar information concerning 
the other application or applications in the file jacket.
    (7) A request for an application under this paragraph is the 
specific reference required by 35 U.S.C. 120 to every application 
assigned the application number identified in such request. No amendment 
in an application under this paragraph may delete this specific 
reference to any prior application.
    (8) In addition to identifying the application number of the prior 
application, applicant should furnish in the request for an application 
under this paragraph the following information relating to the prior 
application to the best of his or her ability:
    (i) Title of invention;
    (ii) Name of applicant(s); and
    (iii) Correspondence address.
    (9) Envelopes containing only requests and fees for filing an 
application under this paragraph should be marked ``Box CPA.'' Requests 
for an application under this paragraph filed by facsimile transmission 
should be clearly marked ``Box CPA.''
    (10) See Sec. 1.103(b) for requesting a limited suspension of action 
in an application filed under this paragraph.
    (e) Failure to meet filing date requirements. (1) If an application 
deposited under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section does not meet 
the requirements of such paragraph to be entitled to a filing date, 
applicant will be so notified, if a correspondence address has been 
provided, and given a time period within which to correct the filing 
error.
    (2) Any request for review of a notification pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, or a notification that the original application 
papers lack a portion of the specification or drawing(s), must be by way 
of a petition pursuant to this paragraph accompanied by the fee set 
forth in Sec. 1.17(h). In the absence of a timely (Sec. 1.181(f)) 
petition pursuant to this paragraph, the filing date of an application 
in which the applicant was notified of a filing error pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be the date the filing error is 
corrected.
    (3) If an applicant is notified of a filing error pursuant to 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but fails to correct the filing error 
within the given time period or otherwise timely (Sec. 1.181(f)) take 
action pursuant to this paragraph, proceedings in the application will 
be considered terminated. Where proceedings in an application are 
terminated pursuant to this paragraph, the application may be disposed 
of, and any filing fees, less the handling fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.21(n), will be refunded.
    (f) Completion of application subsequent to filing--Nonprovisional 
(including continued prosecution or reissue) application. (1) If an 
application which has been accorded a filing date pursuant to paragraph 
(b) or (d) of this section does not include the basic filing fee, or if 
an application which has been accorded a filing date pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section does not include an oath or declaration by 
the applicant pursuant to Secs. 1.63, 1.162 or Sec. 1.175, and applicant 
has provided a correspondence address (Sec. 1.33(a)), applicant will be 
notified and

[[Page 49]]

given a period of time within which to pay the filing fee, file an oath 
or declaration in an application under paragraph (b) of this section, 
and pay the surcharge required by Sec. 1.16(e) to avoid abandonment.
    (2) If an application which has been accorded a filing date pursuant 
to paragraph (b) of this section does not include the basic filing fee 
or an oath or declaration by the applicant pursuant to Secs. 1.63, 1.162 
or Sec. 1.175, and applicant has not provided a correspondence address 
(Sec. 1.33(a)), applicant has two months from the filing date of the 
application within which to pay the basic filing fee, file an oath or 
declaration, and pay the surcharge required by Sec. 1.16(e) to avoid 
abandonment.
    (3) This paragraph applies to continuation or divisional 
applications under paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section and to 
continuation-in-part applications under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (4) See Sec. 1.63(d) concerning the submission of a copy of the oath 
or declaration from the prior application for a continuation or 
divisional application under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (5) If applicant does not pay one of the basic filing or the 
processing and retention fees (Sec. 1.21(l)) during the pendency of the 
application, the Office may dispose of the application.
    (g) Completion of application subsequent to filing--provisional 
application. (1) If a provisional application which has been accorded a 
filing date pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section does not include 
the cover sheet required by Sec. 1.51(c)(1) or the basic filing fee 
(Sec. 1.16(k)), and applicant has provided a correspondence address 
(Sec. 1.33(a)), applicant will be notified and given a period of time 
within which to pay the basic filing fee, file a cover sheet 
(Sec. 1.51(c)(1)), and pay the surcharge required by Sec. 1.16(l) to 
avoid abandonment.
    (2) If a provisional application which has been accorded a filing 
date pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section does not include the 
cover sheet required by Sec. 1.51(c)(1) or the basic filing fee 
(Sec. 1.16(k)), and applicant has not provided a correspondence address 
(Sec. 1.33(a)), applicant has two months from the filing date of the 
application within which to pay the basic filing fee, file a cover sheet 
(Sec. 1.51(c)(1)), and pay the surcharge required by Sec. 1.16(l) to 
avoid abandonment.
    (3) If applicant does not pay the basic filing fee during the 
pendency of the application, the Office may dispose of the application.
    (h) Subsequent treatment of application--Nonprovisional (including 
continued prosecution) application. An application for a patent filed 
under paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section will not be placed on the 
files for examination until all its required parts, complying with the 
rules relating thereto, are received, except that certain minor 
informalities may be waived subject to subsequent correction whenever 
required.
    (i) Subsequent treatment of application--Provisional application. A 
provisional application for a patent filed under paragraph (c) of this 
section will not be placed on the files for examination and will become 
abandoned no later than twelve months after its filing date pursuant to 
35 U.S.C. 111(b)(1).
    (j) Filing date of international application. The filing date of an 
international application designating the United States of America is 
treated as the filing date in the United States of America under PCT 
Article 11(3), except as provided in 35 U.S.C. 102(e).

<R05>
Sec. 1.54  Parts of application to be filed together; filing receipt.

    (a) It is desirable that all parts of the complete application be 
deposited in the Office together; otherwise, a letter must accompany 
each part, accurately and clearly connecting it with the other parts of 
the application. See Sec. 1.53 (f) and (g) with regard to completion of 
an application.

Sec. 1.55  Claim for foreign priority.

    (a) An applicant in a nonprovisional application may claim the 
benefit of

[[Page 50]]

the filing date of one or more prior foreign applications under the 
conditions specified in 35 U.S.C. 119(a) through (d) and (f), 172, and 
365(a) and (b).
    (1)(i) In an original application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a), the 
claim for priority must be presented during the pendency of the 
application, and within the later of four months from the actual filing 
date of the application or sixteen months from the filing date of the 
prior foreign application. This time period is not extendable. The claim 
must identify the foreign application for which priority is claimed, as 
well as any foreign application for the same subject matter and having a 
filing date before that of the application for which priority is 
claimed, by specifying the application number, country (or intellectual 
property authority), day, month, and year of its filing. The time 
periods in this paragraph do not apply in an application under 35 U.S.C. 
111(a) if the application is:
    (A) A design application; or
    (B) An application filed before November 29, 2000.
    (ii) In an application that entered the national stage from an 
international application after compliance with 35 U.S.C. 371, the claim 
for priority must be made during the pendency of the application and 
within the time limit set forth in the PCT and the Regulations under the 
PCT.
    (2) The claim for priority and the certified copy of the foreign 
application specified in 35 U.S.C. 119(b) or PCT Rule 17 must, in any 
event, be filed before the patent is granted. If the claim for priority 
or the certified copy of the foreign application is filed after the date 
the issue fee is paid, it must be accompanied by the processing fee set 
forth in Sec. 1.17(i), but the patent will not include the priority 
claim unless corrected by a certificate of correction under 35 U.S.C. 
255 and Sec. 1.323.
    (3) When the application becomes involved in an interference 
(Sec. 1.630), when necessary to overcome the date of a reference relied 
upon by the examiner, or when deemed necessary by the examiner, the 
Office may require that the claim for priority and the certified copy of 
the foreign application be filed earlier than provided in paragraphs 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section.
    (4) An English language translation of a non-English language 
foreign application is not required except when the application is 
involved in an interference (Sec. 1.630), when necessary to overcome the 
date of a reference relied upon by the examiner, or when specifically 
required by the examiner. If an English language translation is 
required, it must be filed together with a statement that the 
translation of the certified copy is accurate.
    (b) An applicant in a nonprovisional application may under certain 
circumstances claim priority on the basis of one or more applications 
for an inventor's certificate in a country granting both inventor's 
certificates and patents. To claim the right of priority on the basis of 
an application for an inventor's certificate in such a country under 35 
U.S.C. 119(d), the applicant when submitting a claim for such right as 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, shall include an affidavit 
or declaration. The affidavit or declaration must include a specific 
statement that, upon an investigation, he or she is satisfied that to 
the best of his or her knowledge, the applicant, when filing the 
application for the inventor's certificate, had the option to file an 
application for either a patent or an inventor's certificate as to the 
subject matter of the identified claim or claims forming the basis for 
the claim of priority.
    (c) Unless such claim is accepted in accordance with the provisions 
of this paragraph, any claim for priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) or 
365(a) not presented within the time period provided by paragraph (a) of 
this section is considered to have been waived. If a claim for priority 
under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) or 365(a) is presented after the time period 
provided by paragraph (a) of this section, the claim may be accepted if 
the claim identifying the prior foreign application by specifying its 
application number, country (or intellectual property authority), and 
the day, month, and year of its filing was unintentionally delayed. A 
petition to accept a delayed claim for priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-
(d) or 365(a) must be accompanied by:
    (1) The claim under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) or 365(a) and this section 
to the

[[Page 51]]

prior foreign application, unless previously submitted;
    (2) The surcharge set forth in Sec. 1.17(t); and
    (3) A statement that the entire delay between the date the claim was 
due under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the date the claim was 
filed was unintentional. The Commissioner may require additional 
information where there is a question whether the delay was 
unintentional.

<R05>
Sec. 1.56  Duty to disclose information material to patentability.

    (a) A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. 
The public interest is best served, and the most effective patent 
examination occurs when, at the time an application is being examined, 
the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information 
material to patentability. Each individual associated with the filing 
and prosecution of a patent application has a duty of candor and good 
faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to 
the Office all information known to that individual to be material to 
patentability as defined in this section. The duty to disclose 
information exists with respect to each pending claim until the claim is 
cancelled or withdrawn from consideration, or the application becomes 
abandoned. Information material to the patentability of a claim that is 
cancelled or withdrawn from consideration need not be submitted if the 
information is not material to the patentability of any claim remaining 
under consideration in the application. There is no duty to submit 
information which is not material to the patentability of any existing 
claim. The duty to disclose all information known to be material to 
patentability is deemed to be satisfied if all information known to be 
material to patentability of any claim issued in a patent was cited by 
the Office or submitted to the Office in the manner prescribed by 
Secs. 1.97(b)-(d) and 1.98. However, no patent will be granted on an 
application in connection with which fraud on the Office was practiced 
or attempted or the duty of disclosure was violated through bad faith or 
intentional misconduct. The Office encourages applicants to carefully 
examine:
    (1) Prior art cited in search reports of a foreign patent office in 
a counterpart application, and
    (2) The closest information over which individuals associated with 
the filing or prosecution of a patent application believe any pending 
claim patentably defines, to make sure that any material information 
contained therein is disclosed to the Office.
    (b) Under this section, information is material to patentability 
when it is not cumulative to information already of record or being made 
of record in the application, and
    (1) It establishes, by itself or in combination with other 
information, a prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim; or
    (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant 
takes in:
    (i) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, 
or
    (ii) Asserting an argument of patentability.

A prima facie case of unpatentability is established when the 
information compels a conclusion that a claim is unpatentable under the 
preponderance of evidence, burden-of-proof standard, giving each term in 
the claim its broadest reasonable construction consistent with the 
specification, and before any consideration is given to evidence which 
may be submitted in an attempt to establish a contrary conclusion of 
patentability.
    (c) Individuals associated with the filing or prosecution of a 
patent application within the meaning of this section are:
    (1) Each inventor named in the application;
    (2) Each attorney or agent who prepares or prosecutes the 
application; and
    (3) Every other person who is substantively involved in the 
preparation or prosecution of the application and who is associated with 
the inventor, with the assignee or with anyone to whom there is an 
obligation to assign the application.

[[Page 52]]

    (d) Individuals other than the attorney, agent or inventor may 
comply with this section by disclosing information to the attorney, 
agent, or inventor.
    (e) In any continuation-in-part application, the duty under this 
section includes the duty to disclose to the Office all information 
known to the person to be material to patentability, as defined in 
paragraph (b) of this section, which became available between the filing 
date of the prior application and the national or PCT international 
filing date of the continuation-in-part application.

<R05>
Sec. 1.58  Chemical and mathematical formulae and tables.

    (a) The specification, including the claims, may contain chemical 
and mathematical formulas, but shall not contain drawings or flow 
diagrams. The description portion of the specification may contain 
tables; claims may contain tables either if necessary to conform to 35 
U.S.C. 112 or if otherwise found to be desirable.
    (b) Tables that are submitted in electronic form (Secs. 1.96(c) and 
1.821(c)) must maintain the spatial relationships (e.g., columns and 
rows) of the table elements and preserve the information they convey. 
Chemical and mathematical formulae must be encoded to maintain the 
proper positioning of their characters when displayed in order to 
preserve their intended meaning.
    (c) Chemical and mathematical formulae and tables must be presented 
in compliance with Sec. 1.52 (a) and (b), except that chemical and 
mathematical formulae or tables may be placed in a landscape orientation 
if they cannot be presented satisfactorily in a portrait orientation. 
Typewritten characters used in such formulae and tables must be chosen 
from a block (nonscript) type font or lettering style having capital 
letters which are at least 0.21 cm. (0.08 inch) high (e.g., elite type). 
A space at least 0.64 cm. (\1/4\ inch) high should be provided between 
complex formulae and tables and the text. Tables should have the lines 
and columns of data closely spaced to conserve space, consistent with a 
high degree of legibility.

Sec. 1.59  Expungement of information or copy of papers in application file.

    (a)(1) Information in an application will not be expunged and 
returned, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. See 
Sec. 1.618 for return of unauthorized and improper papers in 
interferences.
    (2) Information forming part of the original disclosure (i.e., 
written specification including the claims, drawings, and any 
preliminary amendment specifically incorporated into an executed oath or 
declaration under Secs. 1.63 and 1.175) will not be expunged from the 
application file.
    (b) An applicant may request that the Office expunge and return 
information, other than what is excluded by paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, by filing a petition under this paragraph. Any petition to 
expunge and return information from an application must include the fee 
set forth in Sec. 1.17(h) and establish to the satisfaction of the 
Commissioner that the return of the information is appropriate.
    (c) Upon request by an applicant and payment of the fee specified in 
Sec. 1.19(b), the Office will furnish copies of an application, unless 
the application has been disposed of (see Sec. 1.53 (e), (f) and (g)). 
The Office cannot provide or certify copies of an application that has 
been disposed of.

country, day, month, and year of its filing.
    (d)(1) A newly executed oath or declaration is not required under 
Sec. 1.51(b)(2) and Sec. 1.53(f) in a continuation or divisional 
application, provided that:
    (i) The prior nonprovisional application contained an oath or 
declaration as prescribed by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section;
    (ii) The continuation or divisional application was filed by all or 
by fewer than all of the inventors named in the prior application;

signed, is submitted for the continuation or divisional application.
    (2) The copy of the executed oath or declaration submitted under 
this paragraph for a continuation or divisional application must be 
accompanied by a statement requesting the deletion of the name or names 
of the person or persons who are not inventors in the continuation or 
divisional application.
    (3) Where the executed oath or declaration of which a copy is

of the executed oath or declaration for such prior application must be 
accompanied by:
    (i) A copy of the decision granting a petition to accord Sec. 1.47 
status to the prior application, unless all inventors or legal 
representatives have filed an oath or declaration to join in an 
application accorded status under Sec. 1.47 of which the continuation or 
divisional application claims a benefit under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 
365(c); and
    (ii) If one or more inventor(s) or legal representative(s) who 
refused to join in the prior application or could not be found or 
reached has subsequently joined in the prior application or another 
application of which the continuation or divisional application claims a 
benefit under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c), a copy of the subsequently 
executed oath(s) or declaration(s) filed by the inventor or legal 
representative to join in the application.
    (4) Where the power of attorney (or authorization of agent) or 
correspondence address was changed during the prosecution of the prior 
application,

[[Page 54]]

the change in power of attorney (or authorization of agent) or

Sec. 1.66  Officers authorized to administer oaths.

    (a) The oath or affirmation may be made before any person within the 
United States authorized by law to administer oaths. An oath made in a 
foreign country may be made before any diplomatic or consular officer of 
the United States authorized to administer oaths, or before any officer 
having an official seal and authorized to administer oaths in the 
foreign country in which the applicant may be, whose authority shall be 
proved by a certificate of a diplomatic or consular officer of the 
United States, or by an apostille of an official designated by a foreign 
country which, by treaty or convention, accords like effect to 
apostilles of designated officials in the United States. The oath shall 
be attested in all cases in this and other countries, by the proper 
official seal of the officer before whom the oath or affirmation is 
made. Such oath or affirmation shall be valid as to execution if it 
complies with the laws of the State or country where made. When the 
person before whom the oath or affirmation is made in this country is 
not provided with a seal, his official character shall be established by 
competent evidence, as by a certificate from a clerk of a court of 
record or other proper officer having a seal.
    (b) When the oath is taken before an officer in a country foreign to 
the United States, any accompanying application papers, except the 
drawings, must be attached together with the oath and a ribbon passed 
one or more times through all the sheets of the application, except the 
drawings, and the ends of said ribbon brought together under the seal 
before the latter is affixed and impressed, or each sheet must be 
impressed with the official seal of the officer before whom the oath is 
taken. If the papers as filed are not properly ribboned or each sheet 
impressed with the seal, the case will be accepted for examination, but 
before it is allowed, duplicate papers, prepared in compliance with the 
foregoing sentence, must be filed.

present in the earlier filed oath or declaration.
    (1) Deficiencies or inaccuracies relating to all the inventors or 
applicants (Secs. 1.42, 1.43, or Sec. 1.47) may be corrected with a 
supplemental oath or declaration signed by all the inventors or 
applicants.
    (2) Deficiencies or inaccuracies relating to fewer than all of the 
inventor(s) or applicant(s) (Secs. 1.42, 1.43 or Sec. 1.47) may be 
corrected with a supplemental oath or declaration identifying the entire 
inventive entity but signed only by the inventor(s) or applicant(s) to 
whom the error or deficiency relates.
    (3) Deficiencies or inaccuracies due to the failure to meet the 
requirements of Sec. 1.63(c) (e.g., to correct the omission of a mailing 
address of an inventor) in an oath or declaration may be corrected with 
an application data sheet in accordance with Sec. 1.76.
    (4) Submission of a supplemental oath or declaration or an 
application data sheet (Sec. 1.76), as opposed to who must sign the 
supplemental oath or declaration or an application data sheet, is 
governed by Sec. 1.33(a)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) A supplemental oath or declaration meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 1.63 must be filed when a claim is presented for matter originally 
shown or described but not substantially embraced in the statement of 
invention or claims originally presented or when an oath or declaration 
submitted in accordance with Sec. 1.53(f) after the filing of the 
specification and any required drawings specifically and improperly 
refers to an amendment which includes new matter. No new matter may be 
introduced into a nonprovisional application after its filing date even 
if a supplemental oath or declaration is filed. In proper situations, 
the oath or declaration here required may be made on information and 
belief by an applicant other than the inventor.

<R05>
Sec. 1.71  Detailed description and specification of the invention.

    (a) The specification must include a written description of the 
invention or discovery and of the manner and process of making and using 
the same, and is required to be in such full, clear, concise, and exact 
terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which the 
invention or discovery appertains, or with which it is most nearly 
connected, to make and use the same.
    (b) The specification must set forth the precise invention for which 
a patent is solicited, in such manner as to distinguish it from other 
inventions and from what is old. It must describe completely a specific 
embodiment of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter 
or improvement invented, and must explain the mode of operation or 
principle whenever applicable. The best mode contemplated by the 
inventor of carrying out his invention must be set forth.
    (c) In the case of an improvement, the specification must 
particularly point out the part or parts of the process, machine, 
manufacture, or composition of matter to which the improvement relates, 
and the description should be confined to the specific improvement and 
to such parts as necessarily cooperate with it or as may be necessary to 
a complete understanding or description of it.
    (d) A copyright or mask work notice may be placed in a design or 
utility patent application adjacent to copyright and mask work material 
contained therein. The notice may appear at any appropriate portion of 
the patent application disclosure. For notices in drawings, see 
Sec. 1.84(s). The content of the notice must be limited to only those 
elements provided for by law. For example, ``<SUP>[copy]</SUP>1983 John 
Doe'' (17 U.S.C. 401) and `` *M* John Doe'' (17 U.S.C. 909) would be 
properly limited and, under current statutes, legally sufficient notices 
of copyright and mask work, respectively. Inclusion of a copyright or 
mask work notice will be permitted only if the authorization language 
set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is included at the beginning 
(preferably as the first paragraph) of the specification.
    (e) The authorization shall read as follows:

    A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains 
material which is subject to (copyright or mask work) protection. The 
(copyright or mask work) owner has no objection to the facsimile

Sec. 1.72  Title and abstract.

    (a) The title of the invention may not exceed 500 characters in 
length and must be as short and specific as possible. Characters that 
cannot be captured and recorded in the Office's automated information 
systems may not be reflected in the Office's records in such systems or 
in documents created by the Office. Unless the title is supplied in an 
application data sheet (Sec. 1.76), the title of the invention should 
appear as a heading on the first page of the specification.
    (b) A brief abstract of the technical disclosure in the 
specification must commence on a separate sheet, preferably following 
the claims, under the heading ``Abstract'' or ``Abstract of the 
Disclosure.'' The abstract in an application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111 
may not exceed 150 words in length. The purpose of the abstract is to 
enable the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the public 
generally to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and 
gist of the technical disclosure. The abstract will not be used for 
interpreting the scope of the claims.

Sec. 1.73  Summary of the invention.

    A brief summary of the invention indicating its nature and 
substance, which may include a statement of the object of the invention, 
should precede the detailed description. Such summary should, when set 
forth, be commensurate with the invention as claimed and any object 
recited should be that of the invention as claimed.

<R05>
Sec. 1.74  Reference to drawings.

    When there are drawings, there shall be a brief description of the 
several views of the drawings and the detailed description of the 
invention shall refer to the different views by specifying the numbers 
of the figures and to the different parts by use of reference letters or 
numerals (preferably the latter).


<R05>
Sec. 1.75  Claim(s).

    (a) The specification must conclude with a claim particularly 
pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the 
applicant regards as his invention or discovery.
    (b) More than one claim may be presented provided they differ 
substantially from each other and are not unduly multiplied.
    (c) One or more claims may be presented in dependent form, referring 
back to and further limiting another claim or claims in the same 
application. Any dependent claim which refers to more than one other 
claim (``multiple dependent claim'') shall refer to such other claims in 
the alternative only. A multiple dependent claim shall not serve as a 
basis for any other multiple dependent claim. For fee calculation 
purposes under Sec. 1.16, a multiple dependent claim will be considered 
to be that number of claims to which direct reference is made therein. 
For fee calculation purposes, also, any claim depending from a multiple 
dependent claim will be considered to be that number of claims to which 
direct reference is made in that multiple dependent claim. In addition 
to the other filing fees, any original application which is filed with, 
or is amended to include, multiple dependent claims must have paid 
therein the fee set forth in Sec. 1.16(d). Claims in dependent form 
shall be construed to include all the limitations of the claim 
incorporated by reference into the dependent claim. A multiple dependent 
claim shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations 
of each of the particular claims in relation to which it is being 
considered.
    (d)(1) The claim or claims must conform to the invention as set 
forth in the remainder of the specification and the terms and phrases 
used in the claims must find clear support or antecedent basis in the 
description so that the meaning of the terms in the claims may be 
ascertainable by reference to the description. (See Sec. 1.58(a).)
    (2) See Secs. 1.141 to 1.146 as to claiming different inventions in 
one application.
    (e) Where the nature of the case admits, as in the case of an 
improvement, any independent claim should contain in the following 
order:
    (1) A preamble comprising a general description of all the elements 
or steps of the claimed combination which are conventional or known,
    (2) A phrase such as ``wherein the improvement comprises,'' and
    (3) Those elements, steps and/or relationships which constitute that 
portion of the claimed combination which the applicant considers as the 
new or improved portion.
    (f) If there are several claims, they shall be numbered 
consecutively in Arabic numerals.
    (g) The least restrictive claim should be presented as claim number 
1, and all dependent claims should be grouped together with the claim or 
claims to which they refer to the extent practicable.
    (h) The claim or claims must commence on a separate sheet.
    (i) Where a claim sets forth a plurality of elements or steps, each 
element or step of the claim should be separated by a line indentation.

<R05>
Sec. 1.76  Application data sheet.

    (a) Application data sheet. An application data sheet is a sheet or 
sheets, that may be voluntarily submitted in either provisional or 
nonprovisional applications, which contains bibliographic data, arranged 
in a format specified by the Office. If an application data sheet is 
provided, the application data sheet is part of the provisional or 
nonprovisional application for which it has been submitted.
    (b) Bibliographic data. Bibliographic data as used in paragraph (a) 
of this section includes:
    (1) Applicant information. This information includes the name, 
residence,

[[Page 58]]

mailing address, and citizenship of each applicant (Sec. 1.41(b)). The 
name of each applicant must include the family name, and at least one 
given name without abbreviation together with any other given name or 
initial. If the applicant is not an inventor, this information also 
includes the applicant's authority (Secs. 1.42, 1.43, and 1.47) to apply 
for the patent on behalf of the inventor.
    (2) Correspondence information. This information includes the 
correspondence address, which may be indicated by reference to a 
customer number, to which correspondence is to be directed (see 
Sec. 1.33(a)).
    (3) Application information. This information includes the title of 
the invention, a suggested classification, by class and subclass, the 
Technology Center to which the subject matter of the invention is 
assigned, the total number of drawing sheets, a suggested drawing figure 
for publication (in a nonprovisional application), any docket number 
assigned to the application, the type of application (e.g., utility, 
plant, design, reissue, provisional), whether the application discloses 
any significant part of the subject matter of an application under a 
secrecy order pursuant to Sec. 5.2 of this chapter (see Sec. 5.2(c)), 
and, for plant applications, the Latin name of the genus and species of 
the plant claimed, as well as the variety denomination. The suggested 
classification and Technology Center information should be supplied for 
provisional applications whether or not claims are present. If claims 
are not present in a provisional application, the suggested 
classification and Technology Center should be based upon the 
disclosure.
    (4) Representative information. This information includes the 
registration number of each practitioner having a power of attorney or 
authorization of agent in the application (preferably by reference to a 
customer number). Providing this information in the application data 
sheet does not constitute a power of attorney or authorization of agent 
in the application (see Sec. 1.34(b)).
    (5) Domestic priority information. This information includes the 
application number, the filing date, the status (including patent number 
if available), and relationship of each application for which a benefit 
is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119(e), 120, 121, or 365(c). Providing this 
information in the application data sheet constitutes the specific 
reference required by 35 U.S.C. 119(e) or 120, and Sec. 1.78(a)(2) or 
Sec. 1.78(a)(4), and need not otherwise be made part of the 
specification.
    (6) Foreign priority information. This information includes the 
application number, country, and filing date of each foreign application 
for which priority is claimed, as well as any foreign application having 
a filing date before that of the application for which priority is 
claimed. Providing this information in the application data sheet 
constitutes the claim for priority as required by 35 U.S.C. 119(b) and 
Sec. 1.55(a).
    (7) Assignee information. This information includes the name (either 
person or juristic entity) and address of the assignee of the entire 
right, title, and interest in an application. Providing this information 
in the application data sheet does not substitute for compliance with 
any requirement of part 3 of this chapter to have an assignment recorded 
by the Office.
    (c) Supplemental application data sheets. Supplemental application 
data sheets:
    (1) May be subsequently supplied prior to payment of the issue fee 
either to correct or update information in a previously submitted 
application data sheet, or an oath or declaration under Sec. 1.63 or 
Sec. 1.67, except that inventorship changes are governed by Sec. 1.48, 
correspondence changes are governed by Sec. 1.33(a), and citizenship 
changes are governed by Sec. 1.63 or Sec. 1.67; and
    (2) Should identify the information that is being changed (added, 
deleted, or modified) and therefore need not contain all the previously 
submitted information that has not changed.
    (d) Inconsistencies between application data sheet and oath or 
declaration. For inconsistencies between information that is supplied by 
both an application data sheet under this section and by an oath or 
declaration under Secs. 1.63 and 1.67:
    (1) The latest submitted information will govern notwithstanding 
whether supplied by an application data sheet,

[[Page 59]]

or by a Sec. 1.63 or Sec. 1.67 oath or declaration, except as provided 
by paragraph (d)(3) of this section;
    (2) The information in the application data sheet will govern when 
the inconsistent information is supplied at the same time by a Sec. 1.63 
or Sec. 1.67 oath or declaration, except as provided by paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section;
    (3) The oath or declaration under Sec. 1.63 or Sec. 1.67 governs 
inconsistencies with the application data sheet in the naming of 
inventors (Sec. 1.41(a)(1)) and setting forth their citizenship (35 
U.S.C. 115);
    (4) The Office will initially capture bibliographic information from 
the application data sheet (notwithstanding whether an oath or 
declaration governs the information). Thus, the Office shall generally 
not look to an oath or declaration under Sec. 1.63 to see if the 
bibliographic information contained therein is consistent with the 
bibliographic information captured from an application data sheet 
(whether the oath or declaration is submitted prior to or subsequent to 
the application data sheet). Captured bibliographic information derived 
from an application data sheet containing errors may be recaptured by a 
request therefor and the submission of a supplemental application data 
sheet, an oath or declaration under Sec. 1.63 or Sec. 1.67, or a letter 
pursuant to Sec. 1.33(b).

<R05>
Sec. 1.78  Claiming benefit of earlier filing date and cross-references to other applications.

    (a)(1) A nonprovisional application or international application 
designating the United States of America may claim an invention 
disclosed in one or more prior-filed copending nonprovisional 
applications or international applications designating the United States 
of America. In order for an application to claim the benefit of a prior-
filed copending nonprovisional application or international application 
designating the United States of America, each prior-filed application 
must name as an inventor at least one inventor named in the later-filed 
application and disclose the named inventor's invention claimed in at 
least one claim of the later-filed application in the manner provided by 
the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. In addition, each prior-filed 
application must be:
    (i) An international application entitled to a filing date in 
accordance with

[[Page 60]]

PCT Article 11 and designating the United States of America; or
    (ii) Complete as set forth in Sec. 1.51(b); or
    (iii) Entitled to a filing date as set forth in Sec. 1.53(b) or 
Sec. 1.53(d) and include the basic filing fee set forth in Sec. 1.16; or
    (iv) Entitled to a filing date as set forth in Sec. 1.53(b) and have 
paid therein the processing and retention fee set forth in Sec. 1.21(l) 
within the time period set forth in Sec. 1.53(f).
    (2)(i) Except for a continued prosecution application filed under 
Sec. 1.53(d), any nonprovisional application or international 
application designating the United States of America claiming the 
benefit of one or more prior-filed copending nonprovisional applications 
or international applications designating the United States of America 
must contain or be amended to contain a reference to each such prior-
filed application, identifying it by application number (consisting of 
the series code and serial number) or international application number 
and international filing date and indicating the relationship of the 
applications. Cross references to other related applications may be made 
when appropriate (see Sec. 1.14).
    (ii) This reference must be submitted during the pendency of the 
later-filed application. If the later-filed application is an 
application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a), this reference must also be 
submitted within the later of four months from the actual filing date of 
the later-filed application or sixteen months from the filing date of 
the prior-filed application. If the later-filed application is a 
nonprovisional application which entered the national stage from an 
international application after compliance with 35 U.S.C. 371, this 
reference must also be submitted within the later of four months from 
the date on which the national stage commenced under 35 U.S.C. 371(b) or 
(f) in the later-filed international application or sixteen months from 
the filing date of the prior-filed application. These time periods are 
not extendable. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
the failure to timely submit the reference required by 35 U.S.C. 120 and 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is considered a waiver of any 
benefit under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) to such prior-filed 
application. The time periods in this paragraph do not apply if the 
later-filed application is:
    (A) An application for a design patent;
    (B) An application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) before November 29, 
2000; or
    (C) A nonprovisional application which entered the national stage 
after compliance with 35 U.S.C. 371 from an international application 
filed under 35 U.S.C. 363 before November 29, 2000.
    (iii) If the later-filed application is a nonprovisional 
application, the reference required by this paragraph must be included 
in an application data sheet (Sec. 1.76), or the specification must 
contain or be amended to contain such reference in the first sentence 
following the title.
    (iv) The request for a continued prosecution application under 
Sec. 1.53(d) is the specific reference required by 35 U.S.C. 120 to the 
prior-filed application. The identification of an application by 
application number under this section is the identification of every 
application assigned that application number necessary for a specific 
reference required by 35 U.S.C. 120 to every such application assigned 
that application number.
    (3) If the reference required by 35 U.S.C. 120 and paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section is presented in a nonprovisional application after the 
time period provided by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the claim 
under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) for the benefit of a prior-filed 
copending nonprovisional application or international application 
designating the United States of America may be accepted if the 
reference identifying the prior-filed application by application number 
or international application number and international filing date was 
unintentionally delayed. A petition to accept an unintentionally delayed 
claim under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) for the benefit of a prior-
filed application must be accompanied by:
    (i) The reference required by 35 U.S.C. 120 and paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section to the prior-filed application, unless previously 
submitted;
    (ii) The surcharge set forth in Sec. 1.17(t); and

[[Page 61]]

    (iii) A statement that the entire delay between the date the claim 
was due under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and the date the 
claim was filed was unintentional. The Commissioner may require 
additional information where there is a question whether the delay was 
unintentional.
    (4) A nonprovisional application, other than for a design patent, or 
an international application designating the United States of America 
may claim an invention disclosed in one or more prior-filed provisional 
applications. In order for an application to claim the benefit of one or 
more prior-filed provisional applications, each prior-filed provisional 
application must name as an inventor at least one inventor named in the 
later-filed application and disclose the named inventor's invention 
claimed in at least one claim of the later-filed application in the 
manner provided by the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. In addition, 
each prior-filed provisional application must be entitled to a filing 
date as set forth in Sec. 1.53(c), and the basic filing fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.16(k) must be paid within the time period set forth in 
Sec. 1.53(g).
    (5)(i) Any nonprovisional application or international application 
designating the United States of America claiming the benefit of one or 
more prior-filed provisional applications must contain or be amended to 
contain a reference to each such prior-filed provisional application, 
identifying it by the provisional application number (consisting of 
series code and serial number).
    (ii) This reference must be submitted during the pendency of the 
later-filed application. If the later-filed application is an 
application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a), this reference must also be 
submitted within the later of four months from the actual filing date of 
the later-filed application or sixteen months from the filing date of 
the prior-filed provisional application. If the later-filed application 
is a nonprovisional application which entered the national stage from an 
international application after compliance with 35 U.S.C. 371, this 
reference must also be submitted within the later of four months from 
the date on which the national stage commenced under 35 U.S.C. 371(b) or 
(f) in the later-filed international application or sixteen months from 
the filing date of the prior-filed provisional application. These time 
periods are not extendable. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of 
this section, the failure to timely submit the reference is considered a 
waiver of any benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to such prior-filed 
provisional application. The time periods in this paragraph do not apply 
if the later-filed application is:
    (A) An application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) before November 29, 
2000; or
    (B) A nonprovisional application which entered the national stage 
after compliance with 35 U.S.C. 371 from an international application 
filed under 35 U.S.C. 363 before November 29, 2000.
    (iii) If the later-filed application is a nonprovisional 
application, the reference required by this paragraph must be included 
in an application data sheet (Sec. 1.76), or the specification must 
contain or be amended to contain such reference in the first sentence 
following the title.
    (iv) If the prior-filed provisional application was filed in a 
language other than English and an English-language translation of the 
prior-filed provisional application and a statement that the translation 
is accurate were not previously filed in the prior-filed provisional 
application or the later-filed nonprovisional application, applicant 
will be notified and given a period of time within which to file an 
English-language translation of the non-English-language prior-filed 
provisional application and a statement that the translation is 
accurate. In a pending nonprovisional application, failure to timely 
reply to such a notice will result in abandonment of the application.
    (6) If the reference required by 35 U.S.C. 119(e) and paragraph 
(a)(5) of this section is presented in a nonprovisional application 
after the time period provided by paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section, 
the claim under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) for the benefit of a prior-filed 
provisional application may be accepted during the pendency of the 
later-filed application if the reference identifying

[[Page 62]]

the prior-filed application by provisional application number was 
unintentionally delayed. A petition to accept an unintentionally delayed 
claim under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) for the benefit of a prior-filed 
provisional application must be accompanied by:
    (i) The reference required by 35 U.S.C. 119(e) and paragraph (a)(5) 
of this section to the prior-filed provisional application, unless 
previously submitted;
    (ii) The surcharge set forth in Sec. 1.17(t); and
    (iii) A statement that the entire delay between the date the claim 
was due under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section and the date the 
claim was filed was unintentional. The Commissioner may require 
additional information where there is a question whether the delay was 
unintentional.
    (b) Where two or more applications filed by the same applicant 
contain conflicting claims, elimination of such claims from all but one 
application may be required in the absence of good and sufficient reason 
for their retention during pendency in more than one application.
    (c) If an application or a patent under reexamination and at least 
one other application naming different inventors are owned by the same 
party and contain conflicting claims, and there is no statement of 
record indicating that the claimed inventions were commonly owned or 
subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person at the time 
the later invention was made, the Office may require the assignee to 
state whether the claimed inventions were commonly owned or subject to 
an obligation of assignment to the same person at the time the later 
invention was made, and, if not, indicate which named inventor is the 
prior inventor.

<R05>
Sec. 1.81  Drawings required in patent application.

    (a) The applicant for a patent is required to furnish a drawing of 
his or her invention where necessary for the understanding of the 
subject matter sought to be patented; this drawing, or a high quality 
copy thereof, must be filed with the application. Since corrections are 
the responsibility of the applicant, the original drawing(s) should be 
retained by the applicant for any necessary future correction.
    (b) Drawings may include illustrations which facilitate an 
understanding of the invention (for example, flow sheets in cases of 
processes, and diagrammatic views).
    (c) Whenever the nature of the subject matter sought to be patented 
admits of illustration by a drawing without its being necessary for the 
understanding of the subject matter and the applicant has not furnished 
such a drawing, the examiner will require its submission within a time 
period of not less than two months from the date of the sending of a 
notice thereof.
    (d) Drawings submitted after the filing date of the application may 
not be used to overcome any insufficiency of the specification due to 
lack of an enabling disclosure or otherwise inadequate disclosure 
therein, or to supplement the original disclosure thereof for the 
purpose of interpretation of the scope of any claim.

Sec. 1.83  Content of drawing.

    (a) The drawing in a nonprovisional application must show every 
feature of the invention specified in the claims. However, conventional 
features disclosed in the description and claims, where their detailed 
illustration is not essential for a proper understanding of the 
invention, should be illustrated in the drawing in the form of a 
graphical drawing symbol or a labeled representation (e.g., a labeled 
rectangular box).
    (b) When the invention consists of an improvement on an old machine 
the drawing must when possible exhibit, in one or more views, the 
improved portion itself, disconnected from the old structure, and also 
in another view, so much only of the old structure as will suffice to 
show the connection of the invention therewith.
    (c) Where the drawings in a nonprovisional application do not comply 
with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the 
examiner shall require such additional illustration within a time period 
of not less than two months from the date of the sending of a notice 
thereof. Such corrections are subject to the requirements of 
Sec. 1.81(d).

Sec. 1.84  Standards for drawings.

    (a) Drawings. There are two acceptable categories for presenting 
drawings in utility and design patent applications.
    (1) Black ink. Black and white drawings are normally required. India 
ink, or its equivalent that secures solid black lines, must be used for 
drawings; or
    (2) Color. On rare occasions, color drawings may be necessary as the 
only practical medium by which to disclose the subject matter sought to 
be patented in a utility or design patent application or the subject 
matter of a statutory invention registration. The color drawings must be 
of sufficient quality such that all details in the drawings are 
reproducible in black and white in the printed patent. Color drawings 
are not permitted in international applications (see PCT Rule 11.13), or 
in an application, or copy thereof, submitted under the Office 
electronic filing system. The Office will accept color drawings in 
utility or design patent applications and statutory invention 
registrations only after granting a petition filed under this paragraph 
explaining why the color drawings are necessary. Any such petition must 
include the following:
    (i) The fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(h);
    (ii) Three (3) sets of color drawings;
    (iii) A black and white photocopy that accurately depicts, to the 
extent possible, the subject matter shown in the color drawing; and
    (iv) An amendment to the specification to insert (unless the 
specification contains or has been previously amended to contain) the 
following language as the first paragraph of the brief description of 
the drawings:

    The patent or application file contains at least one drawing 
executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application 
publication with color drawing(s) will be provided by the Office upon 
request and payment of the necessary fee.

    (b) Photographs.--(1) Black and white. Photographs, including 
photocopies of photographs, are not ordinarily permitted in utility and 
design patent applications. The Office will accept photographs in 
utility and design patent applications, however, if photographs are the 
only practicable medium for illustrating the claimed invention. For 
example, photographs or photomicrographs of: electrophoresis gels, blots 
(e.g., immunological, western, Southern, and northern), autoradiographs, 
cell cultures (stained and unstained), histological tissue cross 
sections (stained and unstained), animals, plants, in vivo imaging, thin 
layer chromatography plates, crystalline structures, and, in a design 
patent application, ornamental effects, are acceptable. If the subject 
matter of the application admits of illustration by a drawing, the 
examiner may require a drawing in place of the photograph. The 
photographs must be of sufficient quality so that all details in the 
photographs are reproducible in the printed patent.
    (2) Color photographs. Color photographs will be accepted in utility 
and design patent applications if the conditions for accepting color 
drawings and

[[Page 64]]

black and white photographs have been satisfied. See paragraphs (a)(2) 
and (b)(1) of this section.
    (c) Identification of drawings. Identifying indicia, if provided, 
should include the title of the invention, inventor's name, and 
application number, or docket number (if any) if an application number 
has not been assigned to the application. If this information is 
provided, it must be placed on the front of each sheet and centered 
within the top margin.
    (d) Graphic forms in drawings. Chemical or mathematical formulae, 
tables, and waveforms may be submitted as drawings, and are subject to 
the same requirements as drawings. Each chemical or mathematical formula 
must be labeled as a separate figure, using brackets when necessary, to 
show that information is properly integrated. Each group of waveforms 
must be presented as a single figure, using a common vertical axis with 
time extending along the horizontal axis. Each individual waveform 
discussed in the specification must be identified with a separate letter 
designation adjacent to the vertical axis.
    (e) Type of paper. Drawings submitted to the Office must be made on 
paper which is flexible, strong, white, smooth, non-shiny, and durable. 
All sheets must be reasonably free from cracks, creases, and folds. Only 
one side of the sheet may be used for the drawing. Each sheet must be 
reasonably free from erasures and must be free from alterations, 
overwritings, and interlineations. Photographs must be developed on 
paper meeting the sheet-size requirements of paragraph (f) of this 
section and the margin requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. 
See paragraph (b) of this section for other requirements for 
photographs.
    (f) Size of paper. All drawing sheets in an application must be the 
same size. One of the shorter sides of the sheet is regarded as its top. 
The size of the sheets on which drawings are made must be:
    (1) 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4), or
    (2) 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8\1/2\ by 11 inches).
    (g) Margins. The sheets must not contain frames around the sight 
(i.e., the usable surface), but should have scan target points (i.e., 
cross-hairs) printed on two catercorner margin corners. Each sheet must 
include a top margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a left side margin of 
at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a right side margin of at least 1.5 cm. (\5/
8\ inch), and a bottom margin of at least 1.0 cm. (\3/8\ inch), thereby 
leaving a sight no greater than 17.0 cm. by 26.2 cm. on 21.0 cm. by 29.7 
cm. (DIN size A4) drawing sheets, and a sight no greater than 17.6 cm. 
by 24.4 cm. (6\15/16\ by 9\5/8\ inches) on 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8\1/2\ 
by 11 inch) drawing sheets.
    (h) Views. The drawing must contain as many views as necessary to 
show the invention. The views may be plan, elevation, section, or 
perspective views. Detail views of portions of elements, on a larger 
scale if necessary, may also be used. All views of the drawing must be 
grouped together and arranged on the sheet(s) without wasting space, 
preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from one another, 
and must not be included in the sheets containing the specifications, 
claims, or abstract. Views must not be connected by projection lines and 
must not contain center lines. Waveforms of electrical signals may be 
connected by dashed lines to show the relative timing of the waveforms.
    (1) Exploded views. Exploded views, with the separated parts 
embraced by a bracket, to show the relationship or order of assembly of 
various parts are permissible. When an exploded view is shown in a 
figure which is on the same sheet as another figure, the exploded view 
should be placed in brackets.
    (2) Partial views. When necessary, a view of a large machine or 
device in its entirety may be broken into partial views on a single 
sheet, or extended over several sheets if there is no loss in facility 
of understanding the view. Partial views drawn on separate sheets must 
always be capable of being linked edge to edge so that no partial view 
contains parts of another partial view. A smaller scale view should be 
included showing the whole formed by the partial views and indicating 
the positions of the parts shown. When a portion of a view is enlarged 
for magnification purposes, the view and the enlarged view must each be 
labeled as separate views.

[[Page 65]]

    (i) Where views on two or more sheets form, in effect, a single 
complete view, the views on the several sheets must be so arranged that 
the complete figure can be assembled without concealing any part of any 
of the views appearing on the various sheets.
    (ii) A very long view may be divided into several parts placed one 
above the other on a single sheet. However, the relationship between the 
different parts must be clear and unambiguous.
    (3) Sectional views. The plane upon which a sectional view is taken 
should be indicated on the view from which the section is cut by a 
broken line. The ends of the broken line should be designated by Arabic 
or Roman numerals corresponding to the view number of the sectional 
view, and should have arrows to indicate the direction of sight. 
Hatching must be used to indicate section portions of an object, and 
must be made by regularly spaced oblique parallel lines spaced 
sufficiently apart to enable the lines to be distinguished without 
difficulty. Hatching should not impede the clear reading of the 
reference characters and lead lines. If it is not possible to place 
reference characters outside the hatched area, the hatching may be 
broken off wherever reference characters are inserted. Hatching must be 
at a substantial angle to the surrounding axes or principal lines, 
preferably 45 deg.. A cross section must be set out and drawn to show 
all of the materials as they are shown in the view from which the cross 
section was taken. The parts in cross section must show proper 
material(s) by hatching with regularly spaced parallel oblique strokes, 
the space between strokes being chosen on the basis of the total area to 
be hatched. The various parts of a cross section of the same item should 
be hatched in the same manner and should accurately and graphically 
indicate the nature of the material(s) that is illustrated in cross 
section. The hatching of juxtaposed different elements must be angled in 
a different way. In the case of large areas, hatching may be confined to 
an edging drawn around the entire inside of the outline of the area to 
be hatched. Different types of hatching should have different 
conventional meanings as regards the nature of a material seen in cross 
section.
    (4) Alternate position. A moved position may be shown by a broken 
line superimposed upon a suitable view if this can be done without 
crowding; otherwise, a separate view must be used for this purpose.
    (5) Modified forms. Modified forms of construction must be shown in 
separate views.
    (i) Arrangement of views. One view must not be placed upon another 
or within the outline of another. All views on the same sheet should 
stand in the same direction and, if possible, stand so that they can be 
read with the sheet held in an upright position. If views wider than the 
width of the sheet are necessary for the clearest illustration of the 
invention, the sheet may be turned on its side so that the top of the 
sheet, with the appropriate top margin to be used as the heading space, 
is on the right-hand side. Words must appear in a horizontal, left-to-
right fashion when the page is either upright or turned so that the top 
becomes the right side, except for graphs utilizing standard scientific 
convention to denote the axis of abscissas (of X) and the axis of 
ordinates (of Y).
    (j) Front page view. The drawing must contain as many views as 
necessary to show the invention. One of the views should be suitable for 
inclusion on the front page of the patent application publication and 
patent as the illustration of the invention. Views must not be connected 
by projection lines and must not contain center lines. Applicant may 
suggest a single view (by figure number) for inclusion on the front page 
of the patent application publication and patent.
    (k) Scale. The scale to which a drawing is made must be large enough 
to show the mechanism without crowding when the drawing is reduced in 
size to two-thirds in reproduction. Indications such as ``actual size'' 
or ``scale \1/2\'' on the drawings are not permitted since these lose 
their meaning with reproduction in a different format.
    (l) Character of lines, numbers, and letters. All drawings must be 
made by a process which will give them satisfactory reproduction 
characteristics. Every line, number, and letter must be

[[Page 66]]

durable, clean, black (except for color drawings), sufficiently dense 
and dark, and uniformly thick and well-defined. The weight of all lines 
and letters must be heavy enough to permit adequate reproduction. This 
requirement applies to all lines however fine, to shading, and to lines 
representing cut surfaces in sectional views. Lines and strokes of 
different thicknesses may be used in the same drawing where different 
thicknesses have a different meaning.
    (m) Shading. The use of shading in views is encouraged if it aids in 
understanding the invention and if it does not reduce legibility. 
Shading is used to indicate the surface or shape of spherical, 
cylindrical, and conical elements of an object. Flat parts may also be 
lightly shaded. Such shading is preferred in the case of parts shown in 
perspective, but not for cross sections. See paragraph (h)(3) of this 
section. Spaced lines for shading are preferred. These lines must be 
thin, as few in number as practicable, and they must contrast with the 
rest of the drawings. As a substitute for shading, heavy lines on the 
shade side of objects can be used except where they superimpose on each 
other or obscure reference characters. Light should come from the upper 
left corner at an angle of 45 deg.. Surface delineations should 
preferably be shown by proper shading. Solid black shading areas are not 
permitted, except when used to represent bar graphs or color.
    (n) Symbols. Graphical drawing symbols may be used for conventional 
elements when appropriate. The elements for which such symbols and 
labeled representations are used must be adequately identified in the 
specification. Known devices should be illustrated by symbols which have 
a universally recognized conventional meaning and are generally accepted 
in the art. Other symbols which are not universally recognized may be 
used, subject to approval by the Office, if they are not likely to be 
confused with existing conventional symbols, and if they are readily 
identifiable.
    (o) Legends. Suitable descriptive legends may be used subject to 
approval by the Office, or may be required by the examiner where 
necessary for understanding of the drawing. They should contain as few 
words as possible.
    (p) Numbers, letters, and reference characters. (1) Reference 
characters (numerals are preferred), sheet numbers, and view numbers 
must be plain and legible, and must not be used in association with 
brackets or inverted commas, or enclosed within outlines, e.g., 
encircled. They must be oriented in the same direction as the view so as 
to avoid having to rotate the sheet. Reference characters should be 
arranged to follow the profile of the object depicted.
    (2) The English alphabet must be used for letters, except where 
another alphabet is customarily used, such as the Greek alphabet to 
indicate angles, wavelengths, and mathematical formulas.
    (3) Numbers, letters, and reference characters must measure at least 
.32 cm. (\1/8\ inch) in height. They should not be placed in the drawing 
so as to interfere with its comprehension. Therefore, they should not 
cross or mingle with the lines. They should not be placed upon hatched 
or shaded surfaces. When necessary, such as indicating a surface or 
cross section, a reference character may be underlined and a blank space 
may be left in the hatching or shading where the character occurs so 
that it appears distinct.
    (4) The same part of an invention appearing in more than one view of 
the drawing must always be designated by the same reference character, 
and the same reference character must never be used to designate 
different parts.
    (5) Reference characters not mentioned in the description shall not 
appear in the drawings. Reference characters mentioned in the 
description must appear in the drawings.
    (q) Lead lines. Lead lines are those lines between the reference 
characters and the details referred to. Such lines may be straight or 
curved and should be as short as possible. They must originate in the 
immediate proximity of the reference character and extend to the feature 
indicated. Lead lines must not cross each other. Lead lines are required 
for each reference character except for those which indicate the surface 
or cross section on which

[[Page 67]]

they are placed. Such a reference character must be underlined to make 
it clear that a lead line has not been left out by mistake. Lead lines 
must be executed in the same way as lines in the drawing. See paragraph 
(l) of this section.
    (r) Arrows. Arrows may be used at the ends of the lines, provided 
that their meaning is clear, as follows:
    (1) On a lead line, a freestanding arrow to indicate the entire 
section towards which it points;
    (2) On a lead line, an arrow touching a line to indicate the surface 
shown by the line looking along the direction of the arrow; or
    (3) To show the direction of movement.
    (s) Copyright or Mask Work Notice. A copyright or mask work notice 
may appear in the drawing, but must be placed within the sight of the 
drawing immediately below the figure representing the copyright or mask 
work material and be limited to letters having a print size of .32 cm. 
to .64 cm. (1/8 to 1/4 inches) high. The content of the notice must be 
limited to only those elements provided for by law. For example, 
``<SUP>[copy]</SUP>1983 John Doe'' (17 U.S.C. 401) and ``*M* John Doe'' 
(17 U.S.C. 909) would be properly limited and, under current statutes, 
legally sufficient notices of copyright and mask work, respectively. 
Inclusion of a copyright or mask work notice will be permitted only if 
the authorization language set forth in Sec. 1.71(e) is included at the 
beginning (preferably as the first paragraph) of the specification.
    (t) Numbering of sheets of drawings. The sheets of drawings should 
be numbered in consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, within the 
sight as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. These numbers, if 
present, must be placed in the middle of the top of the sheet, but not 
in the margin. The numbers can be placed on the right-hand side if the 
drawing extends too close to the middle of the top edge of the usable 
surface. The drawing sheet numbering must be clear and larger than the 
numbers used as reference characters to avoid confusion. The number of 
each sheet should be shown by two Arabic numerals placed on either side 
of an oblique line, with the first being the sheet number, and the 
second being the total number of sheets of drawings, with no other 
marking.
    (u) Numbering of views. (1) The different views must be numbered in 
consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, independent of the 
numbering of the sheets and, if possible, in the order in which they 
appear on the drawing sheet(s). Partial views intended to form one 
complete view, on one or several sheets, must be identified by the same 
number followed by a capital letter. View numbers must be preceded by 
the abbreviation ``FIG.'' Where only a single view is used in an 
application to illustrate the claimed invention, it must not be numbered 
and the abbreviation ``FIG.'' must not appear.
    (2) Numbers and letters identifying the views must be simple and 
clear and must not be used in association with brackets, circles, or 
inverted commas. The view numbers must be larger than the numbers used 
for reference characters.
    (v) Security markings. Authorized security markings may be placed on 
the drawings provided they are outside the sight, preferably centered in 
the top margin.
    (w) Corrections. Any corrections on drawings submitted to the Office 
must be durable and permanent.
    (x) Holes. No holes should be made by applicant in the drawing 
sheets.
    (y) Types of drawings. See Sec. 1.152 for design drawings, 
Sec. 1.165 for plant drawings, and Sec. 1.174 for reissue drawings.

<R05>
Sec. 1.85  Corrections to drawings.

    (a) A utility or plant application will not be placed on the files 
for examination until objections to the drawings have been corrected. 
Except as provided in Sec. 1.215(c), any patent application publication 
will not include drawings filed after the application has been placed on 
the files for examination. Unless applicant is otherwise notified in an 
Office action, objections to the drawings in a utility or plant 
application will not be held in abeyance, and a request to hold 
objections to the

[[Page 68]]

drawings in abeyance will not be considered a bona fide attempt to 
advance the application to final action (Sec. 1.135(c)). If a drawing in 
a design application meets the requirements of Sec. 1.84(e), (f), and 
(g) and is suitable for reproduction, but is not otherwise in compliance 
with Sec. 1.84, the drawing may be admitted for examination.
    (b) The Office will not release drawings for purposes of correction. 
If corrections are necessary, new corrected drawings must be submitted 
within the time set by the Office.
    (c) If a corrected drawing is required or if a drawing does not 
comply with Sec. 1.84 at the time an application is allowed, the Office 
may notify the applicant and set a three month period of time from the 
mail date of the notice of allowability within which the applicant must 
file a corrected or formal drawing in compliance with Sec. 1.84 to avoid 
abandonment. This time period is not extendable under Sec. 1.136(a) or 
Sec. 1.136(b).

<R05>
Sec. 1.96  Submission of computer program listings.

    (a) General. Descriptions of the operation and general content of 
computer program listings should appear in the description portion of 
the specification. A computer program listing for the purpose of this 
section is defined as a printout that lists in appropriate sequence the 
instructions, routines, and other contents of a program for a computer. 
The program listing may be either in machine or machine-independent 
(object or source) language which will cause a computer to perform a 
desired procedure or task such as solve a problem, regulate the flow of

[[Page 69]]

work in a computer, or control or monitor events. Computer program 
listings may be submitted in patent applications as set forth in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Material which will be printed in the patent: If the computer 
program listing is contained in 300 lines or fewer, with each line of 72 
characters or fewer, it may be submitted either as drawings or as part 
of the specification.
    (1) Drawings. If the listing is submitted as drawings, it must be 
submitted in the manner and complying with the requirements for drawings 
as provided in Sec. 1.84. At least one figure numeral is required on 
each sheet of drawing.
    (2) Specification. (i) If the listing is submitted as part of the 
specification, it must be submitted in accordance with the provisions of 
Sec. 1.52.
    (ii) Any listing having more than 60 lines of code that is submitted 
as part of the specification must be positioned at the end of the 
description but before the claims. Any amendment must be made by way of 
submission of a substitute sheet.
    (c) As an appendix which will not be printed: Any computer program 
listing may, and any computer program listing having over 300 lines (up 
to 72 characters per line) must, be submitted on a compact disc in 
compliance with Sec. 1.52(e). A compact disc containing such a computer 
program listing is to be referred to as a ``computer program listing 
appendix.'' The ``computer program listing appendix'' will not be part 
of the printed patent. The specification must include a reference to the 
``computer program listing appendix'' at the location indicated in 
Sec. 1.77(b)(4).
    (1) Multiple computer program listings for a single application may 
be placed on a single compact disc. Multiple compact discs may be 
submitted for a single application if necessary. A separate compact disc 
is required for each application containing a computer program listing 
that must be submitted on a ``computer program listing appendix.''
    (2) The ``computer program listing appendix'' must be submitted on a 
compact disc that complies with Sec. 1.52(e) and the following 
specifications (no other format shall be allowed):
    (i) Computer Compatibility: IBM PC/XT/AT, or compatibles, or Apple 
Macintosh;
    (ii) Operating System Compatibility: MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Unix, or 
Macintosh;
    (iii) Line Terminator: ASCII Carriage Return plus ASCII Line Feed;

                    Information Disclosure Statement


<R05>
Sec. 1.97  Filing of information disclosure statement.

    (a) In order for an applicant for a patent or for a reissue of a 
patent to have an information disclosure statement in compliance with 
Sec. 1.98 considered by the Office during the pendency of the 
application, the information disclosure statement must satisfy one of 
paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
    (b) An information disclosure statement shall be considered by the

patent office in a counterpart foreign application not more than three 
months prior to the filing of the information disclosure statement; or
    (2) That no item of information contained in the information 
disclosure statement was cited in a communication from a foreign patent 
office in a counterpart foreign application, and, to the knowledge of 
the person signing the certification after making reasonable inquiry, no 
item of information contained in the information disclosure statement 
was known to any individual designated in Sec. 1.56(c) more than three 
months prior to the filing of the information disclosure statement.
    (f) No extensions of time for filing an information disclosure 
statement are permitted under Sec. 1.136. If a bona fide attempt is made 
to comply with Sec. 1.98, but part of the required content is 
inadvertently omitted, additional time may be given to enable full 
compliance.
    (g) An information disclosure statement filed in accordance with 
this section shall not be construed as a representation that a search 
has been made.
    (h) The filing of an information disclosure statement shall not be 
construed to be an admission that the information cited in the statement 
is, or is considered to be, material to patentability as defined in 
Sec. 1.56(b).
    (i) If an information disclosure statement does not comply with 
either this section or Sec. 1.98, it will be placed in the file but will 
not be considered by the Office.

<R05>
Sec. 1.104  Nature of examination.

    (a) Examiner's action. (1) On taking up an application for 
examination or a patent in a reexamination proceeding, the examiner 
shall make a thorough study thereof and shall make a thorough 
investigation of the available prior art relating to the subject matter 
of the claimed invention. The examination shall be complete with respect 
both to compliance of the application or patent under reexamination with 
the applicable statutes and rules and to the patentability of the 
invention as claimed, as well as with respect to matters of form, unless 
otherwise indicated.
    (2) The applicant, or in the case of a reexamination proceeding, 
both the patent owner and the requester, will be notified of the 
examiner's action. The reasons for any adverse action or any objection 
or requirement will be stated in an Office action and such information 
or references will be given as may be useful in aiding the applicant, or 
in the case of a reexamination proceeding the patent owner, to judge the 
propriety of continuing the prosecution.
    (3) An international-type search will be made in all national 
applications filed on and after June 1, 1978.
    (4) Any national application may also have an international-type 
search report prepared thereon at the time of the national examination 
on the merits, upon specific written request therefor and payment of the 
international-type search report fee set forth in Sec. 1.21(e). The 
Patent and Trademark Office does not require that a formal report of an 
international-type search be prepared in order to obtain a search fee 
refund in a later filed international application.
    (b) Completeness of examiner's action. The examiner's action will be 
complete as to all matters, except that in appropriate circumstances, 
such as misjoinder of invention, fundamental defects in the application, 
and the like, the action of the examiner may be limited to such matters 
before further action is made. However, matters of form need not be 
raised by the examiner until a claim is found allowable.
    (c) Rejection of claims. (1) If the invention is not considered 
patentable, or not considered patentable as claimed, the claims, or 
those considered unpatentable will be rejected.
    (2) In rejecting claims for want of novelty or for obviousness, the 
examiner must cite the best references at his or her command. When a 
reference is complex or shows or describes inventions other than that 
claimed by the applicant, the particular part relied on must be 
designated as nearly as practicable. The pertinence of each reference, 
if not apparent, must be clearly explained and each rejected claim 
specified.
    (3) In rejecting claims the examiner may rely upon admissions by the 
applicant, or the patent owner in a reexamination proceeding, as to any 
matter affecting patentability and, insofar as

[[Page 74]]

rejections in applications are concerned, may also rely upon facts 
within his or her knowledge pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (4) Subject matter which is developed by another person which 
qualifies as prior art only under 35 U.S.C. 102(e), (f) or (g) may be 
used as prior art under 35 U.S.C. 103 against a claimed invention unless 
the entire rights to the subject matter and the claimed invention were 
commonly owned by the same person or organization or subject to an 
obligation of assignment to the same person or organization at the time 
the claimed invention was made.
    (5) The claims in any original application naming an inventor will 
be rejected as being precluded by a waiver in a published statutory 
invention registration naming that inventor if the same subject matter 
is claimed in the application and the statutory invention registration. 
The claims in any reissue application naming an inventor will be 
rejected as being precluded by a waiver in a published statutory 
invention registration naming that inventor if the reissue application 
seeks to claim subject matter:
    (i) Which was not covered by claims issued in the patent prior to 
the date of publication of the statutory invention registration; and
    (ii) Which was the same subject matter waived in the statutory 
invention registration.
    (d) Citation of references. (1) If domestic patents are cited by the 
examiner, their numbers and dates, and the names of the patentees will 
be stated. If domestic patent application publications are cited by the 
examiner, their publication number, publication date, and the names of 
the applicants will be stated. If foreign published applications or 
patents are cited, their nationality or country, numbers and dates, and 
the names of the patentees will be stated, and such other data will be 
furnished as may be necessary to enable the applicant, or in the case of 
a reexamination proceeding, the patent owner, to identify the published 
applications or patents cited. In citing foreign published applications 
or patents, in case only a part of the document is involved, the 
particular pages and sheets containing the parts relied upon will be 
identified. If printed publications are cited, the author (if any), 
title, date, pages or plates, and place of publication, or place where a 
copy can be found, will be given.
    (2) When a rejection in an application is based on facts within the 
personal knowledge of an employee of the Office, the data shall be as 
specific as possible, and the reference must be supported, when called 
for by the applicant, by the affidavit of such employee, and such 
affidavit shall be subject to contradiction or explanation by the 
affidavits of the applicant and other persons.
    (e) Reasons for allowance. If the examiner believes that the record 
of the prosecution as a whole does not make clear his or her reasons for 
allowing a claim or claims, the examiner may set forth such reasoning. 
The reasons shall be incorporated into an Office action rejecting other 
claims of the application or patent under reexamination or be the 
subject of a separate communication to the applicant or patent owner. 
The applicant or patent owner may file a statement commenting on the 
reasons for allowance within such time as may be specified by the 
examiner. Failure by the examiner to respond to any statement commenting 
on reasons for allowance does not give rise to any implication.

Sec. 1.105  Requirements for information.

    (a)(1) In the course of examining or treating a matter in a pending 
or abandoned application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111 or 371 (including a 
reissue application), in a patent, or in a reexamination proceeding, the 
examiner or other Office employee may require the submission, from 
individuals identified under Sec. 1.56(c), or any assignee, of such 
information as may be reasonably necessary to properly examine or treat 
the matter, for example:
    (i) Commercial databases: The existence of any particularly relevant 
commercial database known to any of the inventors that could be searched 
for a particular aspect of the invention.

[[Page 75]]

    (ii) Search: Whether a search of the prior art was made, and if so, 
what was searched.
    (iii) Related information: A copy of any non-patent literature, 
published application, or patent (U.S. or foreign), by any of the 
inventors, that relates to the claimed invention.
    (iv) Information used to draft application: A copy of any non-patent 
literature, published application, or patent (U.S. or foreign) that was 
used to draft the application.
    (v) Information used in invention process: A copy of any non-patent 
literature, published application, or patent (U.S. or foreign) that was 
used in the invention process, such as by designing around or providing 
a solution to accomplish an invention result.
    (vi) Improvements: Where the claimed invention is an improvement, 
identification of what is being improved.
    (vii) In use: Identification of any use of the claimed invention 
known to any of the inventors at the time the application was filed 
notwithstanding the date of the use.
    (2) Where an assignee has asserted its right to prosecute pursuant 
to Sec. 3.71(a) of this chapter, matters such as paragraphs (a)(1)(i), 
(iii), and (vii) of this section may also be applied to such assignee.
    (3) Any reply that states that the information required to be 
submitted is unknown and/or is not readily available to the party or 
parties from which it was requested will be accepted as a complete 
reply.
    (b) The requirement for information of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section may be included in an Office action, or sent separately.
    (c) A reply, or a failure to reply, to a requirement for information 
under this section will be governed by Secs. 1.135 and 1.136.

Sec. 1.110  Inventorship and date of invention of the subject matter of individual claims.

    When more than one inventor is named in an application or patent, 
the Patent and Trademark Office, when necessary for purposes of an 
Office proceeding, may require an applicant, patentee, or owner to 
identify the inventive entity of the subject matter of each claim in the 
application or patent. Where appropriate, the invention dates of the 
subject matter of each claim and the ownership of the subject matter on 
the date of invention may be required of the applicant, patentee or 
owner. See also Secs. 1.78(c) and 1.130.

<R05>
Sec. 1.111  Reply by applicant or patent owner to a non-final Office action.

    (a)(1) If the Office action after the first examination (Sec. 1.104) 
is adverse in any respect, the applicant or patent owner, if he or she 
persists in his or her application for a patent or reexamination 
proceeding, must reply and request reconsideration or further 
examination, with or without amendment. See Secs. 1.135 and 1.136 for 
time for reply to avoid abandonment.
    (2) A second (or subsequent) supplemental reply will be entered 
unless disapproved by the Commissioner. A second (or subsequent) 
supplemental reply may be disapproved if the second (or subsequent) 
supplemental reply unduly interferes with an Office action being 
prepared in response to the previous reply. Factors that will be 
considered in disapproving a second (or subsequent) supplemental reply 
include:
    (i) The state of preparation of an Office action responsive to the 
previous reply as of the date of receipt (Sec. 1.6) of the second (or 
subsequent) supplemental reply by the Office; and
    (ii) The nature of any changes to the specification or claims that 
would result from entry of the second (or subsequent) supplemental 
reply.
    (b) In order to be entitled to reconsideration or further 
examination, the applicant or patent owner must reply to the Office 
action. The reply by the applicant or patent owner must be reduced to a 
writing which distinctly and specifically points out the supposed errors 
in the examiner's action and must reply to every ground of objection and

[[Page 76]]

rejection in the prior Office action. The reply must present arguments 
pointing out the specific distinctions believed to render the claims, 
including any newly presented claims, patentable over any applied 
references. If the reply is with respect to an application, a request 
may be made that objections or requirements as to form not necessary to 
further consideration of the claims be held in abeyance until allowable 
subject matter is indicated. The applicant's or patent owner's reply 
must appear throughout to be a bona fide attempt to advance the 
application or the reexamination proceeding to final action. A general 
allegation that the claims define a patentable invention without 
specifically pointing out how the language of the claims patentably 
distinguishes them from the references does not comply with the 
requirements of this section.
    (c) In amending in reply to a rejection of claims in an application 
or patent under reexamination, the applicant or patent owner must 
clearly point out the patentable novelty which he or she thinks the 
claims present in view of the state of the art disclosed by the 
references cited or the objections made. The applicant or patent owner 
must also show how the amendments avoid such references or objections.

Sec. 1.112  Reconsideration before final action.

    After reply by applicant or patent owner (Sec. 1.111 or Sec. 1.945) 
to a non-final action and any comments by an inter partes reexamination 
requester (Sec. 1.947), the application or the patent under 
reexamination will be reconsidered and again examined. The applicant, or 
in the case of a reexamination proceeding the patent owner and any third 
party requester, will be notified if claims are rejected, objections or 
requirements made, or decisions favorable to patentability are made, in 
the same manner as after the first examination (Sec. 1.104). Applicant 
or patent owner may reply to such Office action in the same manner 
provided in Sec. 1.111 or Sec. 1.945, with or without amendment, unless 
such Office action indicates that it is made final (Sec. 1.113) or an 
appeal (Sec. 1.191) has been taken (Sec. 1.116), or in an inter partes 
reexamination, that it is an action closing prosecution (Sec. 1.949) or 
a right of appeal notice (Sec. 1.953).

applicant's, or for ex parte reexaminations filed under Sec. 1.510, 
patent owner's reply is limited to appeal in the case of rejection of 
any claim (Sec. 1.191), or to amendment as specified in Sec. 1.114 or 
Sec. 1.116. Petition may be taken to the Commissioner in the case of 
objections or requirements not involved in the rejection of any claim 
(Sec. 1.181). Reply to a final rejection or action must comply with 
Sec. 1.114 or paragraph (c) of this section. For final actions in an 
inter partes reexamination filed under Sec. 1.913, see Sec. 1.953.
    (b) In making such final rejection, the examiner shall repeat or 
state all grounds of rejection then considered applicable to the claims 
in the application, clearly stating the reasons in support thereof.
    (c) Reply to a final rejection or action must include cancellation 
of, or appeal from the rejection of, each rejected claim. If any claim 
stands allowed, the reply to a final rejection or action must comply

Sec. 1.114  Request for continued examination.

    (a) If prosecution in an application is closed, an applicant may 
request continued examination of the application by filing a submission 
and the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(e) prior to the earliest of:
    (1) Payment of the issue fee, unless a petition under Sec. 1.313 is 
granted;
    (2) Abandonment of the application; or
    (3) The filing of a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Federal Circuit under 35 U.S.C. 141, or the commencement of a 
civil action under

[[Page 77]]

35 U.S.C. 145 or 146, unless the appeal or civil action is terminated.
    (b) Prosecution in an application is closed as used in this section 
means that the application is under appeal, or that the last Office 
action is a final action (Sec. 1.113), a notice of allowance 
(Sec. 1.311), or an action that otherwise closes prosecution in the 
application.
    (c) A submission as used in this section includes, but is not 
limited to, an information disclosure statement, an amendment to the 
written description, claims, or drawings, new arguments, or new evidence 
in support of patentability. If reply to an Office action under 35 
U.S.C. 132 is outstanding, the submission must meet the reply 
requirements of Sec. 1.111.
    (d) If an applicant timely files a submission and fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(e), the Office will withdraw the finality of any Office action 
and the submission will be entered and considered. If an applicant files 
a request for continued examination under this section after appeal, but 
prior to a decision on the appeal, it will be treated as a request to 
withdraw the appeal and to reopen prosecution of the application before 
the examiner. An appeal brief under Sec. 1.192 or a reply brief under 
Sec. 1.193(b), or related papers, will not be considered a submission 
under this section.
    (e) The provisions of this section do not apply to:
    (1) A provisional application;
    (2) An application for a utility or plant patent filed under 35 
U.S.C. 111(a) before June 8, 1995;
    (3) An international application filed under 35 U.S.C. 363 before 
June 8, 1995;
    (4) An application for a design patent; or
    (5) A patent under reexamination.

<R05>
Sec. 1.115  Preliminary amendments.

    (a) A preliminary amendment is an amendment that is received in the 
Office (Sec. 1.6) on or before the mail date of the first Office action 
under Sec. 1.104.
    (b)(1) A preliminary amendment will be entered unless disapproved by 
the Commissioner. A preliminary amendment may be disapproved if the 
preliminary amendment unduly interferes with the preparation of a first 
Office action in an application. Factors that will be considered in 
disapproving a preliminary amendment include:
    (i) The state of preparation of a first Office action as of the date 
of receipt (Sec. 1.6) of the preliminary amendment by the Office; and
    (ii) The nature of any changes to the specification or claims that 
would result from entry of the preliminary amendment.
    (2) A preliminary amendment will not be disapproved if it is filed 
no later than:
    (i) Three months from the filing date of an application under 
Sec. 1.53(b);
    (ii) The filing date of a continued prosecution application under 
Sec. 1.53(d); or
    (iii) Three months from the date the national stage is entered as 
set forth in Sec. 1.491 in an international application.
    (c) The time periods specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
are not extendable.

<R05>
Sec. 1.116  Amendments after final action or appeal

    (a) An amendment after final action or appeal must comply with 
Sec. 1.114 or this section.
    (b) After a final rejection or other final action (Sec. 1.113) in an 
application or in an ex parte reexamination filed under Sec. 1.510, or 
an action closing prosecution (Sec. 1.949) in an inter partes 
reexamination filed under Sec. 1.913, amendments may be made canceling 
claims or complying with any requirement of form expressly set forth in 
a previous Office action. Amendments presenting rejected claims in 
better form for consideration on appeal may be admitted. The admission 
of, or refusal to admit, any amendment after a final rejection, a final 
action, an action closing prosecution, or any related proceedings will 
not operate to relieve the application or patent under reexamination 
from its condition as subject to appeal or to save the application from 
abandonment under Sec. 1.135, or the reexamination from termination. No 
amendment

[[Page 78]]

can be made in an inter partes reexamination proceeding after the right 
of appeal notice under Sec. 1.953 except as provided for in paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (c) If amendments touching the merits of the application or patent 
under reexamination are presented after final rejection, or after appeal 
has been taken, or when such amendment might not otherwise be proper, 
they may be admitted upon a showing of good and sufficient reasons why 
they are necessary and were not earlier presented.
    (d) No amendment can be made as a matter of right in appealed cases. 
After decision on appeal, amendments can only be made as provided in 
Secs. 1.198 and 1.981, or to carry into effect a recommendation under 
Sec. 1.196 or Sec. 1.977.

<R05>
Secs. 1.117-1.119  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.121  Manner of making amendments in applications.

    (a) Amendments in applications, other than reissue applications. 
Amendments in applications, other than reissue applications, are made by 
filing a paper, in compliance with Sec. 1.52, directing that specified 
amendments be made.
    (b) Specification other than the claims and listings provided for 
elsewhere (Secs. 1.96 and 1.825)--(1) Amendment by instruction to 
delete, replace, or add a paragraph. Amendments to the specification, 
other than the claims and listings provided for elsewhere (Secs. 1.96 
and 1.825), may be made by submitting:
    (i) An instruction, which unambiguously identifies the location, to 
delete one or more paragraphs of the specification, replace a deleted 
paragraph with one or more replacement paragraphs, or add one or more 
paragraphs;
    (ii) Any replacement or added paragraph(s) in clean form, that is, 
without markings to indicate the changes that have been made; and
    (iii) Another version of any replacement paragraph(s), on one or 
more pages separate from the amendment, marked up to show all the 
changes relative to the previous version of the paragraph(s). The 
changes may be shown by brackets (for deleted matter) or underlining 
(for added matter), or by any equivalent marking system. A marked up 
version does not have to be supplied for an added paragraph or a deleted 
paragraph as it is sufficient to state that a particular paragraph has 
been added, or deleted.
    (2) Amendment by replacement section. If the sections of the 
specification contain section headings as provided in Secs. 1.77(b), 
1.154(b), or Sec. 1.163(c), amendments to the specification, other than 
the claims, may be made by submitting:
    (i) A reference to the section heading along with an instruction to 
delete that section of the specification and to replace such deleted 
section with a replacement section;
    (ii) A replacement section in clean form, that is, without markings 
to indicate the changes that have been made; and
    (iii) Another version of the replacement section, on one or more 
pages separate from the amendment, marked up to show all changes 
relative to the previous version of the section. The changes may be 
shown by brackets (for deleted matter) or underlining (for added 
matter), or by any equivalent marking system.
    (3) Amendment by substitute specification. The specification, other 
than the claims, may also be amended by submitting:
    (i) An instruction to replace the specification;
    (ii) A substitute specification in compliance with Sec. 1.125(b); 
and
    (iii) Another version of the substitute specification, separate from 
the substitute specification, marked up to show all changes relative to 
the previous version of the specification. The changes may be shown by 
brackets (for deleted matter), or underlining (for added matter), or by 
any equivalent marking system.
    (4) Reinstatement: Deleted matter may be reinstated only by a 
subsequent amendment presenting the previously deleted matter.
    (c) Claims--(1) Amendment by rewriting, directions to cancel or add: 
Amendments to a claim must be made by rewriting such claim with all 
changes (e.g., additions, deletions, modifications) included. The 
rewriting of a claim (with the same number) will be

[[Page 79]]

construed as directing the cancellation of the previous version of that 
claim. A claim may also be canceled by an instruction.
    (i) A rewritten or newly added claim must be in clean form, that is, 
without markings to indicate the changes that have been made. A 
parenthetical expression should follow the claim number indicating the 
status of the claim as amended or newly added (e.g., ``amended,'' 
``twice amended,'' or ``new'').
    (ii) If a claim is amended by rewriting such claim with the same 
number, the amendment must be accompanied by another version of the 
rewritten claim, on one or more pages separate from the amendment, 
marked up to show all the changes relative to the previous version of 
that claim. A parenthetical expression should follow the claim number 
indicating the status of the claim, e.g., ``amended,'' ``twice 
amended,'' etc. The parenthetical expression ``amended,'' ``twice 
amended,'' etc. should be the same for both the clean version of the 
claim under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section and the marked up 
version under this paragraph. The changes may be shown by brackets (for 
deleted matter) or underlining (for added matter), or by any equivalent 
marking system. A marked up version does not have to be supplied for an 
added claim or a canceled claim as it is sufficient to state that a 
particular claim has been added, or canceled.
    (2) A claim canceled by amendment (deleted in its entirety) may be 
reinstated only by a subsequent amendment presenting the claim as a new 
claim with a new claim number.
    (3) A clean version of the entire set of pending claims may be 
submitted in a single amendment paper. Such a submission shall be 
construed as directing the cancellation of all previous versions of any 
pending claims. A marked up version is required only for claims being 
changed by the current amendment (see paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
section). Any claim not accompanied by a marked up version will 
constitute an assertion that it has not been changed relative to the 
immediate prior version.
    (d) Drawings. Application drawings are amended in the following 
manner: Any change to the application drawings must be submitted on a 
separate paper showing the proposed changes in red for approval by the 
examiner. Upon approval by the examiner, new drawings in compliance with 
Sec. 1.84 including the changes must be filed.
    (e) Disclosure consistency. The disclosure must be amended, when 
required by the Office, to correct inaccuracies of description and 
definition, and to secure substantial correspondence between the claims, 
the remainder of the specification, and the drawings.
    (f) No new matter. No amendment may introduce new matter into the 
disclosure of an application.
    (g) Exception for examiner's amendments: Changes to the 
specification, including the claims, of an application made by the 
Office in an examiner's amendment may be made by specific instructions 
to insert or delete subject matter set forth in the examiner's amendment 
by identifying the precise point in the specification or the claim(s) 
where the insertion or deletion is to be made. Compliance with 
paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2) or (c)(1) of this section is not required.
    (h) Amendments in reissue applications. Any amendment to the 
description and claims in reissue applications must be made in 
accordance with Sec. 1.173.
    (i) Amendments in reexamination proceedings: Any proposed amendment 
to the description and claims in patents involved in reexamination 
proceedings in both ex parte reexaminations filed under Sec. 1.510 and 
inter partes reexaminations filed under Sec. 1.913 must be made in 
accordance with Sec. 1.530(d)-(j).
    (j) Amendments in provisional applications: Amendments in 
provisional applications are not normally made. If an amendment is made 
to a provisional application, however, it must comply with the 
provisions of this section. Any amendments to a provisional application 
shall be placed in the provisional application file but may not be 
entered.

Secs. 1.122-1.24  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.125  Substitute specification.

    (a) If the number or nature of the amendments or the legibility of 
the application papers renders it difficult to consider the application, 
or to arrange the papers for printing or copying, the Office may require 
the entire specification, including the claims, or any part thereof, be 
rewritten.
    (b) A substitute specification, excluding the claims, may be filed 
at any point up to payment of the issue fee if it is accompanied by:
    (1) A statement that the substitute specification includes no new 
matter; and
    (2) A marked up version of the substitute specification showing all 
the changes (including the matter being added to and the matter being 
deleted from) to the specification of record. Numbering the paragraphs 
of the specification of record is not considered a change that must be 
shown pursuant to this paragraph.
    (c) A substitute specification submitted under this section must be 
submitted in clean form without markings as to amended material. The 
paragraphs of any substitute specification, other than the claims, 
should be individually numbered in Arabic numerals so that any amendment 
to the specification may be made by replacement paragraph in accordance 
with Sec. 1.121(b)(1).
    (d) A substitute specification under this section is not permitted 
in a reissue application or in a reexamination proceeding.

Sec. 1.126  Numbering of claims.

    The original numbering of the claims must be preserved throughout 
the prosecution. When claims are canceled the remaining claims must not 
be renumbered. When claims are added, they must be numbered by the 
applicant consecutively beginning with the number next following the 
highest numbered claim previously presented (whether entered or not). 
When the application is ready for allowance, the examiner, if necessary, 
will renumber the claims consecutively in the order in which they appear 
or in such order as may have been requested by applicant.

                         Transitional Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1.129  Transitional procedures for limited examination after final rejection and restriction practice.

    (a) An applicant in an application, other than for reissue or a 
design patent, that has been pending for at least two years as of June 
8, 1995, taking into account any reference made in such application to 
any earlier filed application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 and 365(c), is 
entitled to have a first submission entered and considered on the merits 
after final rejection under the following circumstances: The Office will 
consider such a submission, if the first submission and the fee set 
forth in Sec. 1.17(r) are filed prior to the filing of an appeal brief 
and prior to abandonment of the application. The finality of the final 
rejection is automatically withdrawn upon the timely filing of the 
submission and payment of the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(r). If a 
subsequent final rejection is made in the application, applicant is 
entitled to have a second submission entered and considered on the 
merits after the subsequent final rejection under the following 
circumstances: The Office will consider such a submission, if the second 
submission and a second fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(r) are filed prior to 
the filing of an appeal brief and prior to abandonment of the 
application. The finality of the subsequent final rejection is 
automatically withdrawn upon the timely filing of the submission and 
payment of the second fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(r). Any submission 
filed after a final rejection made in an application subsequent to the 
fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(r) having been twice paid will be treated as 
set forth in Sec. 1.116. A submission as used in this paragraph 
includes, but is not limited

[[Page 81]]

to, an information disclosure statement, an amendment to the written 
description, claims or drawings and a new substantive argument or new 
evidence in support of patentability.
    (b)(1) In an application, other than for reissue or a design patent, 
that has been pending for at least three years as of June 8, 1995; 
taking into account any reference made in the application to any earlier 
filed application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, and 365(c), no requirement 
for restriction or for the filing of divisional applications shall be 
made or maintained in the application after June 8, 1995, except where:
    (i) The requirement was first made in the application or any earlier 
filed application under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 and 365(c) prior to April 8, 
1995;
    (ii) The examiner has not made a requirement for restriction in the 
present or parent application prior to April 8, 1995, due to actions by 
the applicant; or
    (iii) The required fee for examination of each additional invention 
was not paid.
    (2) If the application contains more than one independent and 
distinct invention and a requirement for restriction or for the filing 
of divisional applications cannot be made or maintained pursuant to this 
paragraph, applicant will be so notified and given a time period to:
    (i) Elect the invention or inventions to be searched and examined, 
if no election has been made prior to the notice, and pay the fee set 
forth in Sec. 1.17(s) for each independent and distinct invention 
claimed in the application in excess of one which applicant elects;
    (ii) Confirm an election made prior to the notice and pay the fee 
set forth in Sec. 1.17(s) for each independent and distinct invention 
claimed in the application in addition to the one invention which 
applicant previously elected; or
    (iii) File a petition under this section traversing the requirement. 
If the required petition is filed in a timely manner, the original time 
period for electing and paying the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(s) will be 
deferred and any decision on the petition affirming or modifying the 
requirement will set a new time period to elect the invention or 
inventions to be searched and examined and to pay the fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(s) for each independent and distinct invention claimed in the 
application in excess of one which applicant elects.
    (3) The additional inventions for which the required fee has not 
been paid will be withdrawn from consideration under Sec. 1.142(b). An 
applicant who desires examination of an invention so withdrawn from 
consideration can file a divisional application under 35 U.S.C. 121.
    (c) The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any 
application filed after June 8, 1995.

<R05>
Sec. 1.130  Affidavit or declaration to disqualify commonly owned patent or published application as prior art.

    (a) When any claim of an application or a patent under reexamination 
is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 on a U.S. patent or U.S. patent 
application publication which is not prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(b), 
and the inventions defined by the claims in the application or patent 
under reexamination and by the claims in the patent or published 
application are not identical but are not patentably distinct, and the 
inventions are owned by the same party, the applicant or owner of the 
patent under reexamination may disqualify the patent or patent 
application publication as prior art. The patent or patent application 
publication can be disqualified as prior art by submission of:
    (1) A terminal disclaimer in accordance with Sec. 1.321(c); and
    (2) An oath or declaration stating that the application or patent 
under reexamination and patent or published application are currently 
owned by the same party, and that the inventor named in the application 
or patent under reexamination is the prior inventor under 35 U.S.C. 104.
    (b) When an application or a patent under reexamination claims an 
invention which is not patentably distinct from an invention claimed in 
a commonly owned patent with the same or a different inventive entity, a 
double patenting rejection will be made in the

[[Page 82]]

application or a patent under reexamination. A judicially created double 
patenting rejection may be obviated by filing a terminal disclaimer in 
accordance with Sec. 1.321(c).

Sec. 1.131  Affidavit or declaration of prior invention.

    (a) When any claim of an application or a patent under reexamination 
is rejected, the inventor of the subject matter of the rejected claim, 
the owner of the patent under reexamination, or the party qualified 
under Secs. 1.42, 1.43, or 1.47, may submit an appropriate oath or 
declaration to establish invention of the subject matter of the rejected 
claim prior to the effective date of the reference or activity on which 
the rejection is based. The effective date of a U.S. patent, U.S. patent 
application publication, or international application publication under 
PCT Article 21(2) is the earlier of its publication date or date that it 
is effective as a reference under 35 U.S.C. 102(e). Prior invention may 
not be established under this section in any country other than the 
United States, a NAFTA country, or a WTO member country. Prior invention 
may not be established under this section before December 8, 1993, in a 
NAFTA country other than the United States, or before January 1, 1996, 
in a WTO member country other than a NAFTA country. Prior invention may 
not be established under this section if either:
    (1) The rejection is based upon a U.S. patent or U.S. patent 
application publication of a pending or patented application to another 
or others which claims the same patentable invention as defined in 
Sec. 1.601(n); or
    (2) The rejection is based upon a statutory bar.
    (b) The showing of facts shall be such, in character and weight, as 
to establish reduction to practice prior to the effective date of the 
reference, or conception of the invention prior to the effective date of 
the reference coupled with due diligence from prior to said date to a 
subsequent reduction to practice or to the filing of the application. 
Original exhibits of drawings or records, or photocopies thereof, must 
accompany and form part of the affidavit or declaration of their absence 
satisfactorily explained.

    (2) An interview for the discussion of the patentability of a 
pending application will not occur before the first Office action, 
unless the application is a continuing or substitute application.
    (3) The examiner may require that an interview be scheduled in 
advance.
    (b) In every instance where reconsideration is requested in view of 
an interview with an examiner, a complete written statement of the 
reasons presented at the interview as warranting favorable action must 
be filed by the applicant. An interview does not remove the necessity 
for reply to Office actions as specified in Secs. 1.111 and 1.135.

<R05>
Sec. 1.134  Time period for reply to an Office action.

    An Office action will notify the applicant of any non-statutory or 
shortened statutory time period set for reply to an Office action. 
Unless the applicant is notified in writing that a reply is required in 
less than six months, a maximum period of six months is allowed.

Sec. 1.135  Abandonment for failure to reply within time period.

    (a) If an applicant of a patent application fails to reply within 
the time period provided under Sec. 1.134 and Sec. 1.136, the 
application will become abandoned unless an Office action indicates 
otherwise.
    (b) Prosecution of an application to save it from abandonment 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must include such complete and 
proper reply as the condition of the application may require. The 
admission of, or refusal to admit, any amendment after final rejection 
or any amendment not responsive to the last action, or any related 
proceedings, will not operate to save the application from abandonment.
    (c) When reply by the applicant is a bona fide attempt to advance 
the application to final action, and is substantially a complete reply 
to the non-final Office action, but consideration of some matter or 
compliance with some requirement has been inadvertently omitted, 
applicant may be given a new time period for reply under Sec. 1.134 to 
supply the omission.

by statute or five months after the time period set for reply, if a 
petition for an extension of time and the fee set in Sec. 1.17(a) are

    (ii) The reply is a reply brief submitted pursuant to Sec. 1.193(b);
    (iii) The reply is a request for an oral hearing submitted pursuant 
to Sec. 1.194(b);
    (iv) The reply is to a decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences pursuant to Sec. 1.196, Sec. 1.197 or Sec. 1.304; or
    (v) The application is involved in an interference declared pursuant 
to Sec. 1.611.
    (2) The date on which the petition and the fee have been filed is 
the date for purposes of determining the period of extension and the 
corresponding amount of the fee. The expiration of the time period is 
determined by the amount of the fee paid. A reply must be filed prior to 
the expiration of the period of extension to avoid abandonment of the 
application (Sec. 1.135), but in no situation may an applicant reply 
later than the maximum time period set by statute, or be granted an 
extension of time under paragraph (b) of this section when the 
provisions of this paragraph are available. See Sec. 1.136(b) for 
extensions of time relating to proceedings pursuant to Secs. 1.193(b), 
1.194, 1.196 or 1.197; Sec. 1.304 for extensions of time to appeal to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or to commence a civil 
action; Sec. 1.550(c) for extensions of time in ex parte reexamination 
proceedings; Sec. 1.956 for extensions of time in inter partes 
reexamination proceedings; and Sec. 1.645 for extensions of time in 
interference proceedings.
    (3) A written request may be submitted in an application that is an 
authorization to treat any concurrent or future reply, requiring a 
petition for an extension of time under this paragraph for its timely 
submission, as incorporating a petition for extension of time for the 
appropriate length of time. An authorization to charge all required 
fees, fees under Sec. 1.17, or all required extension of time fees will 
be treated as a constructive petition for an extension of time in any 
concurrent or future reply requiring a petition for an extension of time 
under this paragraph for its timely submission. Submission of the fee 
set forth in Sec. 1.17(a) will also be treated as a constructive 
petition for an extension of time in any concurrent reply requiring a 
petition for an extension of time under this paragraph for its timely 
submission.

[[Page 84]]

    (b) When a reply cannot be filed within the time period set for such 
reply and the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section are not 
available, the period for reply will be extended only for sufficient 
cause and for a reasonable time specified. Any request for an extension 
of time under this paragraph must be filed on or before the day on which 
such reply is due, but the mere filing of such a request will not affect 
any extension under this paragraph. In no situation can any extension 
carry the date on which reply is due beyond the maximum time period set 
by statute. See Sec. 1.304 for extensions of time to appeal to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or to commence a civil action; 
Sec. 1.645 for extensions of time in interference proceedings; 
Sec. 1.550(c) for extensions of time in ex parte reexamination 
proceedings; and Sec. 1.956 for extensions of time in inter partes 
reexamination proceedings.
    (c) If an applicant is notified in a ``Notice of Allowability'' that 
an application is otherwise in condition for allowance, the following 
time periods are not extendable if set in the ``Notice of Allowability'' 
or in an Office action having a mail date on or after the mail date of 
the ``Notice of Allowability'':
    (1) The period for submitting an oath or declaration in compliance 
with Sec. 1.63;
    (2) The period for submitting formal drawings set under 
Sec. 1.85(c); and
    (3) The period for making a deposit set under Sec. 1.809(c).

Sec. 1.137  Revival of abandoned application, terminated reexamination proceeding, or lapsed patent.

    (a) Unavoidable. If the delay in reply by applicant or patent owner 
was unavoidable, a petition may be filed pursuant to this paragraph to 
revive an abandoned application, a reexamination proceeding terminated 
under Secs. 1.550(d) or 1.957(b) or (c), or a lapsed patent. A grantable 
petition pursuant to this paragraph must be accompanied by:
    (1) The reply required to the outstanding Office action or notice, 
unless previously filed;
    (2) The petition fee as set forth in Sec. 1.17(l);
    (3) A showing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the 
entire delay in filing the required reply from the due date for the 
reply until the filing of a grantable petition pursuant to this 
paragraph was unavoidable; and
    (4) Any terminal disclaimer (and fee as set forth in Sec. 1.20(d)) 
required pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) Unintentional. If the delay in reply by applicant or patent 
owner was unintentional, a petition may be filed pursuant to this 
paragraph to revive an abandoned application, a reexamination proceeding 
terminated under Secs. 1.550(d) or 1.957(b) or (c), or a lapsed patent. 
A grantable petition pursuant to this paragraph must be accompanied by:
    (1) The reply required to the outstanding Office action or notice, 
unless previously filed;
    (2) The petition fee as set forth in Sec. 1.17(m);
    (3) A statement that the entire delay in filing the required reply 
from the due date for the reply until the filing of a grantable petition 
pursuant to this paragraph was unintentional. The Commissioner may 
require additional information where there is a question whether the 
delay was unintentional; and
    (4) Any terminal disclaimer (and fee as set forth in Sec. 1.20(d)) 
required pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
    (c) Reply. In a nonprovisional application abandoned for failure to 
prosecute, the required reply may be met by the filing of a continuing 
application. In a nonprovisional utility or plant application filed on 
or after June 8, 1995, and abandoned for failure to prosecute, the 
required reply may also be met by the filing of a request for continued 
examination in compliance with Sec. 1.114. In an application or patent, 
abandoned or lapsed for failure to pay the issue fee or any portion 
thereof, the required reply must include payment of the issue fee or any 
outstanding balance. In an application, abandoned for failure to pay the 
publication fee, the required reply must include payment of the 
publication fee.
    (d) Terminal disclaimer. (1) Any petition to revive pursuant to this 
section

[[Page 85]]

in a design application must be accompanied by a terminal disclaimer and 
fee as set forth in Sec. 1.321 dedicating to the public a terminal part 
of the term of any patent granted thereon equivalent to the period of 
abandonment of the application. Any petition to revive pursuant to this 
section in either a utility or plant application filed before June 8, 
1995, must be accompanied by a terminal disclaimer and fee as set forth 
in Sec. 1.321 dedicating to the public a terminal part of the term of 
any patent granted thereon equivalent to the lesser of:
    (i) The period of abandonment of the application; or
    (ii) The period extending beyond twenty years from the date on which 
the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, if the 
application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed 
application(s) under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c), from the date on 
which the earliest such application was filed.
    (2) Any terminal disclaimer pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section must also apply to any patent granted on a continuing utility or 
plant application filed before June 8, 1995, or a continuing design 
application, that contains a specific reference under 35 U.S.C. 120, 
121, or 365(c) to the application for which revival is sought.
    (3) The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section do not apply 
to applications for which revival is sought solely for purposes of 
copendency with a utility or plant application filed on or after June 8, 
1995, to lapsed patents, or to reexamination proceedings.
    (e) Request for reconsideration. Any request for reconsideration or 
review of a decision refusing to revive an abandoned application, a 
terminated reexamination proceeding, or lapsed patent upon petition 
filed pursuant to this section, to be considered timely, must be filed 
within two months of the decision refusing to revive or within such time 
as set in the decision. Unless a decision indicates otherwise, this time 
period may be extended under:
    (1) The provisions of Sec. 1.136 for an abandoned application or 
lapsed patent;
    (2) The provisions of Sec. 1.550(c) for a terminated ex parte 
reexamination proceeding filed under Sec. 1.510; or
    (3) The provisions of Sec. 1.956 for a terminated inter partes 
reexamination proceeding filed under Sec. 1.913.
    (f) Abandonment for failure to notify the Office of a foreign 
filing: A nonprovisional application abandoned pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 
122(b)(2)(B)(iii) for failure to timely notify the Office of the filing 
of an application in a foreign country or under a multinational treaty 
that requires publication of applications eighteen months after filing, 
may be revived only pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The reply 
requirement of paragraph (c) of this section is met by the notification 
of such filing in a foreign country or under a multinational treaty, but 
the filing of a petition under this section will not operate to stay any 
period for reply that may be running against the application.
    (g) Provisional applications. A provisional application, abandoned 
for failure to timely respond to an Office requirement, may be revived 
pursuant to this section. Subject to the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 
119(e)(3) and Sec. 1.7(b), a provisional application will not be 
regarded as pending after twelve months from its filing date under any 
circumstances.

Sec. 1.138  Express abandonment.

    (a) An application may be expressly abandoned by filing a written 
declaration of abandonment identifying the application in the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office. Express abandonment of the 
application may not be recognized by the Office before the date of issue 
or publication unless it is actually received by appropriate officials 
in time to act.
    (b) A written declaration of abandonment must be signed by a party 
authorized under Sec. 1.33(b)(1), (b)(3), or (b)(4) to sign a paper in 
the application, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. A 
registered attorney or agent, not of record, who acts in a 
representative capacity under the provisions of Sec. 1.34(a) when filing 
a continuing application, may expressly abandon the prior application as 
of the

[[Page 86]]

filing date granted to the continuing application.
    (c) An applicant seeking to abandon an application to avoid 
publication of the application (see Sec. 1.211(a)(1)) must submit a 
declaration of express abandonment by way of a petition under this 
section including the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(h) in sufficient time 
to permit the appropriate officials to recognize the abandonment and 
remove the application from the publication process. Applicant should 
expect that the petition will not be granted and the application will be 
published in regular course unless such declaration of express 
abandonment and petition are received by the appropriate officials more 
than four weeks prior to the projected date of publication.

Sec. 1.139  [Reserved]

          Joinder of Inventions in One Application; Restriction

    Authority: Secs. 1.141 to 1.147 also issued under 35 U.S.C. 121.


<R05>
Sec. 1.141  Different inventions in one national application.

    (a) Two or more independent and distinct inventions may not be 
claimed in one national application, except that more than one species 
of an invention, not to exceed a reasonable number, may be specifically 
claimed in different claims in one national application, provided the 
application also includes an allowable claim generic to all the claimed 
species and all the claims to species in excess of one are written in 
dependent form (Sec. 1.75) or otherwise include all the limitations of 
the generic claim.
    (b) Where claims to all three categories, product, process of 
making, and process of use, are included in a national application, a 
three way requirement for restriction can only be made where the process 
of making is distinct from the product. If the process of making and the 
product are not distinct, the process of using may be joined with the 
claims directed to the product and the process of making the product 
even though a showing of distinctness between the product and process of 
using the product can be made.

[52 FR 20046, May 28, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 1.142  Requirement for restriction.

    (a) If two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed 
in a single application, the examiner in an Office action will require 
the applicant in the reply to that action to elect an invention to which 
the claims will be restricted, this official action being called a 
requirement for restriction (also known as a requirement for division). 
Such requirement will normally be made before any action on the merits; 
however, it may be made at any time before final action.
    (b) Claims to the invention or inventions not elected, if not 
canceled, are nevertheless withdrawn from further consideration by the 
examiner by the election, subject however to reinstatement in the event 
the requirement for restriction is withdrawn or overruled.

[24 FR 10332, Dec. 22, 1959, as amended at 62 FR 53195, Oct. 10, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1.143  Reconsideration of requirement.

    If the applicant disagrees with the requirement for restriction, he 
may request reconsideration and withdrawal or modification of the 
requirement, giving the reasons therefor. (See Sec. 1.111.) In 
requesting reconsideration the applicant must indicate a provisional 
election of one invention for prosecution, which invention shall be the 
one elected in the event the requirement becomes final The requirement 
for restriction will be reconsidered on such a request. If the 
requirement is repeated and made final the examiner will at the same 
time act on the claims to the invention elected.


<R05>
Sec. 1.144  Petition from requirement for restriction.

    After a final requirement for restriction, the applicant, in 
addition to making any reply due on the remainder of the action, may 
petition the Commissioner to review the requirement. Petition may be 
deferred until after final action on or allowance of claims to the 
invention elected, but must be filed not

[[Page 87]]

later than appeal. A petition will not be considered if reconsideration 
of the requirement was not requested (see Sec. 1.181).

[62 FR 53195, Oct. 10, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 1.145  Subsequent presentation of claims for different invention.

    If, after an office action on an application, the applicant presents 
claims directed to an invention distinct from and independent of the 
invention previously claimed, the applicant will be required to restrict 
the claims to the invention previously claimed if the amendment is 
entered, subject to reconsideration and review as provided in 
Secs. 1.143 and 1.144.


<R05>
Sec. 1.146  Election of species.

    In the first action on an application containing a generic claim to 
a generic invention (genus) and claims to more than one patentably 
distinct species embraced thereby, the examiner may require the 
applicant in the reply to that action to elect a species of his or her 
invention to which his or her claim will be restricted if no claim to 
the genus is found to be allowable. However, if such application 
contains claims directed to more than a reasonable number of species, 
the examiner may require restriction of the claims to not more than a 
reasonable number of species before taking further action in the 
application.

    (2) Drawings. Applicant must submit a clean copy of each drawing 
sheet of the printed patent at the time the reissue application is 
filed. If such copy complies with Sec. 1.84, no further drawings will be 
required. Where a drawing of the reissue application is to include any 
changes relative to the patent being reissued, the changes to the 
drawing must be made in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section. The Office will not transfer the drawings from the patent file 
to the reissue application.
    (b) Making amendments in a reissue application. An amendment in a 
reissue application is made either by physically incorporating the 
changes into the specification when the application is filed, or by a 
separate amendment paper. If amendment is made by incorporation, 
markings pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section must be used. If 
amendment is made by an amendment paper, the paper must direct that 
specified changes be made.
    (1) Specification other than the claims. Changes to the 
specification, other than to the claims, must be made by submission of 
the entire text of an added or rewritten paragraph, including markings 
pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except that an entire 
paragraph may be deleted by a statement deleting the paragraph without 
presentation of the text of the paragraph. The precise point in the 
specification must be identified where any added or rewritten paragraph 
is located. This paragraph applies whether the amendment is submitted on 
paper or compact disc (see Secs. 1.52(e)(1) and 1.821(c), but not for 
discs submitted under Sec. 1.821(e)).
    (2) Claims. An amendment paper must include the entire text of each 
claim being changed by such amendment paper and of each claim being 
added by such amendment paper. For any claim changed by the amendment 
paper, a parenthetical expression ``amended,'' ``twice amended,'' etc., 
should follow the claim number. Each changed patent claim and each added 
claim must include markings pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, 
except that a patent claim or added claim should be canceled by a 
statement canceling the claim without presentation of the text of the 
claim.
    (3) Drawings. Any change to the patent drawings must be submitted as 
a sketch on a separate paper showing the proposed changes in red for 
approval by the examiner. Upon approval by the examiner, new drawings in 
compliance with Sec. 1.84 including the approved changes must be filed. 
Amended figures must be identified as ``Amended,'' and any added figure 
must be identified as ``New.'' In the event that a figure is canceled, 
the figure must be surrounded by brackets and identified as 
``Canceled.''
    (c) Status of claims and support for claim changes. Whenever there 
is an amendment to the claims pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, 
there must also be supplied, on pages separate from the pages containing 
the changes, the status (i.e., pending or canceled), as of the date of 
the amendment, of all patent claims and of all added claims, and an 
explanation of the support in the disclosure of the patent for the 
changes made to the claims.
    (d) Changes shown by markings. Any changes relative to the patent 
being reissued which are made to the specification, including the 
claims, upon filing,

[[Page 91]]

or by an amendment paper in the reissue application, must include the 
following markings:
    (1) The matter to be omitted by reissue must be enclosed in 
brackets; and
    (2) The matter to be added by reissue must be underlined, except for 
amendments submitted on compact discs (Secs. 1.96 and 1.821(c)). Matter 
added by reissue on compact discs must be preceded with 
``<U<ls-thn-eq>'' and end with ``</U<ls-thn-eq>'' to properly identify 
the material being added.
    (e) Numbering of patent claims preserved. Patent claims may not be 
renumbered. The numbering of any claim added in the reissue application 
must follow the number of the highest numbered patent claim.
    (f) Amendment of disclosure may be required. The disclosure must be 
amended, when required by the Office, to correct inaccuracies of 
description and definition, and to secure substantial correspondence 
between the claims, the remainder of the specification, and the 
drawings.
    (g) Amendments made relative to the patent. All amendments must be 
made relative to the patent specification, including the claims, and 
drawings, which are in effect as of the date of filing of the reissue 
application.

<R05>
Sec. 1.175  Reissue oath or declaration.

    (a) The reissue oath or declaration in addition to complying with 
the requirements of Sec. 1.63, must also state that:
    (1) The applicant believes the original patent to be wholly or 
partly inoperative or invalid by reason of a defective specification or 
drawing, or by reason of the patentee claiming more or less than the 
patentee had the right to claim in the patent, stating at least one 
error being relied upon as the basis for reissue; and
    (2) All errors being corrected in the reissue application up to the 
time of filing of the oath or declaration under this paragraph arose 
without any deceptive intention on the part of the applicant.
    (b)(1) For any error corrected, which is not covered by the oath or 
declaration submitted under paragraph (a) of this section, applicant 
must submit a supplemental oath or declaration stating that every such 
error arose without any deceptive intention on the part of the 
applicant. Any supplemental oath or declaration required by this 
paragraph must be submitted before allowance and may be submitted:
    (i) With any amendment prior to allowance; or
    (ii) In order to overcome a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 251 made by 
the examiner where it is indicated that the submission of a supplemental 
oath or declaration as required by this paragraph will overcome the 
rejection.
    (2) For any error sought to be corrected after allowance, a 
supplemental oath or declaration must accompany the requested correction 
stating that the error(s) to be corrected arose without any deceptive 
intention on the part of the applicant.
    (c) Having once stated an error upon which the reissue is based, as 
set forth in paragraph (a)(1), unless all errors previously stated in 
the oath or declaration are no longer being corrected, a subsequent oath 
or declaration under paragraph (b) of this section need not specifically 
identify any other error or errors being corrected.
    (d) The oath or declaration required by paragraph (a) of this 
section may be submitted under the provisions of Sec. 1.53(f).

Sec. 1.176  Examination of reissue.

    (a) A reissue application will be examined in the same manner as a 
non-reissue, non-provisional application, and will be subject to all the 
requirements of the rules related to non-reissue applications. 
Applications for reissue will be acted on by the examiner in advance of 
other applications.
    (b) Restriction between subject matter of the original patent claims 
and previously unclaimed subject matter may be required (restriction 
involving only subject matter of the original patent claims will not be 
required). If restriction is required, the subject matter of the 
original patent claims will be held to be constructively elected unless 
a disclaimer of all the patent claims is filed in the reissue 
application, which

disclaimer cannot be withdrawn by applicant.

<R05>
Sec. 1.177  Issuance of multiple reissue patents.

    (a) The Office may reissue a patent as multiple reissue patents. If 
applicant files more than one application for the reissue of a single 
patent, each such application must contain or be amended to contain in 
the first sentence of the specification a notice stating that more than 
one reissue application has been filed and identifying each of the 
reissue applications by relationship, application number and filing 
date. The Office may correct by certificate of correction under 
Sec. 1.322 any reissue patent resulting from an application to which 
this paragraph applies that does not contain the required notice.
    (b) If applicant files more than one application for the reissue of 
a single patent, each claim of the patent being reissued must be 
presented in each of the reissue applications as an amended, unamended, 
or canceled (shown in brackets) claim, with each such claim bearing the 
same number as in the patent being reissued. The same claim of the 
patent being reissued may not be presented in its original unamended 
form for examination in more than one of such multiple reissue 
applications. The numbering of any added claims in any of the multiple 
reissue applications must follow the number of the highest numbered 
original patent claim.
    (c) If any one of the several reissue applications by itself fails 
to correct an error in the original patent as required by 35 U.S.C. 251 
but is otherwise in condition for allowance, the Office may suspend 
action in the allowable application until all issues are resolved as to 
at least one of the remaining reissue applications. The Office may also 
merge two or more of the multiple reissue applications into a single 
reissue application. No reissue application containing only unamended 
patent claims and not correcting an error in the original patent will be 
passed to issue by itself.

Sec. 1.178  Original patent; continuing duty of applicant.

    (a) The application for a reissue should be accompanied by either an 
offer to surrender the original patent, or the original patent itself, 
or if the original is lost or inaccessible, by a statement to that 
effect. The application may be accepted for examination in the absence 
of the original patent or the statement, but one or the other must be 
supplied before the application is allowed. If a reissue application is 
refused, the original patent, if surrendered, will be returned to 
applicant upon request.
    (b) In any reissue application before the Office, the applicant must 
call to the attention of the Office any prior or concurrent proceedings 
in which the patent (for which reissue is requested) is or was involved, 
such as interferences, reissues, reexaminations, or litigations and the 
results of such proceedings (see also Sec. 1.173(a)(1)).

Sec. 1.179  Notice of reissue application.

    When an application for a reissue is filed, there will be placed in 
the file of the original patent a notice stating that an application for 
reissue has been filed. When the reissue is granted or the reissue 
application is otherwise terminated, the fact will be added to the 
notice in the file of the original patent.

<R05>
Sec. 1.181  Petition to the Commissioner.

    (a) Petition may be taken to the Commissioner:
    (1) From any action or requirement of any examiner in the ex parte 
prosecution of an application, or in the ex parte or inter partes 
prosecution of a reexamination proceeding which is not subject to appeal 
to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or to the court;
    (2) In cases in which a statute or the rules specify that the matter 
is to be determined directly by or reviewed by the Commissioner; and

[[Page 93]]

    (3) To invoke the supervisory authority of the Commissioner in 
appropriate circumstances. For petitions in interferences, see 
Sec. 1.644.
    (b) Any such petition must contain a statement of the facts involved 
and the point or points to be reviewed and the action requested. Briefs 
or memoranda, if any, in support thereof should accompany or be embodied 
in the petition; and where facts are to be proven, the proof in the form 
of affidavits or declarations (and exhibits, if any) must accompany the 
petition.
    (c) When a petition is taken from an action or requirement of an 
examiner in the ex parte prosecution of an application, or in the ex 
parte or inter partes prosecution of a reexamination proceeding, it may 
be required that there have been a proper request for reconsideration 
(Sec. 1.111) and a repeated action by the examiner. The examiner may be 
directed by the Commissioner to furnish a written statement, within a 
specified time, setting forth the reasons for his or her decision upon 
the matters averred in the petition, supplying a copy to the petitioner.
    (d) Where a fee is required for a petition to the Commissioner the 
appropriate section of this part will so indicate. If any required fee 
does not accompany the petition, the petition will be dismissed.
    (e) Oral hearing will not be granted except when considered 
necessary by the Commissioner.
    (f) The mere filing of a petition will not stay any period for reply 
that may be running against the application, nor act as a stay of other 
proceedings. Any petition under this part not filed within two months of 
the mailing date of the action or notice from which relief is requested 
may be dismissed as untimely, except as otherwise provided. This two-
month period is not extendable.
    (g) The Commissioner may delegate to appropriate Patent and 
Trademark Office officials the determination of petitions.

         Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences

    Authority: Secs. 1.191 to 1.198 also issued under 35 U.S.C. 134.


<R05>
Sec. 1.191  Appeal to Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.

    (a) Every applicant for a patent or for reissue of a patent, and 
every owner of a patent under ex parte reexamination filed under 
Sec. 1.510 for a patent that issued from an original application filed 
in the United States before November 29, 1999, any of whose claims has 
been twice or finally (Sec. 1.113) rejected, may appeal from the 
decision of the examiner to the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences by filing a notice of appeal and the fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(b) within the time period provided under Secs. 1.134 and 1.136 
for reply. Notwithstanding the above, for an ex parte reexamination 
proceeding filed under Sec. 1.510 for a patent that issued from an

[[Page 94]]

original application filed in the United States on or after November 29, 
1999, no appeal may be filed until the claims have been finally rejected 
(Sec. 1.113). Appeals to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences 
in inter partes reexamination proceedings filed under Sec. 1.913 are 
controlled by Secs. 1.959 through 1.981. Sections 1.191 through 1.198 
are not applicable to appeals in inter partes reexamination proceedings 
filed under Sec. 1.913.
    (b) The signature requirement of Sec. 1.33 does not apply to a 
notice of appeal filed under this section.
    (c) An appeal when taken must be taken from the rejection of all 
claims under rejection which the applicant or patent owner proposes to 
contest. Questions relating to matters not affecting the merits of the 
invention may be required to be settled before an appeal can be 
considered.
    (d) The time periods set forth in Secs. 1.191 and 1.192 are subject 
to the provisions of Sec. 1.136 for patent applications and 
Sec. 1.550(c) for reexamination proceedings. The time periods set forth 
in Secs. 1.193, 1.194, 1.196 and 1.197 are subject to the provisions of 
Sec. 1.136(b) for patent applications or Sec. 1.550(c) for reexamination 
proceedings. See Sec. 1.304(a) for extensions of time for filing a 
notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or 
for commencing a civil action.
    (e) Jurisdiction over the application or patent under reexamination 
passes to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences upon transmittal 
of the file, including all briefs and examiner's answers, to the Board. 
Prior to the entry of a decision on the appeal, the Commissioner may sua 
sponte order the application remanded to the examiner.

Sec. 1.192  Appellant's brief.

    (a) Appellant must, within two months from the date of the notice of 
appeal under Sec. 1.191 or within the time allowed for reply to the 
action from which the appeal was taken, if such time is later, file a 
brief in triplicate. The brief must be accompanied by the fee set forth 
in Sec. 1.17(c) and must set forth the authorities and arguments on 
which appellant will rely to maintain the appeal. Any arguments or 
authorities not included in the brief will be refused consideration by 
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, unless good cause is 
shown.
    (b) On failure to file the brief, accompanied by the requisite fee, 
within the time allowed, the appeal shall stand dismissed.
    (c) The brief shall contain the following items under appropriate 
headings and in the order indicated below unless the brief is filed by 
an applicant who is not represented by a registered practitioner:
    (1) Real party in interest. A statement identifying the real party 
in interest, if the party named in the caption of the brief is not the 
real party in interest.
    (2) Related appeals and interferences. A Statement identifying by 
number and filing date all other appeals or interferences known to 
appellant, the appellant's legal representative, or assignee which will 
directly affect or be directly affected by or have a bearing on the 
Board's decision in the pending appeal.
    (3) Status of claims. A statement of the status of all the claims, 
pending or cancelled, and identifying the claims appealed.
    (4) Status of amendments. A statement of the status of any amendment 
filed subsequent to final rejection.
    (5) Summary of invention. A concise explanation of the invention 
defined in the claims involved in the appeal, which shall refer to the 
specification by page and line number, and to the drawing, if any, by 
reference characters.
    (6) Issues. A concise statement of the issues presented for review.
    (7) Grouping of claims. For each ground of rejection which appellant 
contests and which applies to a group of two or more claims, the Board 
shall select a single claim from the group and shall decide the appeal 
as to the ground of rejection on the basis of that claim alone unless a 
statement is included that the claims of the group do not stand or fall 
together and, in the

[[Page 95]]

argument under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, appellant explains why 
the claims of the group are believed to be separately patentable. Merely 
pointing out differences in what the claims cover is not an argument as 
to why the claims are separately patentable.
    (8) Argument. The contentions of appellant with respect to each of 
the issues presented for review in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, and 
the basis therefor, with citations of the authorities, statutes, and 
parts of the record relied on. Each issue should be treated under a 
separate heading.
    (i) For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, the 
argument shall specify the errors in the rejection and how the first 
paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 is complied with, including, as appropriate, 
how the specification and drawings, if any,
    (A) Describe the subject matter defined by each of the rejected 
claims,
    (B) Enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the subject 
matter defined by each of the rejected claims, and
    (C) Set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying 
out his or her invention.
    (ii) For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, the 
argument shall specify the errors in the rejection and how the claims 
particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which 
applicant regards as the invention.
    (iii) For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102, the argument shall 
specify the errors in the rejection and why the rejected claims are 
patentable under 35 U.S.C. 102, including any specific limitations in 
the rejected claims which are not described in the prior art relied upon 
in the rejection.
    (iv) For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103, the argument shall 
specify the errors in the rejection and, if appropriate, the specific 
limitations in the rejected claims which are not described in the prior 
art relied on in the rejection, and shall explain how such limitations 
render the claimed subject matter unobvious over the prior art. If the 
rejection is based upon a combination of references, the argument shall 
explain why the references, taken as a whole, do not suggest the claimed 
subject matter, and shall include, as may be appropriate, an explanation 
of why features disclosed in one reference may not properly be combined 
with features disclosed in another reference. A general argument that 
all the limitations are not described in a single reference does not 
satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.
    (v) For any rejection other than those referred to in paragraphs 
(c)(8) (i) to (iv) of this section, the argument shall specify the 
errors in the rejection and the specific limitations in the rejected 
claims, if appropriate, or other reasons, which cause the rejection to 
be in error.
    (9) Appendix. An appendix containing a copy of the claims involved 
in the appeal.
    (d) If a brief is filed which does not comply with all the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, appellant will be 
notified of the reasons for non-compliance and provided with a period of 
one month within which to file an amended brief. If appellant does not 
file an amended brief during the one-month period, or files an amended 
brief which does not overcome all the reasons for non-compliance stated 
in the notification, the appeal will stand dismissed.

Sec. 1.193  Examiner's answer and reply brief.

    (a)(1) The primary examiner may, within such time as may be directed 
by the Commissioner, furnish a written statement in answer to 
appellant's brief including such explanation of the invention claimed 
and of the references and grounds of rejection as may be necessary, 
supplying a copy to appellant. If the primary examiner finds that the 
appeal is not regular in form or does not relate to an appealable 
action, the primary examiner shall so state.
    (2) An examiner's answer must not include a new ground of rejection, 
but if an amendment under Sec. 1.116 proposes to add or amend one or 
more claims and appellant was advised that the

[[Page 96]]

amendment under Sec. 1.116 would be entered for purposes of appeal and 
which individual rejection(s) set forth in the action from which the 
appeal was taken would be used to reject the added or amended claim(s), 
then the appeal brief must address the rejection(s) of the claim(s) 
added or amended by the amendment under Sec. 1.116 as appellant was so 
advised and the examiner's answer may include the rejection(s) of the 
claim(s) added or amended by the amendment under Sec. 1.116 as appellant 
was so advised. The filing of an amendment under Sec. 1.116 which is 
entered for purposes of appeal represents appellant's consent that when 
so advised any appeal proceed on those claim(s) added or amended by the 
amendment under Sec. 1.116 subject to any rejection set forth in the 
action from which the appeal was taken.
    (b)(1) Appellant may file a reply brief to an examiner's answer or a 
supplemental examiner's answer within two months from the date of such 
examiner's answer or supplemental examiner's answer. See Sec. 1.136(b) 
for extensions of time for filing a reply brief in a patent application 
and Sec. 1.550(c) for extensions of time for filing a reply brief in a 
reexamination proceeding. The primary examiner must either acknowledge 
receipt and entry of the reply brief or withdraw the final rejection and 
reopen prosecution to respond to the reply brief. A supplemental 
examiner's answer is not permitted, unless the application has been 
remanded by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences for such 
purpose.
    (2) Where prosecution is reopened by the primary examiner after an 
appeal or reply brief has been filed, appellant must exercise one of the 
following two options to avoid abandonment of the application:
    (i) File a reply under Sec. 1.111, if the Office action is not 
final, or a reply under Sec. 1.113, if the Office action is final; or
    (ii) Request reinstatement of the appeal. If reinstatement of the 
appeal is requested, such request must be accompanied by a supplemental 
appeal brief, but no new amendments, affidavits (Secs. 1.130, 1.131 or 
1.132) or other evidence are permitted.

Sec. 1.194  Oral hearing.

    (a) An oral hearing should be requested only in those circumstances 
in which appellant considers such a hearing necessary or desirable for a 
proper presentation of the appeal. An appeal decided without an oral 
hearing will receive the same consideration by the Board of Patent 
Appeals and Interferences as appeals decided after oral hearing.
    (b) If appellant desires an oral hearing, appellant must file, in a 
separate paper, a written request for such hearing accompanied by the 
fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(d) within two months from the date of the 
examiner's answer. If appellant requests an oral hearing and submits 
therewith the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(d), an oral argument may be 
presented by, or on behalf of, the primary examiner if considered 
desirable by either the primary examiner or the Board. See Sec. 1.136(b) 
for extensions of time for requesting an oral hearing in a patent 
application and Sec. 1.550(c) for extensions of time for requesting an 
oral hearing in a reexamination proceeding.
    (c) If no request and fee for oral hearing have been timely filed by 
appellant, the appeal will be assigned for consideration and decision. 
If appellant has requested an oral hearing and has submitted the fee set 
forth in Sec. 1.17(d), a day of hearing will be set, and due notice 
thereof given to appellant and to the primary examiner. A hearing will 
be held as stated in the notice, and oral argument will be limited to 
twenty minutes for appellant and fifteen minutes for the primary 
examiner unless otherwise ordered before the hearing begins. If the 
Board decides that a hearing is not necessary, the Board will so notify 
appellant.

<R05>
Sec. 1.196  Decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.

    (a) The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, in its decision, 
may affirm or reverse the decision of the examiner in whole or in part 
on the grounds and on the claims specified by the examiner or remand the 
application to the examiner for further consideration. The affirmance of 
the rejection of a claim on any of the grounds specified constitutes a 
general affirmance of the decision of the examiner on that claim, except 
as to any ground specifically reversed.
    (b) Should the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences have 
knowledge of any grounds not involved in the appeal for rejecting any 
pending claim, it may include in the decision a statement to that effect 
with its reasons for so holding, which statement constitutes a new 
ground of rejection of the claim. A new ground of rejection shall not be 
considered final for purposes of judicial review. When the Board of 
Patent Appeals and Interferences makes a new ground of rejection, the 
appellant, within two months from the date of the decision, must 
exercise one of the following two options with respect to the new ground 
of rejection to avoid termination of proceedings (Sec. 1.197(c)) as to 
the rejected claims:
    (1) Submit an appropriate amendment of the claims so rejected or a 
showing of facts relating to the claims so rejected, or both, and have 
the matter reconsidered by the examiner, in which event the application 
will be remanded to the examiner. The new ground of rejection is binding 
upon the examiner unless an amendment or showing of facts not previously 
of record be made which, in the opinion of the examiner, overcomes the 
new ground of rejection stated in the decision. Should the examiner 
reject the claims, appellant may again appeal pursuant to Secs. 1.191 
through 1.195 to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.
    (2) Request that the application be reheard under Sec. 1.197(b) by 
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences upon the same record. The 
request for rehearing must address the new ground of rejection and state 
with particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or 
overlooked in rendering the decision and also state all other grounds 
upon which rehearing is sought. Where request for such rehearing is 
made, the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences shall rehear the new 
ground of rejection and, if necessary, render a new decision which shall 
include all grounds of rejection upon which a patent is refused. The 
decision on rehearing is deemed to incorporate the earlier decision for 
purposes of appeal, except for those portions specifically withdrawn on 
rehearing, and is final for the purpose of judicial review, except when 
noted otherwise in the decision.
    (c) Should the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences include an explicit statement that a claim may be allowed 
in amended form, appellant shall have the right to amend in conformity 
with such statement which shall be binding on the examiner in the 
absence of new references or grounds of rejection.
    (d) The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences may require 
appellant to address any matter that is deemed appropriate for a 
reasoned decision on the pending appeal. Appellant will be given a non-
extendable time period within which to respond to such a requirement.
    (e) Whenever a decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences includes or allows a remand, that decision shall not be 
considered a final decision. When appropriate, upon conclusion of 
proceedings on remand before the examiner, the Board of Patent Appeals 
and Interferences may enter an order otherwise making its decision 
final.
    (f) See Sec. 1.136(b) for extensions of time to take action under 
this section in a patent application and Sec. 1.550(c) for extensions of 
time in a reexamination proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 1.197  Action following decision.

    (a) After decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, 
the application will be returned to the examiner, subject to appellant's 
right of

[[Page 98]]

appeal or other review, for such further action by appellant or by the 
examiner, as the condition of the application may require, to carry into 
effect the decision.
    (b) Appellant may file a single request for rehearing within two 
months from the date of the original decision, unless the original 
decision is so modified by the decision on rehearing as to become, in 
effect, a new decision, and the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences so states. The request for rehearing must state with 
particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or 
overlooked in rendering the decision and also state all other grounds 
upon which rehearing is sought. See Sec. 1.136(b) for extensions of time 
for seeking rehearing in a patent application and Sec. 1.550(c) for 
extensions of time for seeking rehearing in a reexamination proceeding.
    (c) Termination of proceedings. Proceedings are considered 
terminated by the dismissal of an appeal or the failure to timely file 
an appeal to the court or a civil action (Sec. 1.304) except:
    (1) Where claims stand allowed in an application or
    (2) Where the nature of the decision requires further action by the 
examiner.

The date of termination of proceedings is the date on which the appeal 
is dismissed or the date on which the time for appeal to the court or 
review by civil action (Sec. 1.304) expires. If an appeal to the court 
or a civil action has been filed, proceedings are considered terminated 
when the appeal or civil action is terminated. An appeal to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is terminated when the mandate 
is received by the Office. A civil action is terminated when the time to 
appeal the judgment expires.

                       Publication of Applications

    Source: 65 FR 57058, Sept. 20, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.211  Publication of applications.

    (a) Each U.S. national application for patent filed in the Office 
under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) and each international application in compliance 
with 35 U.S.C. 371 will be published promptly after the expiration of a 
period of eighteen months from the earliest filing date for which a 
benefit is sought under title 35, United States Code, unless:
    (1) The application is recognized by the Office as no longer 
pending;
    (2) The application is national security classified (see 
Sec. 5.2(c)), subject to a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181, or under 
national security review;
    (3) The application has issued as a patent in sufficient time to be 
removed from the publication process; or
    (4) The application was filed with a nonpublication request in 
compliance with Sec. 1.213(a).
    (b) Provisional applications under 35 U.S.C. 111(b) shall not be 
published, and design applications under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16 and 
reissue applications under 35 U.S.C. chapter 25 shall not be published 
under this section.
    (c) An application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) will not be 
published until it includes the basic filing fee (Sec. 1.16(a)

[[Page 99]]

or 1.16(g)), any English translation required by Sec. 1.52(d), and an 
executed oath or declaration under Sec. 1.63. The Office may delay 
publishing any application until it includes a specification having 
papers in compliance with Sec. 1.52 and an abstract (Sec. 1.72(b)), 
drawings in compliance with Sec. 1.84, and a sequence listing in 
compliance with Secs. 1.821 through 1.825 (if applicable), and until any 
petition under Sec. 1.47 is granted.
    (d) The Office may refuse to publish an application, or to include a 
portion of an application in the patent application publication 
(Sec. 1.215), if publication of the application or portion thereof would 
violate Federal or state law, or if the application or portion thereof 
contains offensive or disparaging material.
    (e) The publication fee set forth in Sec. 1.18(d) must be paid in 
each application published under this section before the patent will be 
granted. If an application is subject to publication under this section, 
the sum specified in the notice of allowance under Sec. 1.311 will also 
include the publication fee which must be paid within three months from 
the date of mailing of the notice of allowance to avoid abandonment of 
the application. This three-month period is not extendable. If the 
application is not published under this section, the publication fee (if 
paid) will be refunded.


<R05>
Sec. 1.213  Nonpublication request.

    (a) If the invention disclosed in an application has not been and 
will not be the subject of an application filed in another country, or 
under a multilateral international agreement, that requires publication 
of applications eighteen months after filing, the application will not 
be published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) and Sec. 1.211 provided:
    (1) A request (nonpublication request) is submitted with the 
application upon filing;
    (2) The request states in a conspicuous manner that the application 
is not to be published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b);
    (3) The request contains a certification that the invention 
disclosed in the application has not been and will not be the subject of 
an application filed in another country, or under a multilateral 
international agreement, that requires publication at eighteen months 
after filing; and
    (4) The request is signed in compliance with Sec. 1.33(b).
    (b) The applicant may rescind a nonpublication request at any time. 
A request to rescind a nonpublication request under paragraph (a) of 
this section must:
    (1) Identify the application to which it is directed;
    (2) State in a conspicuous manner that the request that the 
application is not to be published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) is rescinded; 
and
    (3) Be signed in compliance with Sec. 1.33(b).
    (c) If an applicant who has submitted a nonpublication request under 
paragraph (a) of this section subsequently files an application directed 
to the invention disclosed in the application in which the 
nonpublication request was submitted in another country, or under a 
multilateral international agreement, that requires publication of 
applications eighteen months after filing, the applicant must notify the 
Office of such filing within forty-five days after the date of the 
filing of such foreign or international application. The failure to 
timely notify the Office of the filing of such foreign or international 
application shall result in abandonment of the application in which the 
nonpublication request was submitted (35 U.S.C. 122(b)(2)(B)(iii)).


<R05>
Sec. 1.215  Patent application publication.

    (a) The publication of an application under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) shall 
include a patent application publication. The date of publication shall 
be indicated on the patent application publication. The patent 
application publication will be based upon the application papers 
deposited on the filing date of the application, as well as the executed 
oath or declaration submitted to complete the application, and any 
application papers or drawings submitted in reply to a preexamination 
notice requiring a title and abstract in compliance with Sec. 1.72, 
application papers in compliance with Sec. 1.52, drawings in compliance 
with Sec. 1.84, or a sequence listing in compliance with Secs. 1.821 
through 1.825, except as otherwise provided in this

[[Page 100]]

section. The patent application publication will not include any 
amendments, including preliminary amendments, unless applicant supplies 
a copy of the application containing the amendment pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (b) If applicant wants the patent application publication to include 
assignee information, the applicant must include the assignee 
information on the application transmittal sheet or the application data 
sheet (Sec. 1.76). Assignee information may not be included on the 
patent application publication unless this information is provided on 
the application transmittal sheet or application data sheet included 
with the application on filing. Providing this information on the 
application transmittal sheet or the application data sheet does not 
substitute for compliance with any requirement of part 3 of this chapter 
to have an assignment recorded by the Office.
    (c) At applicant's option, the patent application publication will 
be based upon the copy of the application (specification, drawings, and 
oath or declaration) as amended during examination, provided that 
applicant supplies such a copy in compliance with the Office electronic 
filing system requirements within one month of the actual filing date of 
the application or fourteen months of the earliest filing date for which 
a benefit is sought under title 35, United States Code, whichever is 
later.
    (d) If the copy of the application submitted pursuant to paragraph 
(c) of this section does not comply with the Office electronic filing 
system requirements, the Office will publish the application as provided 
in paragraph (a) of this section. If, however, the Office has not 
started the publication process, the Office may use an untimely filed 
copy of the application supplied by the applicant under paragraph (c) of 
this section in creating the patent application publication.


<R05>
Sec. 1.217  Publication of a redacted copy of an application.

    (a) If an applicant has filed applications in one or more foreign 
countries, directly or through a multilateral international agreement, 
and such foreign-filed applications or the description of the invention 
in such foreign-filed applications is less extensive than the 
application or description of the invention in the application filed in 
the Office, the applicant may submit a redacted copy of the application 
filed in the Office for publication, eliminating any part or description 
of the invention that is not also contained in any of the corresponding 
applications filed in a foreign country. The Office will publish the 
application as provided in Sec. 1.215(a) unless the applicant files a 
redacted copy of the application in compliance with this section within 
sixteen months after the earliest filing date for which a benefit is 
sought under title 35, United States Code.
    (b) The redacted copy of the application must be submitted in 
compliance with the Office electronic filing system requirements. The 
title of the invention in the redacted copy of the application must 
correspond to the title of the application at the time the redacted copy 
of the application is submitted to the Office. If the redacted copy of 
the application does not comply with the Office electronic filing system 
requirements, the Office will publish the application as provided in 
Sec. 1.215(a).
    (c) The applicant must also concurrently submit in paper 
(Sec. 1.52(a)) to be filed in the application:
    (1) A certified copy of each foreign-filed application that 
corresponds to the application for which a redacted copy is submitted;
    (2) A translation of each such foreign-filed application that is in 
a language other than English, and a statement that the translation is 
accurate;
    (3) A marked-up copy of the application showing the redactions in 
brackets; and
    (4) A certification that the redacted copy of the application 
eliminates only the part or description of the invention that is not 
contained in any application filed in a foreign country, directly or 
through a multilateral international agreement, that corresponds to the 
application filed in the Office.
    (d) The Office will provide a copy of the complete file wrapper and 
contents of an application for which a redacted copy was submitted under 
this section

[[Page 101]]

to any person upon written request pursuant to Sec. 1.14(c)(2), unless 
applicant complies with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), 
and (d)(3) of this section.
    (1) Applicant must accompany the submission required by paragraph 
(c) of this section with the following:
    (i) A copy of any Office correspondence previously received by 
applicant including any desired redactions, and a second copy of all 
Office correspondence previously received by applicant showing the 
redacted material in brackets; and
    (ii) A copy of each submission previously filed by the applicant 
including any desired redactions, and a second copy of each submission 
previously filed by the applicant showing the redacted material in 
brackets.
    (2) In addition to providing the submission required by paragraphs 
(c) and (d)(1) of this section, applicant must:
    (i) Within one month of the date of mailing of any correspondence 
from the Office, file a copy of such Office correspondence including any 
desired redactions, and a second copy of such Office correspondence 
showing the redacted material in brackets; and
    (ii) With each submission by the applicant, include a copy of such 
submission including any desired redactions, and a second copy of such 
submission showing the redacted material in brackets.
    (3) Each submission under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this 
paragraph must also be accompanied by the processing fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(i) and a certification that the redactions are limited to the 
elimination of material that is relevant only to the part or description 
of the invention that was not contained in the redacted copy of the 
application submitted for publication.
    (e) The provisions of Sec. 1.8 do not apply to the time periods set 
forth in this section.


<R05>
Sec. 1.219  Early publication.

    Applications that will be published under Sec. 1.211 may be 
published earlier than as set forth in Sec. 1.211(a) at the request of 
the applicant. Any request for early publication must be accompanied by 
the publication fee set forth in Sec. 1.18(d). If the applicant does not 
submit a copy of the application in compliance with the Office 
electronic filing system requirements pursuant to Sec. 1.215(c), the 
Office will publish the application as provided in Sec. 1.215(a). No 
consideration will be given to requests for publication on a certain 
date, and such requests will be treated as a request for publication as 
soon as possible.


<R05>
Sec. 1.221  Voluntary publication or republication of patent application publication.

    (a) Any request for publication of an application filed before, but 
pending on, November 29, 2000, and any request for republication of an 
application previously published under Sec. 1.211, must include a copy 
of the application in compliance with the Office electronic filing 
system requirements and be accompanied by the publication fee set forth 
in Sec. 1.18(d) and the processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(i). If the 
request does not comply with the requirements of this paragraph or the 
copy of the application does not comply with the Office electronic 
filing system requirements, the Office will not publish the application 
and will refund the publication fee.
    (b) The Office will grant a request for a corrected or revised 
patent application publication other than as provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section only when the Office makes a material mistake which is 
apparent from Office records. Any request for a corrected or revised 
patent application publication other than as provided in paragraph (a) 
of this section must be filed within two months from the date of the 
patent application publication. This period is not extendable.

                        Miscellaneous Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 1.248  Service of papers; manner of service; proof of service in cases other than interferences.

    (a) Service of papers must be on the attorney or agent of the party

other proceeding that is not among applicant's or patentee's records.
    (2) Applicant or patentee may comply with a notice under this 
section by:

                   Protests and Public Use Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 1.291  Protests by the public against pending applications.

    (a) Protests by a member of the public against pending applications 
will be referred to the examiner having charge of the subject matter 
involved. A protest specifically identifying the application to which 
the protest is directed will be entered in the application file if:
    (1) The protest is submitted prior to the date the application was 
published or the mailing of a notice of allowance under Sec. 1.311, 
whichever occurs first; and
    (2) The protest is either served upon the applicant in accordance 
with Sec. 1.248, or filed with the Office in duplicate in the event 
service is not possible.
    (b) Protests raising fraud or other inequitable conduct issues will 
be entered in the application file, generally without comment on those 
issues. Protests which do not adequately identify a pending patent 
application will be returned to the protestor and will not be further 
considered by the Office. A protest submitted in accordance with the 
second sentence of paragraph (a) of this section will be considered by 
the Office if the application is still pending when the protest and 
application file are brought before the examiner and it includes:
    (1) A listing of the patents, publications, or other information 
relied upon;
    (2) A concise explanation of the relevance of each listed item;
    (3) A copy of each listed patent or publication or other item of 
information in written form or at least the pertinent portions thereof; 
and
    (4) An English language translation of all the necessary and 
pertinent parts of any non-English language patent, publication, or 
other item of information in written form relied upon.
    (c) A member of the public filing a protest in an application under 
paragraph (a) of this section will not receive any communications from 
the Office relating to the protest, other than the return of a self-
addressed postcard which the member of the public may include with the 
protest in order to receive an acknowledgment by the Office that the 
protest has been received. In the absence of a request by the Office, an 
applicant has no duty to, and need not, reply to a protest. The limited 
involvement of the member of the public filing a protest pursuant to 
paragraph (a) of this section ends with the filing of the protest, and 
no further submission on behalf of the protestor will be considered, 
except for additional prior art, or unless such submission raises new 
issues which could not have been earlier presented.

<R05>
Sec. 1.292  Public use proceedings.

    (a) When a petition for the institution of public use proceedings, 
supported by affidavits or declarations is found, on reference to the 
examiner, to make a prima facie showing that the invention claimed in an 
application believed to be on file had been in public use or on sale 
more than one year before the filing of the application, a hearing may 
be had before the Commissioner to determine whether a public use 
proceeding should be instituted. If instituted, the Commissioner may 
designate an appropriate official to conduct the public use proceeding,

Sec. 1.293  Statutory invention registration.

    (a) An applicant for an original patent may request, at any time 
during the pendency of applicant's pending complete application, that 
the specification and drawings be published as a statutory invention 
registration. Any such request must be signed by (1) the applicant and 
any assignee of record or (2) an attorney or agent of record in the 
application.
    (b) Any request for publication of a statutory invention 
registration must include the following parts:
    (1) A waiver of the applicant's right to receive a patent on the 
invention claimed effective upon the date of publication of the 
statutory invention registration;
    (2) The required fee for filing a request for publication of a 
statutory invention registration as provided for in Sec. 1.17 (n) or 
(o);
    (3) A statement that, in the opinion of the requester, the 
application to which the request is directed meets the requirements of 
35 U.S.C. 112; and
    (4) A statement that, in the opinion of the requester, the 
application to which the request is directed complies with the formal 
requirements of this part for printing as a patent.
    (c) A waiver filed with a request for a statutory invention 
registration will be effective, upon publication of the statutory 
invention registration, to waive the inventor's right to receive a 
patent on the invention claimed in the statutory invention registration, 
in any application for an original patent which is pending on, or filed 
after, the date of publication of the statutory invention registration. 
A waiver filed with a request for a statutory invention registration 
will not affect the rights of any other inventor even if the subject 
matter of the statutory invention registration and an application of 
another inventor are commonly owned. A waiver filed with a request for a 
statutory invention registration will not affect any rights in a patent 
to the inventor which issued prior to the date of publication of the 
statutory invention registration unless a reissue application is filed 
seeking to enlarge the scope of the claims of the patent. See also 
Sec. 1.104(c)(5).

Sec. 1.294  Examination of request for publication of a statutory invention registration and patent application to which the request is directed.

    (a) Any request for a statutory invention registration will be 
examined to determine if the requirements of Sec. 1.293 have been met. 
The application to which the request is directed will be examined to 
determine (1) if the subject matter of the application is appropriate 
for publication, (2) if the requirements for publication are met, and 
(3) if the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112 and Sec. 1.293 of this part are 
met.
    (b) Applicant will be notified of the results of the examination set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section. If the requirements of 
Sec. 1.293 and this section are not met by the request filed, the 
notification to applicant will set a period of time within which to 
comply with the requirements in order to avoid abandonment of the 
application. If the application does not meet the requirements of 35 
U.S.C. 112, the notification to applicant will include a rejection under 
the appropriate provisions of 35 U.S.C. 112. The periods for reply 
established pursuant to this section are subject to the extension of 
time provisions of Sec. 1.136. After reply by the applicant, the

Sec. 1.295  Review of decision finally refusing to publish a statutory invention registration.

    (a) Any requester who is dissatisfied with the final refusal to

compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112 may obtain review of the refusal to 
publish the statutory invention registration by filing a petition to the 
Commissioner accompanied by the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(h) within one 
month or such other time as is set in the decision refusing publication. 
Any such petition should comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.181(b). 
The petition may include a request that the petition fee be refunded if 
the final refusal to publish a statutory invention registration for 
reasons other than compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112 is determined to result 
from an error by the Patent and Trademark Office.
    (b) Any requester who is dissatisfied with a decision finally 
rejecting claims pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 112 may obtain review of the 
decision by filing an appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences pursuant to Sec. 1.191. If the decision rejecting claims 
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 112 is reversed, the request for a statutory 
invention registration will be approved and the registration published

registration. The statement will read as follows:

    A statutory invention registration is not a patent. It has the 
defensive attributes of a patent but does not have the enforceable 
attributes of a patent. No article or advertisement or the like may use 
the term patent, or any term suggestive of a patent, when referring to a 
statutory invention registration. For more specific information on the 
rights associated with a statutory invention registration see 35 U.S.C.

reexamination proceeding filed under Sec. 1.510 for a patent that issues 
from an original application filed in the United States before November 
29, 1999, dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals 
and Interferences, and any party to an interference dissatisfied with 
the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences may, 
instead of appealing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit (Sec. 1.301), have remedy by civil action under 35 U.S.C. 145 or 
146, as appropriate. Such civil action must be commenced within the time 
specified in Sec. 1.304.
    (b) If an applicant in an ex parte case or an owner of a patent 
involved in an ex parte reexamination proceeding filed under Sec. 1.510 
for a patent that issues from an original application filed in the 
United States before November 29, 1999, has taken an appeal to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, he or she thereby waives his

    (c) If any adverse party to an appeal taken to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit by a defeated party in an interference 
proceeding files notice with the Commissioner within twenty days after 
the filing of the defeated party's notice of appeal to the court 
(Sec. 1.302), that he or she elects to have all further proceedings

reconsideration of the decision is filed within the time period provided 
under Sec. 1.197(b), Sec. 1.658(b), or Sec. 1.979(a), the time for 
filing an appeal or commencing a civil action shall expire two months

    (ii) Two months after the date of decision of the Board of Patent 
Appeals and Interferences, whichever is later.
    (2) The time periods set forth in this section are not subject to 
the provisions of Sec. 1.136, Sec. 1.550(c), Sec. 1.956, or

    (3) The Commissioner may extend the time for filing an appeal or 
commencing a civil action:
    (i) For good cause shown if requested in writing before the 
expiration of the period for filing an appeal or commencing a civil 
action, or
    (ii) Upon written request after the expiration of the period for 
filing an appeal or commencing a civil action upon a showing that the 
failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.

[[Page 107]]

    (b) The times specified in this section in days are calendar days. 
The times specified herein in months are calendar months except that one 
day shall be added to any two-month period which includes February 28. 
If the last day of the time specified for appeal or commencing a civil 
action falls on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday in the District of 
Columbia, the time is extended to the next day which is neither a 
Saturday, Sunday nor a Federal holiday.
    (c) If a defeated party to an interference has taken an appeal to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and an adverse party 
has filed notice under 35 U.S.C. 141 electing to have all further 
proceedings conducted under 35 U.S.C. 146 (Sec. 1.303(c)), the time for 
filing a civil action thereafter is specified in 35 U.S.C. 141. The time

    (a) If, on examination, it appears that the applicant is entitled to 
a patent under the law, a notice of allowance will be sent to the 
applicant at the correspondence address indicated in Sec. 1.33. The 
notice of allowance shall specify a sum constituting the issue fee which 
must be paid within three months from the date of mailing of the notice 
of allowance to avoid abandonment of the application. The sum specified 
in the notice of allowance may also include the publication fee, in 
which case the issue fee and publication fee (Sec. 1.211(e)) must both 
be paid within three months from the date of mailing of the notice of 
allowance to avoid abandonment of the application. This three-month 
period is not extendable.
    (b) An authorization to charge the issue or other post-allowance 
fees set forth in Sec. 1.18 to a deposit account may be filed in an 
individual application only after mailing of the notice of allowance. 
The submission of either of the following after the mailing of a notice 
of allowance will operate as a request to charge the correct issue fee 
to any deposit account identified in a previously filed authorization to 
charge fees:
    (1) An incorrect issue fee; or
    (2) A completed Office-provided issue fee transmittal form (where no 
issue fee has been submitted).

Sec. 1.313  Withdrawal from issue.

    (a) Applications may be withdrawn from issue for further action at 
the initiative of the Office or upon petition by the applicant. To 
request that the Office withdraw an application from issue, applicant 
must file a petition under this section including the fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(h) and a showing of good and sufficient reasons why withdrawal 
of the application from issue is necessary. A petition under this 
section is not required if a request for continued examination under 
Sec. 1.114 is filed prior to payment of the issue fee. If the Office 
withdraws the application from issue, the Office will issue a new notice 
of allowance if the Office again allows the application.
    (b) Once the issue fee has been paid, the Office will not withdraw 
the application from issue at its own initiative for any reason except:
    (1) A mistake on the part of the Office;
    (2) A violation of Sec. 1.56 or illegality in the application;
    (3) Unpatentability of one or more claims; or
    (4) For interference.
    (c) Once the issue fee has been paid, the application will not be 
withdrawn

[[Page 108]]

from issue upon petition by the applicant for any reason except:
    (1) Unpatentability of one of more claims, which petition must be 
accompanied by an unequivocal statement that one or more claims are 
unpatentable, an amendment to such claim or claims, and an explanation 
as to how the amendment causes such claim or claims to be patentable;
    (2) Consideration of a request for continued examination in 
compliance with Sec. 1.114; or
    (3) Express abandonment of the application. Such express abandonment 
may be in favor of a continuing application.
    (d) A petition under this section will not be effective to withdraw 
the application from issue unless it is actually received and granted by 
the appropriate officials before the date of issue. Withdrawal of an 
application from issue after payment of the issue fee may not be 
effective to avoid publication of application information.

or any patent subject to the reexamination proceeding shall be 
enforceable only for and during such period that said patent is commonly 
owned with the application or patent which formed the basis for the 
rejection.

                            Maintenance Fees


<R05>
Sec. 1.362  Time for payment of maintenance fees.

    (a) Maintenance fees as set forth in Secs. 1.20 (e) through (g) are 
required to be paid in all patents based on applications filed on or 
after December 12, 1980, except as noted in paragraph (b) of this 
section, to maintain a patent in force beyond 4, 8 and 12 years after 
the date of grant.
    (b) Maintenance fees are not required for any plant patents or for 
any design patents. Maintenance fees are not required for a reissue 
patent if the patent being reissued did not require maintenance fees.
    (c) The application filing dates for purposes of payment of 
maintenance fees are as follows:
    (1) For an application not claiming benefit of an earlier 
application, the actual United States filing date of the application.
    (2) For an application claiming benefit of an earlier foreign 
application under 35 U.S.C. 119, the United States filing date of the 
application.
    (3) For a continuing (continuation, division, continuation-in-part) 
application claiming the benefit of a prior patent application under 35 
U.S.C. 120, the actual United States filing date of the continuing 
application.
    (4) For a reissue application, including a continuing reissue 
application claiming the benefit of a reissue application under 35 
U.S.C. 120, United States filing date of the original non-reissue 
application on which the patent reissued is based.
    (5) For an international application which has entered the United 
States as a Designated Office under 35 U.S.C. 371, the international 
filing date granted under Article 11(1) of the Patent Cooperation Treaty 
which is considered to be the United States filing date under 35 U.S.C. 
363.
    (d) Maintenance fees may be paid in patents without surcharge during 
the periods extending respectively from:
    (1) 3 years through 3 years and 6 months after grant for the first 
maintenance fee,
    (2) 7 years through 7 years and 6 months after grant for the second 
maintenance fee, and
    (3) 11 years through 11 years and 6 months after grant for the third 
maintenance fee.
    (e) Maintenance fees may be paid with the surcharge set forth in 
Sec. 1.20(h) during the respective grace periods after:
    (1) 3 years and 6 months and through the day of the 4th anniversary 
of the grant for the first maintenance fee.
    (2) 7 years and 6 months and through the day of the 8th anniversary 
of the grant for the second maintenance fee, and
    (3) 11 years and 6 months and through the day of the 12th 
anniversary of the grant for the third maintenance fee.
    (f) If the last day for paying a maintenance fee without surcharge 
set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, or the last day for paying a 
maintenance fee with surcharge set forth in paragraph (e) of this 
section, falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday within the 
District of Columbia, the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge 
may be paid under paragraph (d) or paragraph (e) respectively on the 
next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday.
    (g) Unless the maintenance fee and any applicable surcharge is paid 
within the time periods set forth in paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this 
section, the patent will expire as of the end of the grace period set 
forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A patent which expires for the 
failure to pay the maintenance fee will expire at the end of the same 
date (anniversary date) the patent was granted in the 4th, 8th, or 12th 
year after grant.

[[Page 112]]

    (h) The periods specified in Secs. 1.362 (d) and (e) with respect to 
a reissue application, including a continuing reissue application 
thereof, are counted from the date of grant of the original non-reissue 
application on which the reissued patent is based.

the correspondence address used during prosecution of the application as 
indicated in Sec. 1.33(a) unless:
    (1) A fee address for purposes of payment of maintenance fees is set 
forth when submitting the issue fee, or

after payment of the issue fee, or
    (3) A fee address or a change in the ``fee address'' is filed for 
purposes of receiving notices, receipts and other correspondence 
relating to the payment of maintenance fees after the payment of the 
issue fee, in which instance, the latest such address will be used.
    (b) An assignment of a patent application or patent does not result 
in a change of the ``correspondence address'' or ``fee address'' for 
maintenance fee purposes.

[49 FR 34725, Aug. 31, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 1.366  Submission of maintenance fees.

    (a) The patentee may pay maintenance fees and any necessary 
surcharges, or any person or organization may pay maintenance fees and 
any necessary surcharges on behalf of a patentee. Authorization by the 
patentee need not be filed in the Patent and Trademark Office to pay 
maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on behalf of the patentee.
    (b) A maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge submitted for a 
patent must be submitted in the amount due on the date the maintenance 
fee and any necessary surcharge are paid. A maintenance fee or surcharge 
may be paid in the manner set forth in Sec. 1.23 or by an authorization 
to charge a deposit account established pursuant to Sec. 1.25. Payment 
of a maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge or the authorization to 
charge a deposit account must be submitted within the periods set forth 
in Sec. 1.362 (d), (e), or (f). Any payment or authorization of 
maintenance fees and surcharges filed at any other time will not be 
accepted and will not serve as a payment of the maintenance fee except 
insofar as a delayed payment of the maintenance fee is accepted by the 
Commissioner in an expired patent pursuant to a petition filed under 
Sec. 1.378. Any authorization to charge a deposit account must authorize 
the immediate charging of the maintenance fee and any necessary 
surcharge to the deposit account. Payment of less than the required 
amount, payment in a manner other than that set forth Sec. 1.23, or in 
the filing of an authorization to charge a deposit account having 
insufficient funds will not constitute payment of a maintenance fee or 
surcharge on a patent. The procedures set forth in Sec. 1.8 or Sec. 1.10 
may be utilized in paying maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges.
    (c) In submitting maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges, 
identification of the patents for which maintenance fees are being paid 
must include the patent number, and the application number of the United 
States application for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being 
paid. If the payment includes identification of only the patent number 
(i.e., does not identify the application number of the United States 
application for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being paid), 
the Office may apply the payment to the patent identified by patent 
number in the payment or may return the payment.
    (d) Payment of maintenance fees and any surcharges should identify 
the fee being paid for each patent as to whether it is the 3\1/2\-, 7\1/
2\-, or 11\1/2\-year fee, whether small entity status is being changed 
or claimed, the amount of the maintenance fee and any surcharge being 
paid, and any assigned customer number. If the maintenance fee and any 
necessary surcharge is being paid on a reissue patent, the payment must 
identify the reissue patent by reissue

[[Page 113]]

patent number and reissue application number as required by paragraph 
(c) of this section and should also include the original patent number.
    (e) Maintenance fee payments and surcharge payments relating thereto 
must be submitted separate from any other payments for fees or charges, 
whether submitted in the manner set forth in Sec. 1.23 or by an 
authorization to charge a deposit account. If maintenance fee and 
surcharge payments for more than one patent are submitted together, they 
should be submitted on as few sheets as possible with the patent numbers 
listed in increasing patent number order. If the payment submitted is 
insufficient to cover the maintenance fees and surcharges for all the 
listed patents, the payment will be applied in the order the patents are 
listed, beginning at the top of the listing.
    (f) Notification of any change in status resulting in loss of 
entitlement to small entity status must be filed in a patent prior to 
paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest maintenance fee due after 
the date on which status as a small entity is no longer appropriate. See 
Sec. 1.27(g).
    (g) Maintenance fees and surcharges relating thereto will not be 
refunded except in accordance with Secs. 1.26 and 1.28(a).

Sec. 1.377  Review of decision refusing to accept and record payment of a maintenance fee filed prior to expiration of patent.

    (a) Any patentee who is dissatisfied with the refusal of the Patent 
and Trademark Office to accept and record a maintenance fee which was 
filed prior to the expiration of the patent may petition the 
Commissioner to accept and record the maintenance fee.
    (b) Any petition under this section must be filed within 2 months of 
the action complained of, or within such other time as may be set in the 
action complained of, and must be accompanied by the fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(h). The petition may include a request that the petition fee 
be refunded if the refusal to accept and record the maintenance fee is 
determined to result from an error by the Patent and Trademark Office.
    (c) Any petition filed under this section must comply with the 
requirements of Sec. 1.181(b) and must be signed by an attorney or agent 
registered to practice before the Patent and Trademark Office, or by the 
patentee, the assignee, or other party in interest.

Sec. 1.378  Acceptance of delayed payment of maintenance fee in expired patent to reinstate patent.

    (a) The Commissioner may accept the payment of any maintenance fee 
due on a patent after expiration of the patent if, upon petition, the 
delay in payment of the maintenance fee is shown to the satisfaction of 
the Commissioner to have been unavoidable (paragraph (b) of this 
section) or unintentional (paragraph (c) of this section) and if the 
surcharge required by Sec. 1.20(i) is paid as a condition of accepting 
payment of the maintenance fee. If the Commissioner accepts payment of 
the maintenance fee upon petition, the patent shall be considered as not 
having expired, but will be subject to the conditions set forth in 35 
U.S.C. 41(c)(2).
    (b) Any petition to accept an unavoidably delayed payment of a 
maintenance fee filed under paragraph (a) of this section must include:
    (1) The required maintenance fee set forth in Sec. 1.20 (e) through 
(g);
    (2) The surcharge set forth in Sec. 1.20(i)(1); and
    (3) A showing that the delay was unavoidable since reasonable care 
was taken to ensure that the maintenance fee would be paid timely and 
that the petition was filed promptly after the patentee was notified of, 
or otherwise became aware of, the expiration of the patent. The showing 
must enumerate the steps taken to ensure timely payment of the 
maintenance fee, the date and the manner in which patentee became aware 
of the expiration of the patent, and the steps taken to file the 
petition promptly.
    (c) Any petition to accept an unintentionally delayed payment of a 
maintenance fee filed under paragraph

[[Page 114]]

(a) of this section must be filed within twenty-four months after the 
six-month grace period provided in Sec. 1.362(e) and must include:
    (1) The required maintenance fee set forth in Sec. 1.20 (e) through 
(g);
    (2) The surcharge set forth in Sec. 1.20(i)(2); and
    (3) A statement that the delay in payment of the maintenance fee was 
unintentional.
    (d) Any petition under this section must be signed by an attorney or 
agent registered to practice before the Patent and Trademark Office, or 
by the patentee, the assignee, or other party in interest.
    (e) Reconsideration of a decision refusing to accept a maintenance 
fee upon petition filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section may be 
obtained by filing a petition for reconsideration within two months of, 
or such other time as set in, the decision refusing to accept the 
delayed payment of the maintenance fee. Any such petition for 
reconsideration must be accompanied by the petition fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(h). After decision on the petition for reconsideration, no 
further reconsideration or review of the matter will be undertaken by 
the Commissioner. If the delayed payment of the maintenance fee is not 
accepted, the maintenance fee and the surcharge set forth in 
Sec. 1.20(i) will be refunded following the decision on the petition for 
reconsideration, or after the expiration of the time for filing such a 
petition for reconsideration, if none is filed. Any petition fee under 
this section will not be refunded unless the refusal to accept and 
record the maintenance fee is determined to result from an error by the 
Patent and Trademark Office.

international application does not include an applicant who is indicated 
as being a resident or national of the United States of America, and at 
least one applicant:
    (1) Has indicated a residence or nationality in a PCT Contracting 
State, or

acting as a Receiving Office. (See also Sec. 1.412(c)(6).)
    (b) Although the United States Receiving Office will accept 
international applications filed by any resident or national of the 
United States of America for international processing, an international

the inventor or as provided in Sec. 1.422, 1.423 or Sec. 1.425.
    (c) International applications which do not designate the United 
States of America may be filed by the assignee or owner.
    (d) The attorney or agent of the applicant may sign the 
international application Request and file the international application 
for the applicant if the international application when filed is 
accompanied by a separate power of attorney to that attorney or agent 
from the applicant. The separate power of attorney from the applicant 
may be submitted after filing if sufficient cause is shown for not 
submitting it at the time of filing. Note that paragraph (b) of this 
section requires that the applicant be the inventor if the United States 
of America is designated.
    (e) Any indication of different applicants for the purpose of 
different Designated Offices must be shown on the Request portion of the 
international application.
    (f) Changes in the person, name, or address of the applicant of an

appearing in the request or demand:
    (i) Person name, residence, nationality or address of the applicant,
    (ii) Person, name or address of the agent, the common representative 
or the inventor.
    (b) The International Bureau shall not record the requested change 
if the request for recording is received by it after the expiration:

international application which designates the United States of America.


<R05>
Sec. 1.423  When the inventor is insane or legally incapacitated.

    In case an inventor is insane or otherwise legally incapacitated, 
the legal representative (guardian, conservator, etc.) of such inventor 
may file an international application which designates the United States 
of America.


<R05>
Sec. 1.424  Joint inventors.

    Joint inventors must jointly file an international application which 
designates the United States of America; the signature of either of them 
alone, or less than the entire number will be insufficient for an 
invention invented by them jointly, except as provided in Sec. 1.425.


<R05>
Sec. 1.425  Filing by other than inventor.

    Where an international application which designates the United 
States of America is filed and where one or more

[[Page 118]]

inventors refuse to sign the Request for the international application 
or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, the Request need 
not be signed by such inventor if it is signed by another applicant. 
Such international application must be accompanied by a statement 
explaining to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the lack of the 
signature concerned.

4.9 and section 115 of the Administrative Instructions. Applicant must 
specify at least one national or regional designation on filing of the 
international application for a filing date to be granted.
    (b) If the fees necessary to cover all the national and regional 
designations specified in the Request are not paid by the applicant 
within one year from the priority date or within one month from the date 
of receipt of the international application if that month expires after 
the expiration of one year from the priority date, applicant will be 
notified

[[Page 119]]

and given one month within which to pay the deficient designation fees 
plus a late payment fee. The late payment fee shall be equal to the 
greater of fifty percent of the amount of the deficient fees up to a 
maximum amount equal to the basic fee, or an amount equal to the 
transmittal fee (PCT Rule 16bis). The one-month time limit set in the 
notification of deficient designation fees may not be extended. Failure 
to timely pay at least one designation fee will result in the withdrawal 
of the international application.
    (1) The one designation fee must be paid:
    (i) Within one year from the priority date;
    (ii) Within one month from the date of receipt of the international 
application if that month expires after the expiration of one year from

time set in the notification of the deficient designation fees or in 
accordance with PCT Rule 16bis.1(e).
    (2) If after a notification of deficient designation fees the 
applicant makes timely payment, but the amount paid is not sufficient to 
cover the late payment fee and all designation fees, the Receiving 
Office will, after allocating payment for the basic, search, transmittal 
and late payment fees, allocate the amount paid in accordance with PCT 
Rule 16bis.1(c) and withdraw the unpaid designations. The notification 
of deficient designation fees pursuant to this paragraph may be made 
simultaneously with any notification pursuant to Sec. 1.431(c).
    (c) The amount payable for the designation fee set forth in 
paragraph (b) is:
    (1) The designation fee in effect on the filing date of the 
international application, if such fee is paid in full within one month 
from the date of receipt of the international application;
    (2) The designation fee in effect on the date such fee is paid in 
full, if such fee is paid in full later than one month from the date of 
receipt of the international application but within one year from the 
priority date;
    (3) The designation fee in effect on the date one year from the 
priority date, if the fee was due one year from the priority date, and 
such fee is paid in full later than one month from the date of receipt 
of the international application and later than one year from the 
priority date; or
    (4) The designation fee in effect on the international filing date, 
if the fee was due one month from the international filing date and 
after one year from the priority date, and such fee is paid in full 
later than one month from the date of receipt of the international 
application and later than one year from the priority date.
    (d) On filing the international application, in addition to 
specifying at least one national or regional designation under PCT Rule 
4.9(a), applicant may also indicate under PCT Rule 4.9(b) that all other 
designations permitted under the Treaty are made.
    (1) Indication of other designations permitted by the Treaty under 
PCT Rule 4.9(b) must be made in a statement on the Request that any 
designation made under this paragraph is subject to confirmation (PCT 
Rule 4.9(c)) not later than the expiration of 15 months from the 
priority date by:
    (i) Filing a written notice with the United States Receiving Office 
specifying the national and/or regional designations being confirmed;
    (ii) Paying the designation fee for each designation being 
confirmed; and
    (iii) Paying the confirmation fee specified in Sec. 1.445(a)(4).
    (2) Unconfirmed designations will be considered withdrawn. If the 
amount submitted is not sufficient to cover the designation fee and the 
confirmation fee for each designation being confirmed, the Receiving 
Office will allocate the amount paid in accordance with any priority of 
designations specified by applicant. If applicant does not specify any 
priority of designations, the allocation of the amount paid will be made 
in accordance with PCT Rule 16bis.1(c).

<R05>
Sec. 1.446  Refund of international application filing and processing fees.

    (a) Money paid for international application fees, where paid by 
actual mistake or in excess, such as a payment not required by law or 
treaty and its regulations, may be refunded. A mere change of purpose 
after the payment of a fee will not entitle a party to a refund of such 
fee. The Office will not refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less 
unless a refund is specifically requested and will not notify the payor 
of such amounts. If the payor or party requesting a refund does not 
provide the banking information necessary for making refunds by 
electronic funds transfer, the Office may use the banking information 
provided on the payment instrument to make any refund by electronic 
funds transfer.
    (b) Any request for refund under paragraph (a) of this section must 
be filed within two years from the date the fee was paid. If the Office 
charges a deposit account by an amount other than an amount specifically 
indicated in an authorization under Sec. 1.25(b), any request for refund 
based upon such charge must be filed within two years from the date of 
the deposit account statement indicating such charge and include a copy 
of that deposit account statement. The time periods set forth in this 
paragraph are not extendable.
    (c) Refund of the supplemental search fees will be made if such 
refund is determined to be warranted by the Commissioner or the 
Commissioner's designee acting under PCT Rule 40.2(c).
    (d) The international and search fees will be refunded if no 
international filing date is accorded or if the application is withdrawn 
before transmittal of the record copy to the International Bureau (PCT 
Rules 15.6 and 16.2). The search fee will be refunded if the application 
is withdrawn before transmittal of the search copy to the International 
Searching Authority. The transmittal fee will not be refunded.
    (e) The handling fee (Sec. 1.482(b)) will be refunded (PCT Rule 
57.6) only if:
    (1) The Demand is withdrawn before the Demand has been sent by the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority to the International 
Bureau, or
    (2) The Demand is considered not to have been submitted (PCT Rule 
54.4(a)).

section, be made on the Request (PCT Rule 4.10) in a manner complying 
with sections 110

[[Page 122]]

and 115 of the Administrative Instructions.
    (b) Whenever the priority of an earlier United States national 
application or international application filed with the United States 
Receiving Office is claimed in an international application, the 
applicant may request in the Request or in a letter of transmittal 
accompanying the international application upon filing with the United 
States Receiving Office or in a separate letter filed in the United 
States Receiving Office not later than 16 months after the priority 
date, that the United States Patent and Trademark Office prepare a 
certified copy of the prior application for transmittal to the 
International Bureau (PCT Article 8 and PCT Rule 17). The fee for 
preparing a certified copy is set forth in Sec. 1.19(b)(1).
    (c) If a certified copy of the priority document is not submitted 
together with the international application on filing, or, if the 
priority application was filed in the United States and a request and 
appropriate payment for preparation of such a certified copy do not 
accompany the international application on filing or are not filed 
within 16 months of the priority date, the certified copy of the 
priority document must be furnished by the applicant to the 
International Bureau or to the United States Receiving Office within the 
time limit specified in PCT Rule 17.1(a).

<R05>
Sec. 1.455  Representation in international applications.

    (a) Applicants of international applications may be represented by 
attorneys or agents registered to practice before the Patent and 
Trademark Office or by an applicant appointed as a common representative 
(PCT Art. 49, Rules 4.8 and 90 and Sec. 10.10). If applicants have not 
appointed an attorney or agent or one of the applicants to represent 
them, and there is more than one applicant, the applicant first named in 
the request and who is entitled to file in the U.S. Receiving Office 
shall be considered to be the common representative of all the 
applicants. An attorney or agent having the right to practice before a 
national office with which an international application is filed and for 
which the United States is an International Searching Authority or 
International Preliminary Examining Authority may be appointed to 
represent the applicants in the international application before that 
authority. An attorney or agent may appoint an associate attorney or 
agent who shall also then be of record (PCT Rule 90.1(d)). The 
appointment of an attorney or agent, or of a common representative, 
revokes any earlier appointment unless otherwise indicated (PCT Rule 
90.6 (b) and (c)).
    (b) Appointment of an agent, attorney or common representative (PCT 
Rule 4.8) must be effected either in the Request form, signed by all 
applicants, or in a separate power of attorney submitted either to the 
United States Receiving Office or to the International Bureau.
    (c) Powers of attorney and revocations thereof should be submitted 
to the United States Receiving Office until the issuance of the 
international search report.
    (d) The addressee for correspondence will be as indicated in section 
108 of the Administrative Instructions.

    (a) For the purpose of computing time limits under the Treaty, the 
priority date shall be defined as in PCT Art. 2(xi).
    (b) When a claimed priority date is corrected or added under PCT 
Rule 26bis.1(a), or withdrawn under PCT Rule 90bis.3, or considered not 
to have been made under PCT Rule 26bis.2, the priority date for the 
purposes of computing any non-expired time limits will be the date of 
the earliest valid remaining priority claim of the international 
application, or if none, the international filing date.
    (c) When corrections under PCT Art. 11(2), Art. 14(2) or PCT Rule 
20.2(a) (i) or (iii) are timely submitted, and the date of receipt of 
such corrections falls later than one year from the claimed priority 
date or dates, the Receiving Office shall proceed under PCT Rule

                           Unity of Invention


<R05>
Sec. 1.475  Unity of invention before the International Searching Authority, the International Preliminary Examining Authority and during the national stage.

    (a) An international and a national stage application shall relate 
to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a 
single general inventive concept (``requirement of unity of 
invention''). Where a group

[[Page 124]]

of inventions is claimed in an application, the requirement of unity of 
invention shall be fulfilled only when there is a technical relationship 
among those inventions involving one or more of the same or 
corresponding special technical features. The expression ``special 
technical features'' shall mean those technical features that define a 
contribution which each of the claimed inventions, considered as a 
whole, makes over the prior art.
    (b) An international or a national stage application containing 
claims to different categories of invention will be considered to have 
unity of invention if the claims are drawn only to one of the following 
combinations of categories:
    (1) A product and a process specially adapted for the manufacture of 
said product; or
    (2) A product and a process of use of said product; or
    (3) A product, a process specially adapted for the manufacture of 
the said product, and a use of the said product; or
    (4) A process and an apparatus or means specifically designed for 
carrying out the said process; or
    (5) A product, a process specially adapted for the manufacture of 
the said product, and an apparatus or means specifically designed for 
carrying out the said process.
    (c) If an application contains claims to more or less than one of 
the combinations of categories of invention set forth in paragraph (b) 
of this section, unity of invention might not be present.
    (d) If multiple products, processes of manufacture or uses are 
claimed, the first invention of the category first mentioned in the 
claims of the application and the first recited invention of each of the 
other categories related thereto will be considered as the main 
invention in the claims, see PCT Article 17(3)(a) and Sec. 1.476(c).
    (e) The determination whether a group of inventions is so linked as 
to form a single general inventive concept shall be made without regard 
to whether the inventions are claimed in separate claims or as 
alternatives within a single claim.

[58 FR 4345, Jan. 14, 1993]


<R05>
Sec. 1.476  Determination of unity of invention before the International Searching Authority.

    (a) Before establishing the international search report, the 
International Searching Authority will determine whether the 
international application complies with the requirement of unity of 
invention as set forth in Sec. 1.475.
    (b) If the International Searching Authority considers that the 
international application does not comply with the requirement of unity 
of invention, it shall inform the applicant accordingly and invite the 
payment of additional fees (note Sec. 1.445 and PCT Art. 17(3)(a) and 
PCT Rule 40). The applicant will be given a time period in accordance 
with PCT Rule 40.3 to pay the additional fees due.
    (c) In the case of non-compliance with unity of invention and where 
no additional fees are paid, the international search will be performed 
on the invention first mentioned (``main invention'') in the claims.
    (d) Lack of unity of invention may be directly evident before 
considering the claims in relation to any prior art, or after taking the 
prior art into consideration, as where a document discovered during the 
search shows the invention claimed in a generic or linking claim lacks 
novelty or is clearly obvious, leaving two or more claims joined thereby 
without a common inventive concept. In such a case the International 
Searching Authority may raise the objection of lack of unity of 
invention.

<R05>
Sec. 1.477  Protest to lack of unity of invention before the International Searching Authority.

    (a) If the applicant disagrees with the holding of lack of unity of 
invention by the International Searching Authority, additional fees may 
be paid under protest, accompanied by a request for refund and a 
statement setting forth reasons for disagreement or why the required 
additional fees are considered excessive, or both (PCT Rule 40.2(c)).
    (b) Protest under paragraph (a) of this section will be examined by 
the

[[Page 125]]

Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee. In the event that the 
applicant's protest is determined to be justified, the additional fees 
or a portion thereof will be refunded.
    (c) An applicant who desires that a copy of the protest and the 
decision thereon accompany the international search report when 
forwarded to the Designated Offices, may notify the International 
Searching Authority to that effect any time prior to the issuance of the 
international search report. Thereafter, such notification should be 
directed to the International Bureau (PCT Rule 40.2(c)).

<R05>
Sec. 1.484  Conduct of international preliminary examination.

    (a) An international preliminary examination will be conducted to 
formulate a non-binding opinion as to whether the claimed invention has 
novelty, involves an inventive step (is non-obvious) and is industrially 
applicable.
    (b) International preliminary examination will begin promptly upon 
receipt of a proper Demand in an application for which the United States 
International Preliminary Examining Authority is competent, for which 
the fees for international preliminary examination (Sec. 1.482) have 
been paid, and which requests examination based on the application as 
filed or as amended by an amendment which has been received by the 
United States International Preliminary Examining Authority. Where a 
Demand requests examination based on a PCT Article 19 amendment which 
has not been received, examination may begin at 20 months without 
receipt of the PCT Article 19 amendment. Where a Demand requests 
examination based on a PCT Article 34 amendment which has not been 
received, applicant will be notified and given a time period within 
which to submit the amendment.
    (1) Examination will begin after the earliest of:
    (i) Receipt of the amendment;
    (ii) Receipt of applicant's statement that no amendment will be 
made; or
    (iii) Expiration of the time period set in the notification.
    (2) No international preliminary examination report will be 
established prior to issuance of an international search report.
    (c) No international preliminary examination will be conducted on 
inventions not previously searched by an International Searching 
Authority.
    (d) The International Preliminary Examining Authority will establish 
a written opinion if any defect exists or if the claimed invention lacks 
novelty, inventive step or industrial applicability and will set a non-
extendable time limit in the written opinion for the applicant to reply.
    (e) If no written opinion under paragraph (d) of this section is 
necessary, or after any written opinion and the reply thereto or the 
expiration of the time limit for reply to such written opinion, an 
international preliminary examination report will be established by the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority. One copy will be 
submitted to the International Bureau and one copy will be submitted to 
the applicant.
    (f) An applicant will be permitted a personal or telephone interview 
with the examiner, which must be conducted during the non-extendable 
time limit for reply by the applicant to a written opinion. Additional 
interviews may be conducted where the examiner determines that such 
additional interviews may be helpful to advancing the international 
preliminary examination procedure. A summary of any such personal or 
telephone interview must be filed by the applicant as a part of the 
reply to the written opinion or, if applicant files no reply, be made of 
record in the file by the examiner.
    (g) If the application whose priority is claimed in the 
international application is in a language other than English, the 
United States International Preliminary Examining Authority may, where 
the validity of the priority claim is relevant for the formulation of 
the opinion referred to in Article 33(1), invite the applicant to 
furnish an English translation of the priority document within two 
months from the date of the invitation. If the translation is not 
furnished within that time limit, the international preliminary 
examination report may be

Demand. The applicant may also make amendments within the time limit set 
by the International Preliminary Examining Authority for reply to any 
notification under Sec. 1.484(b) or to any written opinion. Any such 
amendments must:
    (1) Be made by submitting a replacement sheet in compliance with PCT 
Rules 10 and 11.1 to 11.13 for every sheet of the application which 
differs from the sheet it replaces unless an entire sheet is cancelled; 
and
    (2) Include a description of how the replacement sheet differs from 
the replaced sheet. Amendments that do not comply with PCT Rules 10 and 
11.1 to 11.13 may not be entered.

Sec. 1.488  Determination of unity of invention before the International Preliminary Examining Authority.

    (a) Before establishing any written opinion or the international 
preliminary examination report, the International Preliminary Examining 
Authority will determine whether the international application complies 
with the requirement of unity of invention as set forth in Sec. 1.475.
    (b) If the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers 
that the international application does not comply with the requirement 
of unity of invention, it may:
    (1) Issue a written opinion and/or an international preliminary 
examination report, in respect of the entire international application 
and indicate that unity of invention is lacking and specify the reasons 
therefor without extending an invitation to restrict or pay additional 
fees. No international preliminary examination will be conducted on 
inventions not previously searched by an International Searching 
Authority.
    (2) Invite the applicant to restrict the claims or pay additional 
fees, pointing out the categories of invention found, within a set time 
limit which will not be extended. No international preliminary 
examination will be conducted on inventions not previously searched by 
an International Searching Authority, or
    (3) If applicant fails to restrict the claims or pay additional fees 
within the time limit set for reply, the International Preliminary 
Examining Authority will issue a written opinion and/or establish an 
international preliminary examination report on the main invention and 
shall indicate the relevant facts in the said report. In case of any 
doubt as to which invention is the main invention, the invention first 
mentioned in the claims and previously searched by an International 
Searching Authority shall be considered the main invention.
    (c) Lack of unity of invention may be directly evident before 
considering the claims in relation to any prior art, or after taking the 
prior art into consideration, as where a document discovered during the 
search shows the invention claimed in a generic or linking claim lacks 
novelty or is clearly obvious, leaving two or more claims joined thereby 
without a common inventive concept. In such a case the International 
Preliminary Examining Authority may raise the objection of lack of unity 
of invention.

<R05>
Sec. 1.489  Protest to lack of unity of invention before the International Preliminary Examining Authority.

    (a) If the applicant disagrees with the holding of lack of unity of 
invention by the International Preliminary Examining Authority, 
additional fees may be paid under protest, accompanied by a request for 
refund and a statement setting forth reasons for disagreement or why the 
required additional fees are considered excessive, or both.

[[Page 128]]

    (b) Protest under paragraph (a) of this section will be examined by 
the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee. In the event that the 
applicant's protest is determined to be justified, the additional fees 
or a portion thereof will be refunded.
    (c) An applicant who desires that a copy of the protest and the 
decision thereon accompany the international preliminary examination 
report when forwarded to the Elected Offices, may notify the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority to that effect any time 
prior to the issuance of the international preliminary examination 
report. Thereafter, such notification should be directed to the

preliminary examination report (if applicable), if the annexes were made 
in another language, must be furnished not later than the expiration of 
thirty

[[Page 130]]

months from the priority date. Translations of the annexes which are not 
received by the expiration of thirty months from the priority date may 
be submitted within any period set pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section accompanied by the processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.492(f). 
Annexes for which translations are not timely received will be 
considered canceled.
    (f) Verification of the translation of the international application 
or any other document pertaining to an international application may be 
required where it is considered necessary, if the international 
application or other document was filed in a language other than 
English.
    (g) The documents and fees submitted under paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section must, except for a copy of the international publication or 
translation of the international application that is identified as 
provided in Sec. 1.417, be clearly identified as a submission to enter 
the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371. Otherwise, the submission will 
be considered as being made under 35 U.S.C. 111(a).
    (h) An international application becomes abandoned as to the United 
States thirty months from the priority date if the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section have not been complied with within thirty 
months from the priority date. If the requirements of paragraph (b) of 
this section are complied with within thirty months from the priority 
date but either of any required translation of the international 
application as filed or the oath or declaration are not timely filed, an 
international application will become abandoned as to the United States 
upon expiration of the time period set pursuant to paragraph (c) of this 
section.

Sec. 1.496  Examination of international applications in the national stage.

    (a) International applications which have complied with the 
requirements of 35 U.S.C. 371(c) will be taken up for action based on 
the date on which such requirements were met. However, unless an express 
request for early processing has been filed under 35 U.S.C. 371(f), no 
action may be taken prior to one month after entry into the national 
stage.
    (b) A national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. 371 may have 
paid therein the basic national fee as set forth in Sec. 1.492(a)(4) if 
it contains, or is amended to contain, at the time of entry into the 
national stage, only claims which have been indicated in an 
international preliminary examination report prepared by the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office as satisfying the criteria of PCT 
Article 33(1)-(4) as to novelty, inventive step and industrial 
applicability. Such national stage applications in which the basic 
national fee as set forth in Sec. 1.492(a)(4) has been paid may be 
amended subsequent to the date of entry into the national stage only to 
the extent necessary to eliminate objections as to form or to cancel 
rejected claims. Such national stage applications in which the basic 
national fee as set forth in Sec. 1.492(a)(4) has been paid will be 
taken up out of order.

<R05>
Sec. 1.497  Oath or declaration under 35 U.S.C. 371(c)(4).

    (a) When an applicant of an international application desires to 
enter the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371 pursuant to Sec. 1.495, and 
a declaration in compliance with this section has not been previously 
submitted in the international application under PCT Rule 4.17(iv) 
within the time limits provided for in PCT Rule 26ter.1, he or she must 
file an oath or declaration that:
    (1) Is executed in accordance with either Secs. 1.66 or 1.68;
    (2) Identifies the application to which it is directed;
    (3) Identifies each inventor and the country of citizenship of each 
inventor; and
    (4) States that the person making the oath or declaration believes 
the named inventor or inventors to be the original and first inventor or 
inventors of the subject matter which is claimed and for which a patent 
is sought.
    (b)(1) The oath or declaration must be made by all of the actual 
inventors

[[Page 131]]

except as provided for in Secs. 1.42, 1.43 or 1.47.
    (2) If the person making the oath or declaration or any supplemental 
oath or declaration is not the inventor (Secs. 1.42, 1.43, or 
Sec. 1.47), the oath or declaration shall state the relationship of the 
person to the inventor, and, upon information and belief, the facts 
which the inventor would have been required to state. If the person 
signing the oath or declaration is the legal representative of a 
deceased inventor, the oath or declaration shall also state that the 
person is a legal representative and the citizenship, residence and 
mailing address of the legal representative.
    (c) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, if the oath or 
declaration meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section, the oath or declaration will be accepted as complying with 35 
U.S.C. 371(c)(4) and Sec. 1.495(c). However, if the oath or declaration 
does not also meet the requirements of Sec. 1.63, a supplemental oath or 
declaration in compliance with Sec. 1.63 or an application data sheet 
will be required in accordance with Sec. 1.67.
    (d) If the oath or declaration filed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 371(c)(4) 
and this section names an inventive entity different from the inventive 
entity set forth in the international application, or if a change to the 
inventive entity has been effected under PCT Rule 92bis subsequent to 
the execution of any oath or declaration which was filed in the 
application under PCT Rule 4.17(iv) or this section and the inventive 
entity thus changed is different from the inventive entity identified in 
any such oath or declaration, applicant must submit:
    (1) A statement from each person being added as an inventor and from 
each person being deleted as an inventor that any error in inventorship 
in the international application occurred without deceptive intention on 
his or her part;
    (2) The processing fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(i);
    (3) If an assignment has been executed by any of the original named 
inventors, the written consent of the assignee (see Sec. 3.73(b) of this 
chapter); and
    (4) Any new oath or declaration required by paragraph (f) of this 
section.
    (e) The Office may require such other information as may be deemed 
appropriate under the particular circumstances surrounding the 
correction of inventorship.
    (f) A new oath or declaration in accordance with this section must 
be filed to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 371(c)(4) if the declaration was filed 
under PCT Rule 4.17(iv), and:
    (1) There was a change in the international filing date pursuant to 
PCT Rule 20.2 after the declaration was executed; or
    (2) A change in the inventive entity was effected under PCT Rule 
92bis after the declaration was executed and no declaration which sets 
forth and is executed by the inventive entity as so changed has been 
filed in the application.
    (g) If a priority claim has been corrected or added pursuant to PCT 
Rule 26bis during the international stage after the declaration of 
inventorship was executed in the international application under PCT 
Rule 4.17(iv), applicant will be required to submit either a new oath or 
declaration or an application data sheet as set forth in Sec. 1.76 
correctly identifying the application upon which priority is claimed.

Sec. 1.499  Unity of invention during the national stage.

    If the examiner finds that a national stage application lacks unity 
of invention under Sec. 1.475, the examiner may in an Office action 
require the applicant in the response to that action to elect the 
invention to which the claims shall be restricted. Such requirement may 
be made before any action on the merits but may be made at any time 
before the final action at the discretion of the examiner. Review of any 
such requirement is provided under Secs. 1.143 and 1.144.

Sec. 1.501  Citation of prior art in patent files.

    (a) At any time during the period of enforceability of a patent, any 
person may cite, to the Office in writing, prior art consisting of 
patents or printed publications which that person states to be pertinent 
and applicable to the patent and believes to have a bearing on the 
patentability of any claim of the patent. If the citation is made by the 
patent owner, the explanation of pertinency and applicability may 
include an explanation of how the claims differ from the prior art. Such 
citations shall be entered in the patent file except as set forth in 
Secs. 1.502 and 1.902.
    (b) If the person making the citation wishes his or her identity to 
be excluded from the patent file and kept confidential, the citation 
papers must be submitted without any identification of the person making 
the submission.
    (c) Citation of patents or printed publications by the public in 
patent files should either:

    (1) Reflect that a copy of the same has been mailed to the patent 
owner at the address as provided for in Sec. 1.33(c); or in the event 
service is not possible
    (2) Be filed with the Office in duplicate.

    Citations by the patent owner under Sec. 1.555 and by an ex parte 
reexamination requester under either Sec. 1.510 or Sec. 1.535 will be 
entered in the reexamination file during a reexamination proceeding. The 
entry in the patent file of citations submitted after the date of an 
order to reexamine pursuant to Sec. 1.525 by persons other than the 
patent owner, or an ex parte reexamination requester under either 
Sec. 1.510 or Sec. 1.535, will be delayed until the reexamination 
proceeding has been terminated. See Sec. 1.902 for processing of prior 
art citations in patent and reexamination files during an inter partes

                   Request for Ex Parte Reexamination


<R05>
Sec. 1.510  Request for ex parte reexamination.

    (a) Any person may, at any time during the period of enforceability 
of a patent, file a request for an ex parte reexamination by the Office 
of any claim of the patent on the basis of prior art patents or printed 
publications cited under Sec. 1.501. The request must be accompanied by 
the fee for requesting reexamination set in Sec. 1.20(c)(1).
    (b) Any request for reexamination must include the following parts:
    (1) A statement pointing out each substantial new question of 
patentability based on prior patents and printed publications.
    (2) An identification of every claim for which reexamination is 
requested, and a detailed explanation of the pertinency and manner of 
applying the cited prior art to every claim for which reexamination is 
requested. If appropriate the party requesting reexamination may also 
point out how claims distinguish over cited prior art.
    (3) A copy of every patent or printed publication relied upon or 
referred to in paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section accompanied by 
an English language translation of all the necessary and pertinent parts 
of any non-English language patent or printed publication.
    (4) A copy of the entire patent including the front face, drawings, 
and specification/claims (in double column format) for which 
reexamination is requested, and a copy of any disclaimer, certificate of 
correction, or reexamination certificate issued in the patent. All 
copies must have each page plainly written on only one side of a sheet 
of paper.
    (5) A certification that a copy of the request filed by a person 
other than the patent owner has been served in its entirety on the 
patent owner at the address as provided for in Sec. 1.33(c). The name 
and address of the party served

[[Page 133]]

must be indicated. If service was not possible, a duplicate copy must be 
supplied to the Office.
    (c) If the request does not include the fee for requesting 
reexamination or all of the parts required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, the person identified as requesting reexamination will be so 
notified and given an opportunity to complete the request within a 
specified time. If the fee for requesting reexamination has been paid 
but the defect in the request is not corrected within the specified 
time, the determination whether or not to institute reexamination will 
be made on the request as it then exists. If the fee for requesting 
reexamination has not been paid, no determination will be made and the 
request will be placed in the patent file as a citation if it complies 
with the requirements of Sec. 1.501(a).
    (d) The filing date of the request is:
    (1) The date on which the request including the entire fee for 
requesting reexamination is received in the Patent and Trademark Office; 
or
    (2) The date on which the last portion of the fee for requesting 
reexamination is received.
    (e) A request filed by the patent owner may include a proposed 
amendment in accordance with Sec. 1.530.
    (f) If a request is filed by an attorney or agent identifying 
another party on whose behalf the request is being filed, the attorney 
or agent must have a power of attorney from that party or be acting in a 
representative capacity pursuant to Sec. 1.34(a).

Sec. 1.515  Determination of the request for ex parte reexamination.

    (a) Within three months following the filing date of a request for 
an ex parte reexamination, an examiner will consider the request and 
determine whether or not a substantial new question of patentability 
affecting any claim of the patent is raised by the request and the prior 
art cited therein, with or without consideration of other patents or 
printed publications. The examiner's determination will be based on the 
claims in effect at the time of the determination, will become a part of 
the official file of the patent, and will be mailed to the patent owner 
at the address as provided for in Sec. 1.33(c) and to the person 
requesting reexamination.
    (b) Where no substantial new question of patentability has been 
found, a refund of a portion of the fee for requesting ex parte 
reexamination will be made to the requester in accordance with 
Sec. 1.26(c).
    (c) The requester may seek review by a petition to the Commissioner 
under Sec. 1.181 within one month of the mailing date of the examiner's 
determination refusing ex parte reexamination. Any such petition must 
comply with Sec. 1.181(b). If no petition is timely filed or if the 
decision on petition affirms that no substantial new question of 
patentability has been raised, the determination shall be final and 
nonappealable.

Sec. 1.520  Ex parte reexamination at the initiative of the Commissioner.

    The Commissioner, at any time during the period of enforceability of 
a patent, may determine whether or not a substantial new question of 
patentability is raised by patents or printed publications which have 
been discovered by the Commissioner or which have been brought to the 
Commissioner's attention, even though no request for reexamination has 
been filed in accordance with Sec. 1.510 or Sec. 1.913. The Commissioner 
may initiate ex parte reexamination without a request for reexamination 
pursuant to Sec. 1.510 or Sec. 1.913. Normally requests from outside the 
Office that the Commissioner undertake reexamination on his own 
initiative will not be considered. Any determination to initiate ex 
parte reexamination under this section will become a part of the 
official file of the patent and will be mailed to the patent owner at 
the address as provided for in Sec. 1.33(c).

Sec. 1.525  Order for ex parte reexamination.

    (a) If a substantial new question of patentability is found pursuant 
to Sec. 1.515 or Sec. 1.520, the determination will include an order for 
ex parte reexamination of the patent for resolution of the question. If 
the order for ex parte reexamination resulted from a petition pursuant 
to Sec. 1.515(c), the ex parte reexamination will ordinarily be 
conducted by an examiner other than the examiner responsible for the 
initial determination under Sec. 1.515(a).
    (b) The notice published in the Official Gazette under Sec. 1.11(c) 
will be considered to be constructive notice and ex parte reexamination 
will proceed.

<R05>
Sec. 1.530  Statement by patent owner in ex parte reexamination; amendment by patent owner in ex parte or inter partes reexamination; inventorship change in ex 
          parte or inter partes reexamination.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 1.510(e), no statement or other 
response by the patent owner in an ex parte reexamination proceeding 
shall be filed prior to the determinations made in accordance with 
Sec. 1.515 or Sec. 1.520. If a premature statement or other response is 
filed by the patent owner, it will not be acknowledged or considered in 
making the determination.
    (b) The order for ex parte reexamination will set a period of not 
less than two months from the date of the order within which the patent 
owner may file a statement on the new question of patentability, 
including any proposed amendments the patent owner wishes to make.
    (c) Any statement filed by the patent owner shall clearly point out 
why the subject matter as claimed is not anticipated or rendered obvious 
by the prior art patents or printed publications, either alone or in any 
reasonable combinations. Where the reexamination request was filed by a 
third party requester, any statement filed by the patent owner must be 
served upon the ex parte reexamination requester in accordance with 
Sec. 1.248.
    (d) Making amendments in a reexamination proceeding. A proposed 
amendment in an ex parte or an inter partes reexamination proceeding is 
made by filing a paper directing that proposed specified changes be made 
to the patent specification, including the claims, or to the drawings. 
An amendment paper directing that proposed specified changes be made in 
a reexamination proceeding may be submitted as an accompaniment to a 
request filed by the patent owner in accordance with Sec. 1.510(e), as 
part of a patent owner statement in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, or, where permitted, during the prosecution of the 
reexamination proceeding pursuant to Sec. 1.550(a) or Sec. 1.937.
    (1) Specification other than the claims. Changes to the 
specification, other than to the claims, must be made by submission of 
the entire text of an added or rewritten paragraph including markings 
pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, except that an entire 
paragraph may be deleted by a statement deleting the paragraph, without 
presentation of the text of the paragraph. The precise point in the 
specification must be identified where any added or rewritten paragraph 
is located. This paragraph applies whether the amendment is submitted on 
paper or compact disc (see Secs. 1.96 and 1.825).
    (2) Claims. An amendment paper must include the entire text of each 
patent claim which is being proposed to be changed by such amendment 
paper and of each new claim being proposed to be added by such amendment 
paper. For any claim changed by the amendment paper, a parenthetical 
expression ``amended,'' ``twice amended,'' etc., should follow the claim 
number. Each patent claim proposed to be changed and each proposed added 
claim must include markings pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, 
except that a patent claim or proposed added claim should be canceled by 
a statement canceling the claim, without presentation of the text of the 
claim.
    (3) Drawings. Any change to the patent drawings must be submitted as 
a sketch on a separate paper showing the proposed changes in red for 
approval by the examiner. Upon approval of the changes by the examiner, 
only new

[[Page 135]]

sheets of drawings including the changes and in compliance with 
Sec. 1.84 must be filed. Amended figures must be identified as 
``Amended,'' and any added figure must be identified as ``New.'' In the 
event a figure is canceled, the figure must be surrounded by brackets 
and identified as ``Canceled.''
    (4) The formal requirements for papers making up the reexamination 
proceeding other than those set forth in this section are set out in 
Sec. 1.52.
    (e) Status of claims and support for claim changes. Whenever there 
is an amendment to the claims pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, 
there must also be supplied, on pages separate from the pages containing 
the changes, the status (i.e., pending or canceled), as of the date of 
the amendment, of all patent claims and of all added claims, and an 
explanation of the support in the disclosure of the patent for the 
changes to the claims made by the amendment paper.
    (f) Changes shown by markings. Any changes relative to the patent 
being reexamined which are made to the specification, including the 
claims, must include the following markings:
    (1) The matter to be omitted by the reexamination proceeding must be 
enclosed in brackets; and
    (2) The matter to be added by the reexamination proceeding must be 
underlined.
    (g) Numbering of patent claims preserved. Patent claims may not be 
renumbered. The numbering of any claims added in the reexamination 
proceeding must follow the number of the highest numbered patent claim.
    (h) Amendment of disclosure may be required. The disclosure must be 
amended, when required by the Office, to correct inaccuracies of 
description and definition, and to secure substantial correspondence 
between the claims, the remainder of the specification, and the 
drawings.
    (i) Amendments made relative to patent. All amendments must be made 
relative to the patent specification, including the claims, and 
drawings, which are in effect as of the date of filing the request for 
reexamination.
    (j) No enlargement of claim scope. No amendment may enlarge the 
scope of the claims of the patent or introduce new matter. No amendment 
may be proposed for entry in an expired patent. Moreover, no amendment, 
other than the cancellation of claims, will be incorporated into the 
patent by a certificate issued after the expiration of the patent.
    (k) Amendments not effective until certificate. Although the Office 
actions will treat proposed amendments as though they have been entered, 
the proposed amendments will not be effective until the reexamination 
certificate is issued.
    (l) Correction of inventorship in an ex parte or inter partes 
reexamination proceeding.
    (1) When it appears in a patent being reexamined that the correct 
inventor or inventors were not named through error without deceptive 
intention on the part of the actual inventor or inventors, the 
Commissioner may, on petition of all the parties set forth in 
Sec. 1.324(b)(1)-(3), including the assignees, and satisfactory proof of 
the facts and payment of the fee set forth in Sec. 1.20(b), or on order 
of a court before which such matter is called in question, include in 
the reexamination certificate to be issued under Sec. 1.570 or 
Sec. 1.977 an amendment naming only the actual inventor or inventors. 
The petition must be submitted as part of the reexamination proceeding 
and must satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.324.
    (2) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph (1)(1) of this section, 
if a petition to correct inventorship satisfying the requirements of 
Sec. 1.324 is filed in a reexamination proceeding, and the reexamination 
proceeding is terminated other than by a reexamination certificate under 
Sec. 1.570 or Sec. 1.977, a certificate of correction indicating the 
change of inventorship stated in the petition will be issued upon 
request by the patentee.

    The failure to timely file or serve the documents set forth in 
Sec. 1.530 or in Sec. 1.535 may result in their being refused 
consideration. No submissions other than the statement pursuant to 
Sec. 1.530 and the reply by the ex parte reexamination requester 
pursuant to Sec. 1.535 will be considered prior to examination.

Sec. 1.550  Conduct of ex parte reexamination proceedings.

    (a) All ex parte reexamination proceedings, including any appeals to 
the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, will be conducted with 
special dispatch within the Office. After issuance of the ex parte 
reexamination order and expiration of the time for submitting any 
responses, the examination will be conducted in accordance with 
Secs. 1.104 through 1.116 and will result in the issuance of an ex parte 
reexamination certificate under Sec. 1.570.
    (b) The patent owner in an ex parte reexamination proceeding will be 
given at least thirty days to respond to any Office action. In response 
to any rejection, such response may include further statements and/or 
proposed amendments or new claims to place the patent in a condition 
where all claims, if amended as proposed, would be patentable.
    (c) The time for taking any action by a patent owner in an ex parte 
reexamination proceeding will be extended only for sufficient cause and 
for a reasonable time specified. Any request for such extension must be 
filed on or before the day on which action by the patent owner is due, 
but in no case will the mere filing of a request effect any extension. 
See Sec. 1.304(a) for extensions of time for filing a notice of appeal 
to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or for commencing 
a civil action.
    (d) If the patent owner fails to file a timely and appropriate 
response to any Office action or any written statement of an interview 
required under Sec. 1.560(b), the ex parte reexamination proceeding will 
be terminated, and the Commissioner will proceed to issue a certificate 
under Sec. 1.570 in accordance with the last action of the Office.
    (e) If a response by the patent owner is not timely filed in the 
Office,
    (1) The delay in filing such response may be excused if it is shown 
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the delay was unavoidable; 
a petition to accept an unavoidably delayed response must be filed in 
compliance with Sec. 1.137(a); or
    (2) The response may nevertheless be accepted if the delay was 
unintentional; a petition to accept an unintentionally delayed response 
must be filed in compliance with Sec. 1.137(b).
    (f) The reexamination requester will be sent copies of Office 
actions issued during the ex parte reexamination proceeding. After 
filing of a request for ex parte reexamination by a third party 
requester, any document filed by either the patent owner or the third 
party requester must be served on the other party in the reexamination 
proceeding in the manner provided by Sec. 1.248. The document must 
reflect service or the document may be refused consideration by the 
Office.
    (g) The active participation of the ex parte reexamination requester 
ends with the reply pursuant to Sec. 1.535, and no further submissions 
on behalf of the reexamination requester will be acknowledged or 
considered. Further, no submissions on behalf of any third parties will 
be acknowledged or considered unless such submissions are:
    (1) in accordance with Sec. 1.510 or Sec. 1.535; or
    (2) entered in the patent file prior to the date of the order for ex 
parte reexamination pursuant to Sec. 1.525.
    (h) Submissions by third parties, filed after the date of the order 
for ex parte reexamination pursuant to Sec. 1.525, must meet the 
requirements of and will be treated in accordance with Sec. 1.501(a).

Sec. 1.552  Scope of reexamination in ex parte reexamination proceedings.

    (a) Claims in an ex parte reexamination proceeding will be examined 
on the basis of patents or printed publications and, with respect to 
subject matter added or deleted in the reexamination proceeding, on the 
basis of the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112.
    (b) Claims in an ex parte reexamination proceeding will not be 
permitted to enlarge the scope of the claims of the patent.
    (c) Issues other than those indicated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section will not be resolved in a reexamination proceeding. If such 
issues are raised by the patent owner or third party requester during a 
reexamination proceeding, the existence of such issues will be noted by 
the examiner in the next Office action, in which case the patent owner 
may consider the advisability of filing a reissue application to have 
such issues considered and resolved.

Sec. 1.555  Information material to patentability in ex parte reexamination and inter partes reexamination proceedings.

    (a) A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. 
The public interest is best served, and the most effective reexamination 
occurs when, at the time a reexamination proceeding is being conducted, 
the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information 
material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding. Each individual 
associated with the patent owner in a reexamination proceeding has a 
duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes 
a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that 
individual to be material to patentability in a reexamination 
proceeding. The individuals who have a duty to disclose to the Office 
all information known to them to be material to patentability in a 
reexamination proceeding are the patent owner, each attorney or agent 
who represents the patent owner, and every other individual who is 
substantively involved on behalf of the patent owner in a reexamination 
proceeding. The duty to disclose the information exists with respect to 
each claim pending in the reexamination proceeding until the claim is 
cancelled. Information material to the patentability of a cancelled 
claim need not be submitted if the information is not material to 
patentability of any claim remaining under consideration in the 
reexamination proceeding. The duty to disclose all information known to 
be material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding is deemed to 
be satisfied if all information known to be material to patentability of 
any claim in the patent after issuance of the reexamination certificate 
was cited by the Office or submitted to the Office in an information 
disclosure statement. However, the duties of candor, good faith, and 
disclosure have not been complied with if any fraud on the Office was 
practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was violated through 
bad faith or intentional misconduct by, or on behalf of, the patent 
owner in the reexamination proceeding. Any information disclosure 
statement must be filed with the items listed in Sec. 1.98(a) as applied 
to individuals associated with the patent owner in a reexamination 
proceeding, and should be filed within two months of the date of the 
order for reexamination, or as soon thereafter as possible.
    (b) Under this section, information is material to patentability in 
a reexamination proceeding when it is not cumulative to information of 
record or being made of record in the reexamination proceeding, and
    (1) It is a patent or printed publication that establishes, by 
itself or in combination with other patents or printed publications, a 
prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim; or
    (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the patent owner 
takes in:
    (i) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, 
or
    (ii) Asserting an argument of patentability.

A prima facie case of unpatentability of a claim pending in a 
reexamination proceeding is established when the information compels a 
conclusion that a claim is unpatentable under the preponderance of 
evidence, burden-of-proof standard, giving each term in the

[[Page 138]]

claim its broadest reasonable construction consistent with the 
specification, and before any consideration is given to evidence which 
may be submitted in an attempt to establish a contrary conclusion of 
patentability.
    (c) The responsibility for compliance with this section rests upon 
the individuals designated in paragraph (a) of this section and no 
evaluation will be made by the Office in the reexamination proceeding as 
to compliance with this section. If questions of compliance with this 
section are raised by the patent owner or the third party requester 
during a reexamination proceeding, they will be noted as unresolved 
questions in accordance with Sec. 1.552(c).

Sec. 1.560  Interviews in ex parte reexamination proceedings.

    (a) Interviews in ex parte reexamination proceedings pending before 
the Office between examiners and the owners of such patents or their 
attorneys or agents of record must be conducted in the Office at such 
times, within Office hours, as the respective examiners may designate. 
Interviews will not be permitted at any other time or place without the 
authority of the Commissioner. Interviews for the discussion of the 
patentability of claims in patents involved in ex parte reexamination 
proceedings will not be conducted prior to the first official action. 
Interviews should be arranged in advance. Requests that reexamination 
requesters participate in interviews with examiners will not be granted.
    (b) In every instance of an interview with an examiner in an ex 
parte reexamination proceeding, a complete written statement of the 
reasons presented at the interview as warranting favorable action must 
be filed by the patent owner. An interview does not remove the necessity 
for response to Office actions as specified in Sec. 1.111. Patent 
owner's response to an outstanding Office action after the interview 
does not remove the necessity for filing the written statement. The 
written statement must be filed as a separate part of a response to an 
Office action outstanding at the time of the interview, or as a separate 
paper within one month from the date of the interview, whichever is 
later.

Sec. 1.565  Concurrent office proceedings which include an ex parte reexamination proceeding.

    (a) In an ex parte reexamination proceeding before the Office, the 
patent owner must inform the Office of any prior or concurrent 
proceedings in which the patent is or was involved such as 
interferences, reissues, ex parte reexaminations, inter partes 
reexaminations, or litigation and the results of such proceedings. See 
Sec. 1.985 for notification of prior or concurrent proceedings in an 
inter partes reexamination proceeding.
    (b) If a patent in the process of ex parte reexamination is or 
becomes involved in litigation, the Commissioner shall determine whether 
or not to suspend the reexamination. See Sec. 1.987 for inter partes 
reexamination proceedings.
    (c) If ex parte reexamination is ordered while a prior ex parte 
reexamination proceeding is pending and prosecution in the prior ex 
parte reexamination proceeding has not been terminated, the ex parte 
reexamination proceedings will be consolidated and result in the 
issuance of a single certificate under Sec. 1.570. For merger of inter 
partes reexamination proceedings, see Sec. 1.989(a). For merger of ex 
parte reexamination and inter partes reexamination proceedings, see 
Sec. 1.989(b).
    (d) If a reissue application and an ex parte reexamination 
proceeding on which an order pursuant to Sec. 1.525 has been mailed are 
pending concurrently on a patent, a decision will normally be made to 
merge the two proceedings or to suspend one of the two proceedings. 
Where merger of a reissue application and an ex parte reexamination 
proceeding is ordered, the merged examination will be conducted in 
accordance with Secs. 1.171 through 1.179, and the patent owner will be 
required to place and maintain the same claims in the reissue 
application and the ex parte reexamination proceeding during the 
pendency of the merged proceeding. The examiner's actions and responses 
by the patent owner in a merged proceeding will apply to both the 
reissue

[[Page 139]]

application and the ex parte reexamination proceeding and be physically 
entered into both files. Any ex parte reexamination proceeding merged 
with a reissue application shall be terminated by the grant of the 
reissued patent. For merger of a reissue application and an inter partes 
reexamination, see Sec. 1.991.
    (e) If a patent in the process of ex parte reexamination is or 
becomes involved in an interference, the Commissioner may suspend the 
reexamination or the interference. The Commissioner will not consider a 
request to suspend an interference unless a motion (Sec. 1.635) to 
suspend the interference has been presented to, and denied by, an 
administrative patent judge, and the request is filed within ten (10) 
days of a decision by an administrative patent judge denying the motion 
for suspension or such other time as the administrative patent judge may 
set. For concurrent inter partes reexamination and interference of a 
patent, see Sec. 1.993.

                   Ex Parte Reexamination Certificate


<R05>
Sec. 1.570  Issuance of ex parte reexamination certificate after ex parte reexamination proceedings.

    (a) Upon the conclusion of ex parte reexamination proceedings, the 
Commissioner will issue an ex parte reexamination certificate in 
accordance with 35 U.S.C. 307 setting forth the results of the ex parte 
reexamination proceeding and the content of the patent following the ex 
parte reexamination proceeding.
    (b) An ex parte reexamination certificate will be issued in each 
patent in which an ex parte reexamination proceeding has been ordered 
under Sec. 1.525 and has not been merged with any inter partes 
reexamination proceeding pursuant to Sec. 1.989(a). Any statutory 
disclaimer filed by the patent owner will be made part of the ex parte 
reexamination certificate.
    (c) The ex parte reexamination certificate will be mailed on the day 
of its date to the patent owner at the address as provided for in 
Sec. 1.33(c). A copy of the ex parte reexamination certificate will also 
be mailed to the requester of the ex parte reexamination proceeding.
    (d) If an ex parte reexamination certificate has been issued which 
cancels all of the claims of the patent, no further Office proceedings 
will be conducted with that patent or any reissue applications or any 
reexamination requests relating thereto.
    (e) If the ex parte reexamination proceeding is terminated by the 
grant of a reissued patent as provided in Sec. 1.565(d), the reissued 
patent will constitute the ex parte reexamination certificate required 
by this section and 35 U.S.C. 307.
    (f) A notice of the issuance of each ex parte reexamination 
certificate under this section will be published in the Official Gazette 
on its date of issuance.

                        Subpart E--Interferences

    Authority: 35 U.S.C. 6, 23, 41, and 135.

    Source: 49 FR 48455, Dec. 12, 1984, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.601  Scope of rules, definitions.

    This subpart governs the procedure in patent interferences in the 
Patent and Trademark Office. This subpart shall be construed to secure 
the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every interference. 
For the meaning of terms in the Federal Rules of Evidence as applied to 
interferences, see Sec. 1.671(c). Unless otherwise clear from the 
context, the following definitions apply to this subpart:
    (a) Additional discovery is discovery to which a party may be 
entitled under Sec. 1.687 in addition to discovery to which the party is 
entitled as a matter of right under Sec. 1.673 (a) and (b).
    (b) Affidavit means affidavit, declaration under Sec. 1.68, or 
statutory declaration under 28 U.S.C. 1746. A transcript of an ex parte 
deposition may be used as an affidavit.
    (c) Board means the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.
    (d) Case-in-chief means that portion of a party's case where the 
party has the burden of going forward with evidence.
    (e) Case-in-rebuttal means that portion of a party's case where the 
party presents evidence in rebuttal to the case-in-chief of another 
party.
    (f) A count defines the interfering subject matter between two or 
more applications or between one or more

[[Page 140]]

applications and one or more patents. When there is more than one count, 
each count shall define a separate patentable invention. Any claim of an 
application or patent that is designated to correspond to a count is a 
claim involved in the interference within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 
135(a). A claim of a patent or application that is designated to 
correspond to a count and is identical to the count is said to 
correspond exactly to the count. A claim of a patent or application that 
is designated to correspond to a count but is not identical to the count 
is said to correspond substantially to the count. When a count is 
broader in scope than all claims which correspond to the count, the 
count is a phantom count.
    (g) The effective filing date of an application is the filing date 
of an earlier application, benefit of which is accorded to the 
application under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121, or 365 or, if no benefit is 
accorded, the filing date of the application. The effective filing date 
of a patent is the filing date of an earlier application, benefit of 
which is accorded to the patent under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121, or 365 
or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application which 
issued as the patent.
    (h) In the case of an application, filing date means the filing date 
assigned to the application. In the case of a patent, ``filing date'' 
means the filing date assigned to the application which issued as the 
patent.
    (i) An interference is a proceeding instituted in the Patent and 
Trademark Office before the Board to determine any question of 
patentability and priority of invention between two or more parties 
claiming the same patentable invention. An interference may be declared 
between two or more pending applications naming different inventors 
when, in the opinion of an examiner, the applications contain claims for 
the same patentable invention. An interference may be declared between 
one or more pending applications and one or more unexpired patents 
naming different inventors when, in the opinion of an examiner, any 
application and any unexpired patent contain claims for the same 
patentable invention.
    (j) An interference-in-fact exists when at least one claim of a 
party that is designated to correspond to a count and at least one claim 
of an opponent that is designated to correspond to the count define the 
same patentable invention.
    (k) A lead attorney or agent is a registered attorney or agent of 
record who is primarily responsible for prosecuting an interference on 
behalf of a party and is the attorney or agent whom an administrative 
patent judge may contact to set times and take other action in the 
interference.
    (l) A party is an applicant or patentee involved in the interference 
or a legal representative or an assignee of record in the Patent and 
Trademark Office of an applicant or patentee involved in an 
interference. Where acts of party are normally performed by an attorney 
or agent, ``party'' may be construed to mean the attorney or agent. An 
inventor is the individual named as inventor in an application involved 
in an interference or the individual named as inventor in a patent 
involved in an interference.
    (m) A senior party is the party with the earliest effective filing 
date as to all counts or, if there is no party with the earliest 
effective filing date as to all counts, the party with the earliest 
filing date. A junior party is any other party.
    (n) Invention ``A'' is the same patentable invention as an invention 
``B'' when invention ``A'' is the same as (35 U.S.C. 102) or is obvious 
(35 U.S.C. 103) in view of invention ``B'' assuming invention ``B'' is 
prior art with respect to invention ``A''. Invention ``A'' is a separate 
patentable invention with respect to invention ``B'' when invention 
``A'' is new (35 U.S.C. 102) and non-obvious (35 U.S.C. 103) in view of 
invention ``B'' assuming invention ``B'' is prior art with respect to 
invention ``A''.
    (o) Sworn means sworn or affirmed.
    (p) United States means the United States of America, its 
territories and possessions.
    (q) A final decision is a decision awarding judgment as to all 
counts. An interlocutory order is any other action taken by an 
administrative patent judge or the Board in an interference,

[[Page 141]]

including the notice declaring an interference.
    (r) NAFTA country means NAFTA country as defined in section 2(4) of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Pub. L. 103-
182, 107 Stat. 2060 (19 U.S.C. 3301).
    (s) WTO member country means WTO member country as defined in 
section 2(10) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Pub. L. 103-465, 108 
Stat. 4813 (19 U.S.C. 3501).

    (b) The parties, within 20 days after an interference is declared, 
shall notify the Board of any and all right, title, and interest in any 
application or patent involved or relied upon in the interference unless 
the right, title, and interest is set forth in the notice declaring the 
interference.
    (c) If a change of any right, title, and interest in any application 
or patent involved or relied upon in the interference occurs after 
notice is given declaring the interference and before the time expires 
for seeking judicial review of a final decision of the Board, the 
parties shall notify the Board of the change within 20 days after the 
change.

    Before an interference is declared between two or more applications, 
the examiner must be of the opinion that there is interfering subject 
matter claimed in the applications which is patentable to each applicant 
subject to a judgment in the interference. The interfering subject 
matter shall be defined by one or more counts. Each application must 
contain, or be amended to contain, at least one claim that is patentable 
over the prior art and corresponds to each count. All claims in the 
applications which define the same patentable invention as a count shall 
be designated to correspond to the count.

corresponding to the proposed count or identifying at least one claim in 
its application that corresponds to the proposed count,
    (2) Identifying the other application and, if known, a claim in the 
other application which corresponds to the proposed count, and
    (3) Explaining why an interference should be declared.
    (b) When an applicant presents a claim known to the applicant to 
define the same patentable invention claimed in a pending application of 
another, the applicant shall identify that pending application, unless 
the claim is presented in response to a suggestion by the examiner. The 
examiner shall notify the Commissioner of any instance where it appears 
an applicant may have failed to comply with the provisions of this 
paragraph.

Sec. 1.605  Suggestion of claim to applicant by examiner.

    (a) If no claim in an application is drawn to the same patentable 
invention claimed in another application or patent, the examiner may 
suggest that an applicant present a claim drawn to an invention claimed 
in another application or patent for the purpose of an interference with 
another application or a patent. The applicant to whom the claim is 
suggested shall amend the application by presenting the suggested claim 
within a time specified by the examiner, not less than one month. 
Failure or refusal of an applicant to timely present the suggested claim 
shall be taken without further action

[[Page 142]]

as a disclaimer by the applicant of the invention defined by the 
suggested claim. At the time the suggested claim is presented, the 
applicant may also call the examiner's attention to other claims already 
in the application or presented with the suggested claim and explain why 
the other claims would be more appropriate to be designated to 
correspond to a count in any interference which may be declared.
    (b) The suggestion of a claim by the examiner for the purpose of an 
interference will not stay the period for response to any outstanding 
Office action. When a suggested claim is timely presented, ex parte 
proceedings in the application will be stayed pending a determination of 
whether an interference will be declared.

Sec. 1.606  Interference between an application and a patent; subject matter of the interference.

    Before an interference is declared between an application and an 
unexpired patent, an examiner must determine that there is interfering 
subject matter claimed in the application and the patent which is 
patentable to the applicant subject to a judgment in the interference. 
The interfering subject matter will be defined by one or more counts. 
The application must contain, or be amended to contain, at least one 
claim that is patentable over the prior art and corresponds to each 
count. The claim in the application need not be, and most often will not 
be, identical to a claim in the patent. All claims in the application 
and patent which define the same patentable invention as a count shall 
be designated to correspond to the count.

Sec. 1.607  Request by applicant for interference with patent.

    (a) An applicant may seek to have an interference declared between 
an application and an unexpired patent by,
    (1) Identifying the patent,
    (2) Presenting a proposed count,
    (3) Identifying at least one claim in the patent corresponding to 
the proposed count,
    (4) Presenting at least one claim corresponding to the proposed 
count or identifying at least one claim already pending in its 
application that corresponds to the proposed count, and, if any claim of 
the patent or application identified as corresponding to the proposed 
count does not correspond exactly to the proposed count, explaining why 
each such claim corresponds to the proposed count, and
    (5) Applying the terms of any application claim,
    (i) Identified as corresponding to the count, and
    (ii) Not previously in the application to the disclosure of the 
application.
    (6) Explaining how the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 135(b) are met, if 
the claim presented or identified under paragraph (a)(4) of this section 
was not present in the application until more than one year after the 
issue date of the patent.
    (b) When an applicant seeks an interference with a patent, 
examination of the application, including any appeal to the Board, shall 
be conducted with special dispatch within the Patent and Trademark 
Office. The examiner shall determine whether there is interfering 
subject matter claimed in the application and the patent which is 
patentable to the applicant subject to a judgment in an interference. If 
the examiner determines that there is any interfering subject matter, an 
interference will be declared. If the examiner determines that there is 
no interfering subject matter, the examiner shall state the reasons why 
an interference is not being declared and otherwise act on the 
application.
    (c) When an applicant presents a claim which corresponds exactly or 
substantially to a claim of a patent, the applicant shall identify the 
patent and the number of the patent claim, unless the claim is presented 
in response to a suggestion by the examiner. The examiner shall notify 
the Commissioner of any instance where an applicant fails to identify 
the patent.
    (d) A notice that an applicant is seeking to provoke an interference 
with a patent will be placed in the file of the patent and a copy of the 
notice

[[Page 143]]

will be sent to the patentee. The identity of the applicant will not be 
disclosed unless an interference is declared. If a final decision is 
made not to declare an interference, a notice to that effect will be 
placed in the patent file and will be sent to the patentee.

Sec. 1.608  Interference between an application and a patent; prima facie showing by applicant.

    (a) When the effective filing date of an application is three months 
or less after the effective filing date of a patent, before an 
interference will be declared, either the applicant or the applicant's 
attorney or agent of record shall file a statement alleging that there 
is a basis upon which the applicant is entitled to a judgment relative 
to the patentee.
    (b) When the effective filing date of an application is more than 
three months after the effective filing date of a patent, the applicant, 
before an interference will be declared, shall file evidence which may 
consist of patents or printed publications, other documents, and one or 
more affidavits which demonstrate that applicant is prima facie entitled 
to a judgment relative to the patentee and an explanation stating with 
particularity the basis upon which the applicant is prima facie entitled 
to the judgment. Where the basis upon which an applicant is entitled to 
judgment relative to a patentee is priority of invention, the evidence 
shall include affidavits by the applicant, if possible, and one or more 
corroborating witnesses, supported by documentary evidence, if 
available, each setting out a factual description of acts and 
circumstances performed or observed by the affiant, which collectively 
would prima facie entitle the applicant to judgment on priority with 
respect to the effective filing date of the patent. To facilitate 
preparation of a record (Sec. 1.653(g)) for final hearing, an applicant 
should file affidavits on paper which is 21.8 by 27.9 cm. (8\1/2\ x 11 
inches). The significance of any printed publication or other document 
which is self-authenticating within the meaning of Rule 902 of the 
Federal Rules of Evidence or Sec. 1.671(d) and any patent shall be 
discussed in an affidavit or the explanation. Any printed publication or 
other document which is not self-authenticating shall be authenticated 
and discussed with particularity in an affidavit. Upon a showing of good 
cause, an affidavit may be based on information and belief. If an 
examiner finds an application to be in condition for declaration of an 
interference, the examiner will consider the evidence and explanation 
only to the extent of determining whether a basis upon which the 
application would be entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee is 
alleged and, if a basis is alleged, an interference may be declared.

Sec. 1.610  Assignment of interference to administrative patent judge, time period for completing interference.

    (a) Each interference will be declared by an administrative patent 
judge who may enter all interlocutory orders in the interference, except 
that only the Board shall hear oral argument at final hearing, enter a 
decision under Sec. 1.617, 1.640(e), 1.652, 1.656(i) or 1.658, or enter 
any other order which terminates the interference.
    (b) As necessary, another administrative patent judge may act in 
place of the one who declared the interference. At the discretion of the 
administrative patent judge assigned to the interference, a panel 
consisting of two or more members of the Board may enter interlocutory 
orders.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, times for taking 
action by a party in the interference will be set on a case-by-case 
basis by the administrative patent judge assigned to the interference. 
Times for taking action shall be set and the administrative patent judge 
shall exercise control over the interference such that the pendency of 
the interference before the Board does not normally exceed two years.
    (d) An administrative patent judge may hold a conference with the 
parties to consider simplification of any issues, the necessity or 
desirability of amendments to counts, the possibility of obtaining 
admissions of fact and

[[Page 144]]

genuineness of documents which will avoid unnecessary proof, any 
limitations on the number of expert witnesses, the time and place for 
conducting a deposition (Sec. 1.673(g)), and any other matter as may aid 
in the disposition of the interference. After a conference, the 
administrative patent judge may enter any order which may be 
appropriate.

    (a) An administrative patent judge or the Board may impose an 
appropriate sanction against a party who fails to comply with the 
regulations of this part or any order entered by an administrative 
patent judge or the Board. An appropriate sanction may include among 
others entry of an order:
    (1) Holding certain facts to have been established in the 
interference;
    (2) Precluding a party from filing a paper;
    (3) Precluding a party from presenting or contesting a particular 
issue;
    (4) Precluding a party from requesting, obtaining, or opposing 
discovery;

has authorized a party to compel the taking of testimony or the 
production of documents or things from an individual or entity located 
in a NAFTA country or a WTO member country concerning

[[Page 146]]

knowledge, use, or other activity relevant to proving or disproving a 
date of invention (Sec. 1.671(h)), but the testimony, documents or 
things have not been produced for use in the interference to the same 
extent as such information could be made available in the United States, 
the administrative patent judge or the Board shall draw such adverse 
inferences as may be appropriate under the circumstances, or take such 
other action permitted by statute, rule, or regulation, in favor of the 
party that requested the information in the interference, including 
imposition of appropriate sanctions under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) A party may file a motion (Sec. 1.635) for entry of an order 
imposing sanctions, the drawing of adverse inferences or other action

patent judge or the Board on its own initiative determines that a 
sanction, adverse inference or other action against a party may be 
appropriate under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section, the 
administrative patent judge or the Board shall enter an order for the 
party to show cause why the sanction, adverse inference or other action 
is not appropriate. The Board shall take action in accordance with the 
order unless, within 20 days after the date of the order, the party 
files a paper which shows good cause why the sanction, adverse inference 
or other action would not be appropriate.

Sec. 1.617  Summary judgment against applicant.

    (a) An administrative patent judge shall review any evidence filed 
by an applicant under Sec. 1.608(b) to determine if the applicant is 
prima facie entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee. If the 
administrative patent judge determines that the evidence shows the 
applicant is prima facie entitled to a judgment relative to the 
patentee, the interference shall proceed in the normal manner under the 
regulations of this part. If in the opinion of the administrative patent 
judge the evidence fails to show that the applicant is prima facie 
entitled to a judgment relative to the patentee, the administrative 
patent judge shall, concurrently with the notice declaring the 
interference, enter an order stating the reasons for the opinion and 
directing the applicant, within a time set in the order, to show cause 
why summary judgment should not be entered against the applicant.
    (b) The applicant may file a response to the order, which may 
include an appropriate preliminary motion under Sec. 1.633 (c), (f) or 
(g), and state any reasons why summary judgment should not be entered. 
Any request by the applicant for a hearing before the Board shall be 
made in the response. Additional evidence shall not be presented by the 
applicant or considered by the Board unless the applicant shows good 
cause why any additional evidence was not initially presented with the 
evidence filed under Sec. 1.608(b). At the time an applicant files a 
response, the applicant shall serve a copy of any evidence filed under 
Sec. 1.608(b) and this paragraph.
    (c) If a response is not timely filed by the applicant, the Board 
shall enter a final decision granting summary judgment against the 
applicant.
    (d) If a response is timely filed by the applicant, all opponents 
may file a statement and may oppose any preliminary motion filed under 
Sec. 1.633 (c), (f) or (g) by the applicant within a time set by the 
administrative patent judge. The statement may set forth views as to why 
summary judgment should be granted against the applicant, but the 
statement shall be limited to discussing why all the evidence presented 
by the applicant does not overcome the reasons given by the 
administrative patent judge for issuing the order to show cause. Except 
as required to oppose a motion under Sec. 1.633 (c), (f) or (g) by the 
applicant, evidence shall not be filed by any opponent. An opponent may 
not request a hearing.
    (e) Within a time authorized by the administrative patent judge, an 
applicant may file a reply to any statement or opposition filed by any 
opponent.
    (f) When more than two parties are involved in an interference, all 
parties may participate in summary judgment proceedings under this 
section.
    (g) If a response by the applicant is timely filed, the 
administrative patent judge or the Board shall decide whether

[[Page 147]]

the evidence submitted under Sec. 1.608(b) and any additional evidence 
properly submitted under paragraphs (b) and (e) of this section shows 
that the applicant is prima facie entitled to a judgment relative to the 
patentee. If the applicant is not prima facie entitled to a judgment 
relative to the patentee, the Board shall enter a final decision 
granting summary judgment against the applicant. Otherwise, an 
interlocutory order shall be entered authorizing the interference to 
proceed in the normal manner under the regulations of this subpart.
    (h) Only an applicant who filed evidence under Sec. 1.608(b) may 
request a hearing. If that applicant requests a hearing, the Board may 
hold a hearing prior to entry of a decision under paragraph (g) of this 
section. The administrative patent judge shall set a date and time for 
the hearing. Unless otherwise ordered by the administrative patent judge 
or the Board, the applicant and any opponent will each be entitled to no 
more than 30 minutes of oral argument at the hearing.

Sec. 1.618  Return of unauthorized papers.

    (a) An administrative patent judge or the Board shall return to a 
party any paper presented by the party when the filing of the paper is 
not authorized by, or is not in compliance with the requirements of, 
this subpart. Any paper returned will not thereafter be considered in 
the interference. A party may be permitted to file a corrected paper 
under such conditions as may be deemed appropriate by an administrative 
patent judge or the Board.
    (b) When presenting a paper in an interference, a party shall not 
submit with the paper a copy of a paper previously filed in the 
interference.

Sec. 1.633  Preliminary motions.

    A party may file the following preliminary motions:
    (a) A motion for judgment against an opponent's claim designated to 
correspond to a count on the ground that the claim is not patentable to 
the opponent. The motion shall separately address each claim alleged to 
be unpatentable. In deciding an issue raised in a motion filed under 
this paragraph (a), a claim will be construed in light of the 
specification of the application or patent in which it appears. A motion 
under this paragraph shall not be based on:
    (1) Priority of invention by the moving party as against any 
opponent or
    (2) Derivation of the invention by an opponent from the moving 
party. See Sec. 1.637(a).
    (b) A motion for judgment on the ground that there is no 
interference-in-fact. A motion under this paragraph is proper only if 
the interference involves a design application or patent or a plant 
application or patent or no claim of a party which corresponds to a 
count is identical to any claim of an opponent which corresponds to that 
count. See Sec. 1.637(a). When claims of different parties are presented 
in ``means plus function'' format, it may be possible for the claims of 
the different parties not to define the same patentable invention even 
though the claims contain the same literal wording.
    (c) A motion to redefine the interfering subject matter by (1) 
adding or substituting a count, (2) amending an application claim 
corresponding to a count or adding a claim in the moving party's 
application to be designated to correspond to a count, (3) designating 
an application or patent claim to correspond to a count, (4) designating 
an application or patent claim as not corresponding to a count, or (5) 
requiring an opponent who is an applicant to add a claim and to 
designate the claim to correspond to a count. See Sec. 1.637 (a) and 
(c).
    (d) A motion to substitute a different application owned by a party 
for an application involved in the interference. See Sec. 1.637 (a) and 
(d).
    (e) A motion to declare an additional interference (1) between an 
additional application not involved in the interference and owned by a 
party and an opponent's application or patent involved in the 
interference or (2) when an interference involves three or more parties, 
between less than all applications and any patent involved in the 
interference. See Sec. 1.637 (a) and (e).
    (f) A motion to be accorded the benefit of the filing date of an 
earlier filed application. See Sec. 1.637 (a) and (f).
    (g) A motion to attack the benefit accorded an opponent in the 
notice declaring the interference of the filing date of an earlier filed 
application. See Sec. 1.637 (a) and (g).
    (h) When a patent is involved in an interference and the patentee 
has on file or files an application for reissue under Sec. 1.171, a 
motion to add the application for reissue to the interference. See 
Sec. 1.637 (a) and (h).
    (i) When a motion is filed under paragraph (a), (b), or (g) of this 
section, an opponent, in addition to opposing the motion, may file a 
motion to redefine the interfering subject matter under paragraph (c) of 
this section, a motion to substitute a different application under 
paragraph (d) of this section, or a motion to add a reissue application 
to the interference under paragraph (h) of this section.
    (j) When a motion is filed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section an 
opponent, in addition to opposing the motion, may file a motion for 
benefit under paragraph (f) of this section as to the count to be added 
or substituted.

involved in an interference unless otherwise ordered by an 
administrative patent judge.
    (d) A motion under Sec. 1.635 shall be filed as specified in this 
subpart or when appropriate unless otherwise ordered by an 
administrative patent judge.

is entitled to the relief sought in the motion. Each motion shall 
include a statement of the precise relief requested, a statement of the 
material facts in support of the motion, in numbered paragraphs, and a 
full statement of the reasons why the relief requested should be 
granted. If a party files a motion for judgment under Sec. 1.633(a) 
against an opponent based on the ground of unpatentability over prior 
art, and the dates of the cited prior art are such that the prior art 
appears to be applicable to the party, it will be presumed, without 
regard to the dates alleged in the preliminary statement of the party, 
that the cited prior art is applicable to the party unless there is 
included with the motion an explanation, and evidence if appropriate, as 
to why the prior art does not apply to the party.
    (b) Unless otherwise ordered by an administrative patent judge or 
the Board, a motion under Sec. 1.635 shall contain a certificate by the 
moving party stating that the moving party has conferred with all 
opponents in an effort in good faith to resolve by agreement the issues 
raised by the motion. The certificate shall indicate whether any 
opponent plans to oppose the motion. The provisions of this paragraph do

party shall show the patentability of any proposed claims to the 
opponent and apply the terms of the claims to the disclosure of the 
opponent's application.
    (iv) Designate the claims of any patent involved in the interference 
which define the same patentable invention as each proposed count.
    (v) Show that each proposed count defines a separate patentable 
invention from every other count proposed to remain in the interference.
    (vi) Be accompanied by a motion under Sec. 1.633(f) requesting the

each count and apply the terms of the claims to the disclosure of the 
different application; when necessary the applicant shall file with the 
motion an amendment adding a claim to the different application.
    (e) A preliminary motion to declare an additional interference under 
Sec. 1.633(e) shall explain why an additional interference is necessary.
    (1) When the preliminary motion seeks an additional interference 
under Sec. 1.633(e)(1), the motion shall:

Sec. 1.639  Evidence in support of motion, opposition, or reply.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this 
section, proof of any material fact alleged in a motion, opposition, or 
reply must be filed and served with the motion, opposition, or reply 
unless the proof relied upon is part of the interference file or the 
file of any patent or application involved in the interference or any 
earlier application filed in the United States of which a party has been 
accorded or seeks to be accorded benefit.
    (b) Proof may be in the form of patents, printed publications, and 
affidavits. The pages of any affidavits filed under this paragraph 
shall, to the extent possible, be given sequential numbers, which shall 
also serve as the record page numbers for the affidavits in the event 
they are included in the party's record (Sec. 1.653). Any patents and 
printed publications submitted under this paragraph and any exhibits 
identified in affidavits submitted under this paragraph shall, to the 
extent possible, be given sequential exhibit numbers, which shall also

<R05>
Sec. 1.640  Motions, hearing and decision, redeclaration of interference, order to show cause.

    (a) A hearing on a motion may be held in the discretion of the 
administrative patent judge. The administrative patent judge shall set 
the date and time for any hearing. The length of oral argument at a 
hearing on a motion is a matter within the discretion of the 
administrative patent judge. An administrative patent judge may direct 
that a hearing take place by telephone.
    (b) Unless an administrative patent judge or the Board is of the 
opinion that an earlier decision on a preliminary motion would 
materially advance the resolution of the interference, decision on a 
preliminary motion shall be deferred to final hearing. Motions not 
deferred to final hearing will be decided by an administrative patent 
judge. An administrative patent judge may consult with an examiner in 
deciding motions. An administrative patent judge may take up motions for 
decisions in any order, may grant, deny, or dismiss any motion, and may 
take such other action which will secure the just, speedy, and 
inexpensive determination of the interference. A matter raised by a 
party in support of or in opposition to a motion that is deferred to 
final hearing will not be entitled to consideration at final hearing 
unless the matter is raised in the party's brief at final hearing. If 
the administrative patent judge determines that the interference shall 
proceed to final hearing on the issue of priority or derivation, a time 
shall be set for each party to file a paper identifying any decisions on 
motions or on matters raised sua sponte by the administrative patent 
judge that the party wishes to have reviewed at final hearing as well as 
identifying any deferred motions that the party wishes to have 
considered at final hearing. Any evidence that a party wishes to have 
considered with respect to the decisions and deferred motions identified 
by the party or by an opponent for consideration or review at final 
hearing shall be filed or, if appropriate, noticed under Sec. 1.671(e) 
during the testimony-in-chief period of the party.
    (1) When appropriate after the time expires for filing replies to 
oppositions to preliminary motions, the administrative patent judge will 
set a time for filing any amendment to an application involved in the 
interference and for filing a supplemental preliminary statement as to 
any new counts which may become involved in the interference if a 
preliminary motion to amend or substitute a count has been filed. 
Failure or refusal of a party to timely present an amendment required by 
an administrative patent judge shall be taken without further action as 
a disclaimer by that party of the invention involved. A supplemental 
preliminary statement shall meet the requirements specified in 
Sec. 1.623, 1.624, 1.625, or 1.626, but need not be filed if a party 
states that it intends to rely on a preliminary statement previously 
filed under Sec. 1.621(a). At an appropriate time in the interference, 
and when necessary, an order will be entered redeclaring the 
interference.
    (2) After the time expires for filing preliminary motions, a further 
preliminary motion under Sec. 1.633 will not be considered except as 
provided by Sec. 1.645(b).
    (c) When a decision on any motion under Sec. 1.633, 1.634, or 1.635 
or on any matter raised sua sponte by an administrative patent judge is 
entered which does not result in the issuance of an order to show cause 
under paragraph (d) of this section, a party may file a request for 
reconsideration within 14 days after the date of the decision. The 
request for reconsideration shall be filed and served by hand or Express 
Mail. The filing of a request for reconsideration will not stay any time 
period set by the decision. The request for reconsideration shall 
specify with particularity the points believed to have been 
misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the decision. No

[[Page 157]]

opposition to a request for reconsideration shall be filed unless 
requested by an administrative patent judge or the Board. A decision 
ordinarily will not be modified unless an opposition has been requested 
by an administrative patent judge or the Board. The request for 
reconsideration normally will be acted on by the administrative patent 
judge or the panel of the Board which issued the decision.
    (d) An administrative patent judge may issue an order to show cause 
why judgment should not be entered against a party when:
    (1) A decision on a motion or on a matter raised sua sponte by an 
administrative patent judge is entered which is dispositive of the 
interference against the party as to any count;
    (2) The party is a junior party who fails to file a preliminary 
statement; or
    (3) The party is a junior party whose preliminary statement fails to 
overcome the effective filing date of another party.
    (e) When an order to show cause is issued under paragraph (d) of 
this section, the Board shall enter judgment in accordance with the 
order unless, within 20 days after the date of the order, the party 
against whom the order issued files a paper which shows good cause why 
judgment should not be entered in accordance with the order.
    (1) If the order was issued under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
the paper may:
    (i) Request that final hearing be set to review any decision which 
is the basis for the order as well as any other decision of the 
administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed by 
the Board at final hearing or
    (ii) Fully explain why judgment should not be entered.
    (2) Any opponent may file a response to the paper within 20 days of 
the date of service of the paper. If the order was issued under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the party's paper includes a 
request for final hearing, the opponent's response must identify every 
decision of the administrative patent judge that the opponent wishes to 
have reviewed by the Board at a final hearing. If the order was issued 
under paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the paper does not include a 
request for final hearing, the opponent's response may include a request 
for final hearing, which must identify every decision of the 
administrative patent judge that the opponent wishes to have reviewed by 
the Board at a final hearing. Where only the opponent's response 
includes a request for a final hearing, the party filing the paper 
shall, within 14 days from the date of service of the opponent's 
response, file a reply identifying any other decision of the 
administrative patent judge that the party wishes to have reviewed by 
the Board at a final hearing.
    (3) The paper or the response should be accompanied by a motion 
(Sec. 1.635) requesting a testimony period if either party wishes to 
introduce any evidence to be considered at final hearing (Sec. 1.671). 
Any evidence that a party wishes to have considered with respect to the 
decisions and deferred motions identified for consideration or review at 
final hearing shall be filed or, if appropriate, noticed under 
Sec. 1.671(e) during the testimony period of the party. A request for a 
testimony period shall be construed as including a request for final 
hearing.
    (4) If the paper contains an explanation of why judgment should not 
be entered in accordance with the order, and if no party has requested a 
final hearing, the decision that is the basis for the order shall be 
reviewed based on the contents of the paper and the response. If the 
paper fails to show good cause, the Board shall enter judgment against 
the party against whom the order issued.

Sec. 1.641  Unpatentability discovered by administrative patent judge.

    (a) During the pendency of an interference, if the administrative 
patent judge becomes aware of a reason why a claim designated to 
correspond to a count may not be patentable, the administrative patent 
judge may enter an order notifying the parties of the reason and set a 
time within which each party may present its views, including any 
argument and any supporting evidence, and, in the case of the party 
whose claim may be unpatentable, any

[[Page 158]]

appropriate preliminary motions under Secs. 1.633 (c), (d) and (h).
    (b) If a party timely files a preliminary motion in response to the 
order of the administrative patent judge, any opponent may file an 
opposition (Sec. 1.638(a)). If an opponent files an opposition, the 
party may reply (Sec. 1.638(b)).
    (c) After considering any timely filed views, including any timely 
filed preliminary motions under Sec. 1.633, oppositions and replies, the 
administrative patent judge shall decide how the interference shall 
proceed.

    During the pendency of an interference, if the administrative patent 
judge becomes aware of an application or a patent not involved in the

the interference, the administrative patent judge may add the 
application or patent to the interference on such terms as may be fair 
to all parties.

Sec. 1.643  Prosecution of interference by assignee.

    (a) An assignee of record in the Patent and Trademark Office of the 
entire interest in an application or patent involved in an interference 
is entitled to conduct prosecution of the interference to the exclusion 
of the inventor.
    (b) An assignee of a part interest in an application or patent 
involved in an interference may file a motion (Sec. 1.635) for entry of 
an order authorizing it to prosecute the interference. The motion shall 
show the inability or refusal of the inventor to prosecute the 
interference or other cause why it is in the interest of justice to 
permit the assignee of a part interest to prosecute the interference. 
The administrative patent judge may allow the assignee of a part 
interest to prosecute the interference upon such terms as may be 
appropriate.

Sec. 1.644  Petitions in interferences.

    (a) There is no appeal to the Commissioner in an interference from a 
decision of an administrative patent judge or the Board. The 
Commissioner will not consider a petition in an interference unless:
    (1) The petition is from a decision of an administrative patent 
judge or the Board and the administrative patent judge or the Board 
shall be of the opinion that the decision involves a controlling 
question of procedure or an interpretation of a rule as to which there 
is a substantial ground for a difference of opinion and that an 
immediate decision on petition by the Commissioner may materially 
advance the ultimate termination of the interference;
    (2) The petition seeks to invoke the supervisory authority of the 
Commissioner and does not relate to the merits of priority of invention 
or patentability or the admissibility of evidence under the Federal 
Rules of Evidence; or
    (3) The petition seeks relief under Sec. 1.183.
    (b) A petition under paragraph (a)(1) of this section filed more 
than 15 days after the date of the decision of the administrative patent 
judge or the Board may be dismissed as untimely. A petition under 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not be filed prior to the party's 
brief for final hearing (see Sec. 1.656). Any petition under paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section shall be timely if it is filed simultaneously 
with a proper motion under Sec. 1.633, 1.634, or 1.635 when granting the 
motion would require waiver of a rule. Any opposition to a petition 
under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section shall be filed within 
20 days of the date of service of the petition. Any opposition to a 
petition under paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be filed within 20 
days of the date of service of the petition or the date an opposition to 
the motion is due, whichever is earlier.
    (c) The filing of a petition shall not stay the proceeding unless a 
stay is granted in the discretion of the administrative patent judge, 
the Board, or the Commissioner.
    (d) Any petition must contain a statement of the facts involved, in 
numbered paragraphs, and the point or

[[Page 159]]

points to be reviewed and the action requested. The petition will be 
decided on the basis of the record made before the administrative patent 
judge or the Board, and no new evidence will be considered by the 
Commissioner in deciding the petition. Copies of documents already of 
record in the interference shall not be submitted with the petition or 
opposition.
    (e) Any petition under paragraph (a) of this section shall be 
accompanied by the petition fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(h).
    (f) Any request for reconsideration of a decision by the 
Commissioner shall be filed within 14 days of the decision of the 
Commissioner and must be accompanied by the fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(h). No opposition to a request for reconsideration shall be 
filed unless requested by the Commissioner. The decision will not 
ordinarily be modified unless such an opposition has been requested by 
the Commissioner.
    (g) Where reasonably possible, service of any petition, opposition, 
or request for reconsideration shall be such that delivery is 
accomplished within one working day. Service by hand or Express Mail 
complies with this paragraph.
    (h) An oral hearing on the petition will not be granted except when 
considered necessary by the Commissioner.
    (i) The Commissioner may delegate to appropriate Patent and 
Trademark Office employees the determination of petitions under this 
section.

Sec. 1.645  Extension of time, late papers, stay of proceedings.

    (a) Except to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or for commencing a civil 
action, a party may file a motion (Sec. 1.635) seeking an extension of 
time to take action in an interference. See Sec. 1.304(a) for extensions 
of time for filing a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit or for commencing a civil action. The motion shall 
be filed within sufficient time to actually reach the administrative 
patent judge before expiration of the time for taking action. A moving 
party should not assume that the motion will be granted even if there is 
no objection by any other party. The motion will be denied unless the 
moving party shows good cause why an extension should be granted. The 
press of other business arising after an administrative patent judge 
sets a time for taking action will not normally constitute good cause. A 
motion seeking additional time to take testimony because a party has not 
been able to procure the testimony of a witness shall set forth the name 
of the witness, any steps taken to procure the testimony of the witness, 
the dates on which the steps were taken, and the facts expected to be 
proved through the witness.
    (b) Any paper belatedly filed will not be considered except upon 
notion (Sec. 1.635) which shows good cause why the paper was not timely 
filed, or where an administrative patent judge or the Board, sua sponte, 
is of the opinion that it would be in the interest of justice to 
consider the paper. See Sec. 1.304(a) for exclusive procedures relating 
to belated filing of a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit or belated commencement of a civil action.
    (c) The provisions of Sec. 1.136 do not apply to time periods in 
interferences.
    (d) An administrative patent judge may stay proceedings in an 
interference.

Sec. 1.646  Service of papers, proof of service.

    (a) A copy of every paper filed in the Patent and Trademark Office 
in an interference or an application or patent involved in the 
interference shall be served upon all other parties except:
    (1) Preliminary statements when filed under Sec. 1.621; preliminary 
statements shall be served when service is ordered by an administrative 
patent judge.
    (2) Certified transcripts and exhibits which accompany the 
transcripts filed under Sec. 1.676; copies of transcripts shall be 
served as part of a party's record under Sec. 1.653(c).

[[Page 160]]

    (b) Service shall be on an attorney or agent for a party. If there 
is no attorney or agent for the party, service shall be on the party. An 
administrative patent judge may order additional service or waive 
service where appropriate.
    (c) Unless otherwise ordered by an administrative patent judge, or 
except as otherwise provided by this subpart, service of a paper shall 
be made as follows:
    (1) By handing a copy of the paper or causing a copy of the paper to 
be handed to the person served.
    (2) By leaving a copy of the paper with someone employed by the 
person at the person's usual place of business.
    (3) When the person served has no usual place of business, by 
leaving a copy of the paper at the person's residence with someone of 
suitable age and discretion then residing therein.
    (4) By mailing a copy of the paper by first class mail; when service 
is by first class mail the date of mailing is regarded as the date of 
service.
    (5) By mailing a copy of the paper by Express Mail; when service is 
by Express Mail the date of deposit with the U.S. Postal Service is 
regarded as the date of service.
    (6) When it is shown to the satisfaction of an administrative patent 
judge that none of the above methods of obtaining or serving the copy of 
the paper was successful, the administrative patent judge may order 
service by publication of an appropriate notice in the Official Gazette.
    (d) An administrative patent judge may order that a paper be served 
by hand or Express Mail.
    (e) The due date for serving a paper is the same as the due date for 
filing the paper in the Patent and Trademark Office. Proof of service 
must be made before a paper will be considered in an interference. Proof 
of service may appear on or be affixed to the paper. Proof of service 
shall include the date and manner of service. In the case of personal 
service under paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section, proof of 
service shall include the names of any person served and the person who 
made the service. Proof of service may be made by an acknowledgment of 
service by or on behalf of the person served or a statement signed by 
the party or the party's attorney or agent containing the information 
required by this section. A statement of an attorney or agent attached 
to, or appearing in, the paper stating the date and manner of service 
will be accepted as prima facie proof of service.

patent judge shall set a time for filing motions (Sec. 1.635) for 
additional discovery under Sec. 1.687(c) and testimony periods for 
taking any necessary testimony.
    (b) Where appropriate, testimony periods will be set to permit a 
party to:
    (1) Present its case-in-chief and/or case-in-rebuttal and/or
    (2) Cross-examine an opponent's case-in-chief and/or a case-in-
rebuttal.
    (c) A party is not entitled to take testimony to present a case-in-
chief unless:

under Sec. 1.639(c);
    (2) The party alleges in its preliminary statement a date of 
invention prior to the effective filing date of the senior party;
    (3) A testimony period has been set to permit an opponent to prove a

the party has filed a preliminary statement alleging a date of invention 
prior to that date; or
    (4) A motion (Sec. 1.635) is filed showing good cause why a 
testimony period should be set.

patent judge, with or without a motion (Sec. 1.635) by another party, 
may issue an order to show cause why judgment should not be entered 
against the junior party. When an order is issued under this section, 
the Board shall enter judgment in accordance with the order unless, 
within 15 days after the date of the order, the junior party files a 
paper which shows good cause why judgment should not be entered in

Sec. 1.655  Matters considered in rendering a final decision.

    (a) In rendering a final decision, the Board may consider any 
properly raised issue, including priority of invention, derivation by an 
opponent from a party who filed a preliminary statement under 
Sec. 1.625, patentability of the invention, admissibility of evidence, 
any interlocutory matter deferred to final hearing, and any other matter 
necessary to resolve the interference. The Board may also consider 
whether an interlocutory order should be modified. The burden of showing 
that an interlocutory order should be modified shall be on the party 
attacking the order. The abuse of discretion standard shall apply only 
to procedural matters.
    (b) A party shall not be entitled to raise for consideration at 
final hearing any matter which properly could have been raised by a 
motion under Sec. 1.633 or 1.634 unless the matter was properly raised 
in a motion that was timely filed by the party under Sec. 1.633 or 1.634 
and the motion was denied or deferred to final hearing, the matter was 
properly raised by the party in a timely filed opposition to a motion 
under Sec. 1.633 or 1.634 and the motion was granted over the opposition 
or deferred to final hearing, or the party shows good cause why the 
issue was not properly raised by a timely filed motion or

[[Page 163]]

opposition. A party that fails to contest, by way of a timely filed 
preliminary motion under Sec. 1.633(c), the designation of a claim as 
corresponding to a count, or fails to timely argue the separate 
patentability of a particular claim when the ground for unpatentability 
is first raised, may not subsequently argue to an administrative patent 
judge or the Board the separate patentability of claims designated to 
correspond to the count with respect to that ground.
    (c) In the interest of justice, the Board may exercise its 
discretion to consider an issue even though it would not otherwise be 
entitled to consideration under this section.

appropriate headings and in the order indicated:
    (1) A statement of interest indicating the full name of every party 
represented by the attorney in the interference and the name of the real 
party in interest if the party named in the caption is not the real 
party in interest.
    (2) A statement of related cases indicating whether the interference 
was previously before the Board for final hearing and the name and 
number of any related appeal or interference which is pending before, or 
which has been decided by, the Board, or which is pending before, or 
which has been decided by, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit or a district court in a proceeding under 35 U.S.C. 146. A 
related appeal or interference is one which will directly affect or be 
directly affected by or have a bearing on the Board's decision in the 
pending interference.
    (3) A table of contents, with page references, and a table of cases 
(alphabetically arranged), statutes, and other authorities cited, with 
references to the pages of the brief where they are cited.
    (4) A statement of the issues presented for decision in the 
interference.
    (5) A statement of the facts, in numbered paragraphs, relevant to 
the issues presented for decision with appropriate references to the 
record.
    (6) An argument, which may be preceded by a summary, which shall 
contain the contentions of the party with respect to the issues it is 
raising for consideration at final hearing, and the reasons therefor, 
with citations to the cases, statutes, other authorities, and parts of 
the record relied on.
    (7) A short conclusion stating the precise relief requested.
    (8) An appendix containing a copy of the counts.
    (c) The opening brief of the senior party shall conform to the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section except:
    (1) A statement of the issues and of the facts need not be made 
unless the party is dissatisfied with the statement in the opening brief 
of the junior party and
    (2) An appendix containing a copy of the counts need not be included 
if the copy of the counts in the opening brief of the junior party is 
correct.
    (d) Unless ordered otherwise by an administrative patent judge, 
briefs shall be double-spaced (except for footnotes, which may be 
single-spaced) and shall comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.653(g) 
for records except the requirement for binding.
    (e) An original and four copies of each brief must be filed.
    (f) Any brief which does not comply with the requirements of this 
section may be returned under Sec. 1.618(a).
    (g) Any party, separate from its opening brief, but filed 
concurrently therewith, may file an original and four copies of concise 
proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Any proposed findings 
of fact shall be in numbered paragraphs and shall be supported by 
specific references to the record. Any proposed conclusions of law shall

fact or conclusions of law; when objecting, a reason must be given. The 
Board may adopt the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in 
whole or in part.
    (h) If a party wants the Board in rendering its final decision to 
rule on the admissibility of any evidence, the party shall file with its 
opening brief an original and four copies of a motion (Sec. 1.635) to 
suppress the evidence. The provisions of Sec. 1.637(b) do not apply to a 
motion to suppress under this paragraph. Any objection previously made 
to the admissibility of the evidence of an opponent is waived unless the 
motion required by this paragraph is filed. A party that failed to 
challenge the admissibility of the evidence of an opponent on a ground 
that could have been raised in a timely objection under Sec. 1.672(c), 
1.682(c), 1.683(b) or 1.688(b) may not move under this paragraph to 
suppress the evidence on that ground at final hearing. An original and 
four copies of an opposition to the motion may be filed with an 
opponent's opening brief or reply brief as may be appropriate.
    (i) When a junior party fails to timely file an opening brief, an 
order may issue requiring the junior party to show cause why the Board 
should not treat failure to file the brief as a concession of priority. 
If the junior party fails to show good cause within a time period set in 
the order, judgment may be entered against the junior party.

Sec. 1.657  Burden of proof as to date of invention.

    (a) A rebuttable presumption shall exist that, as to each count, the 
inventors made their invention in the chronological order of their 
effective filing dates. The burden of proof shall be upon a party who 
contends otherwise.
    (b) In an interference involving copending applications or involving 
a patent and an application having an effective filing date on or before 
the date the patent issued, a junior party shall have the burden of 
establishing priority by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (c) In an interference involving an application and a patent and 
where the effective filing date of the application is after the date the 
patent issued, a junior party shall have the burden of establishing 
priority by clear and convincing evidence.

[60 FR 14530, Mar. 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.658  Final decision.

    (a) After final hearing, the Board shall enter a decision resolving 
the issues raised at final hearing. The decision may enter judgment, in 
whole or in part, remand the interference to an administrative patent 
judge for further proceedings, or take further action not inconsistent 
with law. A judgment as to a count shall state whether or not each party 
is entitled to a patent containing the claims in the party's patent or 
application which correspond to the count. When the Board enters a 
decision awarding judgment as to all counts, the decision shall be 
regarded as a final decision for the purpose of judicial review (35 
U.S.C. 141-144, 146) unless a request for reconsideration under 
paragraph (b) of this section is timely filed.
    (b) Any request for reconsideration of a decision under paragraph 
(a) of this section shall be filed within one month after the date of 
the decision. The request for reconsideration shall specify with 
particularity the points believed to have been misapprehended or 
overlooked in rendering the decision. Any opposition to a request for 
reconsideration shall be filed within 14 days of the date of service of 
the request for reconsideration. Service of the request for 
reconsideration shall be by hand or Express Mail. The Board shall enter 
a decision on the request for reconsideration. If the Board shall be of 
the opinion that the decision on the request for reconsideration 
significantly modifies its original decision under paragraph (a) of this 
section, the Board may designate the decision on the request for 
reconsideration as a new decision. A decision on reconsideration is a 
final decision for the purpose of judicial review (35 U.S.C. 141-144, 
146).
    (c) A judgment in an interference settles all issues which (1) were 
raised and decided in the interference, (2) could have been properly 
raised and decided in the interference by a motion under Sec. 1.633 (a) 
through (d) and (f) through (j)

[[Page 165]]

or Sec. 1.634, and (3) could have been properly raised and decided in an 
additional interference with a motion under Sec. 1.633(e). A losing 
party who could have properly moved, but failed to move, under 
Sec. 1.633 or 1.634, shall be estopped to take ex parte or inter partes 
action in the Patent and Trademark Office after the interference which 
is inconsistent with that party's failure to properly move, except that 
a losing party shall not be estopped with respect to any claims which 
correspond, or properly could have corresponded, to a count as to which 
that party was awarded a favorable judgment.

<R05>
Sec. 1.659  Recommendation.

    (a) Should the Board have knowledge of any ground for rejecting any 
application claim not involved in the judgment of the interference, it 
may include in its decision a recommended rejection of the claim. Upon 
resumption of ex parte prosecution of the application, the examiner 
shall be bound by the recommendation and shall enter and maintain the 
recommended rejection unless an amendment or showing of facts not 
previously of record is filed which, in the opinion of the examiner, 
overcomes the recommended rejection.
    (b) Should the Board have knowledge of any ground for reexamination 
of a patent involved in the interference as to a patent claim not 
involved in the judgment of the interference, it may include in its 
decision a recommendation to the Commissioner that the patent be 
reexamined. The Commissioner will determine whether reexamination will 
be ordered.
    (c) The Board may make any other recommendation to the examiner or 
the Commissioner as may be appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 1.660  Notice of reexamination, reissue, protest, or litigation.

    (a) When a request for reexamination of a patent involved in an 
interference is filed, the patent owner shall notify the Board within 10 
days of receiving notice that the request was filed.
    (b) When an application for reissue is filed by a patentee involved 
in an interference, the patentee shall notify the Board within 10 days 
of the day the application for reissue is filed.
    (c) When a protest under Sec. 1.291 is filed against an application 
involved in an interference, the applicant shall notify the Board within 
10 days of receiving notice that the protest was filed.
    (d) A party in an interference shall notify the Board promptly of 
any litigation related to any patent or application involved in an 
interference, including any civil action commenced under 35 U.S.C. 146.
    (e) The notice required by this section is designed to assist the 
administrative patent judge and the Board in efficiently handling 
interference cases. Failure of a party to comply with the provisions of 
this section may result in sanctions under Sec. 1.616. Knowledge by, or 
notice to, an employee of the Office other than an employee of the 
Board, of the existence of the reexamination, application for reissue, 
protest, or litigation shall not be sufficient. The notice contemplated 
by this section is notice addressed to the administrative patent judge 
in charge of the interference in which the application or patent is 
involved.

<R05>
Sec. 1.661  Termination of interference after judgment.

    After a final decision is entered by the Board, an interference is 
considered terminated when no appeal (35 U.S.C. 141) or other review (35 
U.S.C. 146) has been or can be taken or had.


<R05>
Sec. 1.662  Request for entry of adverse judgment; reissue filed by patentee.

    (a) A party may, at any time during an interference, request and 
agree to entry of an adverse judgment. The filing by a party of a 
written disclaimer of the invention defined by a count, concession of 
priority or unpatentability of the subject matter of a count, 
abandonment of the invention defined by a count, or abandonment of the 
contest as to a count will be treated as a request for entry of an 
adverse judgment against the applicant or patentee as to all claims 
which correspond to the count. Abandonment of

[[Page 166]]

an application, other than an application for reissue having a claim of 
the patent sought to be reissued involved in the interference, will be 
treated as a request for entry of an adverse judgment against the 
applicant as to all claims corresponding to all counts. Upon the filing 
by a party of a request for entry of an adverse judgment, the Board may 
enter judgment against the party.
    (b) If a patentee involved in an interference files an application 
for reissue during the interference and the reissue application does not 
include a claim that corresponds to a count, judgment may be entered 
against the patentee. A patentee who files an application for reissue 
which includes a claim that corresponds to a count shall, in addition to 
complying with the provisions of Sec. 1.660(b), timely file a 
preliminary motion under Sec. 1.633(h) or show good cause why the motion 
could not have been timely filed or would not be appropriate.
    (c) The filing of a statutory disclaimer under 35 U.S.C. 253 by a 
patentee will delete any statutorily disclaimed claims from being 
involved in the interference. A statutory disclaimer will not be treated 
as a request for entry of an adverse judgment against the patentee 
unless it results in the deletion of all patent claims corresponding to 
a count.

<R05>
Sec. 1.663  Status of claim of defeated applicant after interference.

    Whenever an adverse judgment is entered as to a count against an 
applicant from which no appeal (35 U.S.C. 141) or other review (35 
U.S.C. 146) has been or can be taken or had, the claims of the 
application corresponding to the count stand finally disposed of without 
further action by the examiner. Such claims are not open to further ex 
parte prosecution.


<R05>
Sec. 1.664  Action after interference.

    (a) After termination of an interference, the examiner will promptly 
take such action in any application previously involved in the 
interference as may be necessary. Unless entered by order of an 
administrative patent judge, amendments presented during the 
interference shall not be entered, but may be subsequently presented by 
the applicant subject to the provisions of this subpart provided 
prosecution of the application is not otherwise closed.
    (b) After judgment, the application of any party may be held subject 
to further examination, including an interference with another 
application.

[60 FR 14530, Mar. 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.665  Second interference.

    A second interference between the same parties will not be declared 
upon an application not involved in an earlier interference for an 
invention defined by a count of the earlier interference. See 
Sec. 1.658(c).


<R05>
Sec. 1.666  Filing of interference settlement agreements.

    (a) Any agreement or understanding between parties to an 
interference, including any collateral agreements referred to therein, 
made in connection with or in contemplation of the termination of the 
interference, must be in writing and a true copy thereof must be filed 
before the termination of the interference (Sec. 1.661) as between the 
parties to the agreement or understanding.
    (b) If any party filing the agreement or understanding under 
paragraph (a) of this section so requests, the copy will be kept 
separate from the file of the interference, and made available only to 
Government agencies on written request, or to any person upon petition 
accompanied by the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(h) and on a showing of 
good cause.
    (c) Failure to file the copy of the agreement or understanding under 
paragraph (a) of this section will render permanently unenforceable such 
agreement or understanding and any patent of the parties involved in the 
interference or any patent subsequently issued on any application of the 
parties so involved. The Commissioner may, however, upon petition 
accompanied by the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(h) and on a showing of 
good cause for failure to file within the time prescribed, permit the 
filing of the agreement or understanding during the six month period

[[Page 167]]

subsequent to the termination of the interference as between the parties 
to the agreement or understanding.

<R05>
Sec. 1.671  Evidence must comply with rules.

    (a) Evidence consists of affidavits, transcripts of depositions, 
documents and things.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the Federal Rules 
of Evidence shall apply to interference proceedings. Those portions of 
the Federal Rules of Evidence relating to criminal actions, juries, and 
other matters not relevant to interferences shall not apply.
    (c) Unless the context is otherwise clear, the following terms of 
the Federal Rules of Evidence shall be construed as follows:
    (1) Courts of the United States, U.S. Magistrate, court, trial 
court, or trier of fact means administrative patent judge or Board as 
may be appropriate.
    (2) Judge means administrative patent judge.
    (3) Judicial notice means official notice.
    (4) Civil action, civil proceeding, action, or trial, mean 
interference.

    (6) Before the hearing in Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence 
means before giving testimony by affidavit or oral deposition.
    (7) The trial or hearing in Rules 803(24) and 804(5) of the Federal 
Rules of Evidence means the taking of testimony by affidavit or oral 
deposition.
    (d) Certification is not necessary as a condition to admissibility 
when the record is a record of the Patent and Trademark Office to which 
all parties have access.
    (e) A party may not rely on an affidavit (including exhibits), 
patent, or printed publication previously submitted by the party under 
Sec. 1.639(b) unless a copy of the affidavit, patent, or printed 
publication has been served and a written notice is filed prior to the 
close of the party's relevant testimony period stating that the party 
intends to rely on the affidavit, patent, or printed publication. When 
proper notice is given under this paragraph, the affidavit, patent, or 
printed publication shall be deemed as filed under Sec. 1.640(b), 
Sec. 1.640(e)(3), or Sec. 1.672, as appropriate.
    (f) The significance of documentary and other exhibits identified by 
a witness in an affidavit or during oral deposition shall be discussed 
with particularity by a witness.
    (g) A party must file a motion (Sec. 1.635) seeking permission from 
an administrative patent judge prior to compelling testimony or 
production of documents or things under 35 U.S.C. 24 or from an opposing 
party. The motion shall describe the general nature and the relevance of 
the testimony, document, or thing. If permission is granted, the party 
shall notice a deposition under Sec. 1.673 and may proceed to take 
testimony.
    (h) A party must file a motion (Sec. 1.635) seeking permission from 
an administrative patent judge prior to compelling testimony or 
production of documents or things in a foreign country.
    (1) In the case of testimony, the motion shall:
    (i) Describe the general nature and relevance of the testimony;
    (ii) Identify the witness by name or title;
    (iii) Identify the foreign country and explain why the party 
believes the witness can be compelled to testify in the foreign country, 
including a description of the procedures that will be used to compel 
the testimony in the foreign country and an estimate of the time it is 
expected to take to obtain the testimony; and
    (iv) Demonstrate that the party has made reasonable efforts to 
secure the agreement of the witness to testify in the United States but 
has been unsuccessful in obtaining the agreement, even though the party 
has offered to pay the expenses of the witness to travel to and testify 
in the United States.
    (2) In the case of production of a document or thing, the motion 
shall:
    (i) Describe the general nature and relevance of the document or 
thing;

[[Page 168]]

    (ii) Identify the foreign country and explain why the party believes 
production of the document or thing can be compelled in the foreign

obtain the agreement of the individual or entity having possession, 
custody, or control of the document to produce the document or thing in 
the United States but has been unsuccessful in obtaining that agreement, 
even though the party has offered to pay the expenses of producing the 
document or thing in the United States.
    (i) Evidence which is not taken or sought and filed in accordance 
with this subpart shall not be admissible.
    (j) The weight to be given deposition testimony taken in a foreign 
country will be determined in view of all the circumstances, including 
the laws of the foreign country governing the testimony. Little, if any, 
weight may be given to deposition testimony taken in a foreign country 
unless the party taking the testimony proves by clear and convincing 
evidence, as a matter of fact, that knowingly giving false testimony in 
that country in connection with an interference proceeding in the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office is punishable under the laws of that 
country and that the punishment in that country for such false testimony 
is comparable to or greater than the punishment for perjury committed in 
the United States. The administrative patent judge and the Board, in 
determining foreign law, may consider any relevant material or source, 
including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible 
under the Federal Rules of Evidence.

<R05>
Sec. 1.672  Manner of taking testimony.

    (a) Unless testimony must be compelled under 35 U.S.C. 24, compelled 
from a party, or compelled in a foreign country, testimony of a witness 
shall be taken by affidavit in accordance with this subpart. Testimony 
which must be compelled under 35 U.S.C. 24, compelled from a party, or 
compelled in a foreign country shall be taken by oral deposition.
    (b) A party presenting testimony of a witness by affidavit shall, 
within the time set by the administrative patent judge for serving 
affidavits, file a copy of the affidavit or, if appropriate, notice 
under Sec. 1.671(e). If the affidavit relates to a party's case-in-
chief, it shall be filed or noticed no later than the date set by an 
administrative patent judge for the party to file affidavits for its 
case-in-chief. If the affidavit relates to a party's case-in-rebuttal, 
it shall be filed or noticed no later than the date set by an 
administrative patent judge for the party to file affidavits for its 
case-in-rebuttal. A party shall not be entitled to rely on any document 
referred to in the affidavit unless a copy of the document is filed with 
the affidavit. A party shall not be entitled to rely on any thing 
mentioned in the affidavit unless the opponent is given reasonable 
access to the thing. A thing is something other than a document. The 
pages of affidavits filed under this paragraph and of any other 
testimony filed therewith under Secs. 1.683(a) and 1.688(a) shall, to 
the extent possible, be given sequential numbers which shall also serve 
as the record page numbers for the affidavits and other testimony in the 
party's record to be filed under Sec. 1.653. Exhibits identified in the 
affidavits or in any other testimony filed under Secs. 1.683(a) and 
1.688(a) and any official records and printed publications filed under 
Sec. 1.682(a) shall, to the extent possible, be given sequential exhibit 
numbers, which shall also serve as the exhibit numbers when the exhibits 
are filed with the party's record. The affidavits, testimony filed under 
Secs. 1.683(a) and 1.688(a) and exhibits shall be accompanied by an 
index of the names of the witnesses, giving the number of the page where 
the testimony of each witness begins, and by an index of the exhibits 
briefly describing the nature of each exhibit and giving the number of 
the page where each exhibit is first identified and offered into 
evidence.

[[Page 169]]

    (c) If an opponent objects to the admissibility of any evidence 
contained in or submitted with an affidavit filed under paragraph (b) of 
this section, the opponent must, no later than the date set by the 
administrative patent judge for filing objections under this paragraph, 
file objections stating with particularity the nature of each objection. 
An opponent that fails to object to the admissibility of the evidence 
contained in or submitted with an affidavit on a ground that could have 
been raised in a timely objection under this paragraph will not be 
entitled to move under Sec. 1.656(h) to suppress the evidence on that 
ground. If an opponent timely files objections, the party may, within 20 
days of the due date for filing objections, file one or more 
supplemental affidavits, official records or printed publications to 
overcome the objections. No objection to the admissibility of the 
supplemental evidence shall be made, except as provided by 
Sec. 1.656(h). The pages of supplemental affidavits filed under this 
paragraph shall, to the extent possible, be sequentially numbered 
beginning with the number following the last page number of the party's 
testimony submitted under paragraph (b) of this section. The page 
numbers assigned to the supplemental affidavits shall also serve as the 
record page numbers for the supplemental affidavits in the party's 
record filed under Sec. 1.653. Additional exhibits identified in 
supplemental affidavits and any supplemental official records and 
printed publications shall, to the extent possible, be given sequential 
numbers beginning with the number following the last number of the 
exhibits submitted under paragraph (b) of this section. The exhibit 
numbers shall also serve as the exhibit numbers when the exhibits are 
filed with the party's record. The supplemental affidavits shall be 
accompanied by an index of the names of the witnesses and an index of 
exhibits of the type specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) After the time expires for filing objections and supplemental 
affidavits, or earlier when appropriate, the administrative patent judge 
shall set a time within which any opponent may file a request to cross-
examine an affiant on oral deposition. If any opponents requests cross-
examination of an affiant, the party shall notice a deposition at a 
reasonable location within the United States under Sec. 1.673(e) for the 
purpose of cross-examination by any opponent. Any redirect and recross 
shall take place at the deposition. At any deposition for the purpose of 
cross-examination of a witness, the party shall not be entitled to rely 
on any document or thing not mentioned in one or more of the affidavits 
filed under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, except to the extent 
necessary to conduct proper redirect. The party who gives notice of a 
deposition shall be responsible for providing a translator if the 
witness does not testify in English, for obtaining a court reporter, and 
for filing a certified transcript of the deposition as required by 
Sec. 1.676. Within 45 days of the close of the period for taking cross-
examination, the party shall serve (but not file) a copy of each 
transcript on each opponent together with copies of any additional 
documentary exhibits identified by the witness during the deposition. 
The pages of the transcripts served under this paragraph shall, to the 
extent possible, be sequentially numbered beginning with the number 
following the last page number of the party's supplemental affidavits 
submitted under paragraph (c) of this section. The numbers assigned to 
the transcript pages shall also serve as the record page numbers for the 
transcripts in the party's record filed under Sec. 1.653. Additional 
exhibits identified in the transcripts, shall, to the extent possible, 
be given sequential numbers beginning with the number following the last 
number of the exhibits submitted under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section. The exhibit numbers assigned to the additional exhibits shall 
also serve as the exhibit numbers when those exhibits are filed with the 
party's record. The deposition transcripts shall be accompanied by an 
index of the names of the witnesses, giving the number of the page where 
cross-examination, redirect and recross of each witness begins, and an 
index of exhibits of the type specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) When a deposition is authorized to be taken within the United 
States under this subpart and if the parties

[[Page 170]]

agree in writing, the deposition may be taken in any place within the 
United States, before any person authorized to administer oaths, upon 
any notice, and in any manner, and when so taken may be used like other 
depositions.
    (g) If the parties agree in writing, the affidavit testimony of any 
witness may be submitted without opportunity for cross-examination.
    (h) If the parties agree in writing, testimony may be submitted in 
the form of an agreed statement setting forth how a particular witness 
would testify, if called, or the facts in the case of one or more of the 
parties. The agreed statement shall be filed in the Patent and Trademark 
Office. See Sec. 1.653(a).
    (i) In an unusual circumstance and upon a showing that testimony 
cannot be taken in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, an 
administrative patent judge upon motion (Sec. 1.635) may authorize 
testimony to be taken in another manner.

[60 FR 14531, Mar. 17, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.673  Notice of examination of witness.

    (a) A party authorized to take testimony of a witness by deposition 
shall, after complying with paragraphs (b) and (g) of this section, file 
and serve a single notice of deposition stating the time and place of 
each deposition to be taken. Depositions to be taken in the United 
States may be noticed for a reasonable time and place in the United 
States. A deposition may not be noticed for any other place without 
approval of an administrative patent judge. The notice shall specify the 
name and address of each witness and the general nature of the testimony 
to be given by the witness. If the name of a witness is not known, a 
general description sufficient to identify the witness or a particular 
class or group to which the witness belongs may be given instead.
    (b) Unless the parties agree or an administrative patent judge or 
the Board determine otherwise, a party shall serve, but not file, at 
least three working days prior to the conference required by paragraph 
(g) of this section, if service is made by hand or Express Mail, or at 
least 14 days prior to the conference if service is made by any other 
means, the following:
    (1) A list and copy of each document in the party's possession, 
custody, or control and upon which the party intends to rely at any 
deposition and
    (2) A list of and a proffer of reasonable access to things in the 
party's possession, custody, or control and upon which the party intends 
to rely at any deposition.
    (c) A party shall not be permitted to rely on any witness not listed 
in the notice, or any document not served or any thing not listed as 
required by paragraph (b) of this section:
    (1) Unless all opponents agree in writing or on the record to permit 
the party to rely on the witness, document or thing, or
    (2) Except upon a motion (Sec. 1.635) promptly filed which is 
accompanied by any proposed notice, additional documents, or lists and 
which shows good cause why the notice, documents, or lists were not 
served in accordance with this section.
    (d) Each opponent shall have a full opportunity to attend a 
deposition and cross-examine.
    (e) A party who has presented testimony by affidavit and is required 
to notice depositions for the purpose of cross-examination under 
Sec. 1.672(b), shall, after complying with paragraph (g) of this 
section, file and serve a single notice of deposition stating the time 
and place of each cross-examination deposition to be taken.
    (f) The parties shall not take depositions in more than one place at 
the same time or so nearly at the same time that reasonable opportunity

Interferences or by a Federal court under 35 U.S.C. 141 or 145, if the 
patent was issued pursuant to a decision reversing an adverse 
determination of patentability and if the patent is not subject to a 
terminal disclaimer due to the issuance of another patent claiming 
subject matter that is not patentably distinct from that under appellate 
review.
    (b) The term of a patent entitled to extension under paragraph (a) 
of this section shall be extended for the sum of the periods of delay 
calculated under paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3) and (d) of this 
section, to the extent that these periods are not overlapping, up to a 
maximum of five years. The extension will run from the expiration date 
of the patent.
    (c)(1) The period of delay under paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
for an application is the sum of the following periods, to the extent 
that the periods are not overlapping:
    (i) With respect to each interference in which the application was 
involved, the number of days, if any, in the period beginning on the 
date the interference was declared or redeclared to involve the 
application in the interference and ending on the date that the 
interference was terminated with respect to the application; and
    (ii) The number of days, if any, in the period beginning on the date 
prosecution in the application was suspended by the Patent and Trademark 
Office due to interference proceedings under 35 U.S.C. 135(a) not 
involving the application and ending on the date of the termination of 
the suspension.
    (2) The period of delay under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for 
an application is the sum of the following periods, to the extent that 
the periods are not overlapping:

under secrecy order and ending on the date the secrecy order and any 
renewal thereof was removed;

date applicant was notified that an interference would be declared but 
for the secrecy order and ending on the date the secrecy order and any 
renewal thereof was removed; and

the sum of the number of days, if any, in the period beginning on the 
date on which an appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences 
was filed under 35 U.S.C. 134 and ending on the date of a final decision 
in favor of the applicant by the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences or by a Federal court in an appeal under 35 U.S.C. 141 or

before

[[Page 175]]

three years from the filing date of the first national application for 
patent presented for examination; and
    (2) Any time during the period of appellate review, as determined by 
the Commissioner, during which the applicant for patent did not act with 
due diligence. In determining the due diligence of an applicant, the 
Commissioner may examine the facts and circumstances of the applicant's 
actions during the period of appellate review to determine whether the 
applicant exhibited that degree of timeliness as may reasonably be 
expected from, and which is ordinarily exercised by, a person during a 
period of appellate review.
    (e) The provisions of this section apply only to original patents, 
except for design patents, issued on applications filed on or after June 
8, 1995, and before May 29, 2000.

    (a) Failure to take certain actions within specified time frames. 
Subject to the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 154(b) and this subpart, the term 
of an original patent shall be adjusted if the issuance of the patent 
was delayed due to the failure of the Office to:

or fulfilled the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 371 in an international 
application;
    (2) Respond to a reply under 35 U.S.C. 132 or to an appeal taken

    (3) Act on an application not later than four months after the date 
of a decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences under 35

145, or 146 where at least one allowable claim remains in the 
application; or
    (4) Issue a patent not later than four months after the date on 
which the issue fee was paid under 35 U.S.C. 151 and all outstanding 
requirements were satisfied.

filing date of the application. Subject to the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 
154(b) and this subpart, the term of an original patent shall be 
adjusted if the issuance of the patent was delayed due to the failure of 
the Office to issue a patent within three years after the date on which 
the application was filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) or the national stage 
commenced under 35 U.S.C. 371(b) or (f) in an international application, 
but not including:
    (1) Any time consumed by continued examination of the application 
under 35 U.S.C. 132(b);
    (2) Any time consumed by an interference proceeding under 35 U.S.C. 
135(a);

that was requested by the applicant.

provisions of 35 U.S.C. 154(b) and this subpart, the term of an original 
patent shall be adjusted if the issuance of the patent was delayed due 
to interference proceedings under 35 U.S.C. 135(a).
    (d) Delays caused by secrecy order. Subject to the provisions of 35 
U.S.C. 154(b) and this subpart, the term of an original patent shall be 
adjusted if the issuance of the patent was delayed due to the 
application being placed under a secrecy order under 35 U.S.C. 181.
    (e) Delays caused by successful appellate review. Subject to the 
provisions of 35 U.S.C. 154(b) and this subpart, the term of an original 
patent shall be adjusted if the issuance of the patent was delayed due 
to review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences under 35 
U.S.C. 134 or by a Federal court under 35 U.S.C. 141 or 145, if the 
patent was issued pursuant to a decision reversing an adverse 
determination of patentability.

apply only to original applications, except applications for a design 
patent, filed on or after May 29, 2000, and patents issued on such 
applications.

Sec. 1.750  Determination of eligibility for extension of patent term.

    A determination as to whether a patent is eligible for extension may 
be made by the Commissioner solely on the basis of the representations 
contained in the application for extension filed in compliance with 
Sec. 1.740 or Sec. 1.790. This determination may be delegated to 
appropriate Patent and Trademark Office officials and may be made at any 
time before the certificate of extension is issued. The Commissioner or 
other appropriate officials may require from applicant further 
information or make such independent inquiries as desired before a final 
determination is made on whether a patent is eligible for extension. In 
an application for extension filed in compliance with Sec. 1.740, a 
notice will be mailed to applicant containing the determination as to 
the eligibility of the patent for extension and the period of time of 
the extension, if any. This notice shall constitute the final 
determination as to the eligibility and any period of extension of the 
patent. A single request for reconsideration of a final determination 
may be made if filed by the applicant within such time as may be set in 
the notice of final determination or, if no time is set, within one 
month from the date of the final determination. The time periods set 
forth herein are subject to the provisions of Sec. 1.136.

Sec. 1.760  Interim extension of patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156(e)(2).

    An applicant who has filed a formal application for extension in 
compliance with Sec. 1.740 may request one or more interim extensions 
for periods of up to one year each pending a final determination on the 
application pursuant to Sec. 1.750. Any such request should be filed at 
least three months prior to the expiration date of the patent. The 
Commissioner may issue interim extensions, without a request by the 
applicant, for periods of up to one year each until a final 
determination is made. The patent owner or agent will be notified when 
an interim extension is granted and notice of the extension will be 
published in the Official Gazette of the United States Patent and 
Trademark Office. The notice will be recorded in the official file of 
the patent and will be considered as part of the original patent. In no 
event will the interim extensions granted under this section be longer 
than the maximum period for extension to which the applicant would be 
eligible.

Sec. 1.765  Duty of disclosure in patent term extension proceedings.

    (a) A duty of candor and good faith toward the Patent and Trademark 
Office and the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary 
of Agriculture rests on the patent owner or its agent, on each attorney 
or agent who represents the patent owner and on every other individual 
who is substantively involved on behalf of the patent owner in a patent 
term extension proceeding. All such individuals who are aware, or become 
aware, of material information adverse to a determination of entitlement 
to the extension sought, which has not been previously made of record in 
the patent term extension proceeding must bring such information to the 
attention of the Office or the Secretary, as appropriate, in accordance 
with paragraph (b) of this section, as soon as it is practical to do so 
after the individual becomes aware of the information. Information is 
material where there is a substantial likelihood that the Office or the 
Secretary would consider it important in determinations to be made in 
the patent term extension proceeding.
    (b) Disclosures pursuant to this section must be accompanied by a 
copy of each written document which is being disclosed. The disclosure 
must be made to the Office or the Secretary, as appropriate, unless the 
disclosure is material to determinations to be made by both the Office 
and the Secretary, in which case duplicate copies, certified as such, 
must be filed in the Office and with the Secretary. Disclosures pursuant 
to this section may be made to the Office or the Secretary, as 
appropriate, through an attorney or agent having responsibility on 
behalf of the patent owner or its agent for the patent term extension 
proceeding or through a patent owner acting on his or her own behalf. 
Disclosure to such an attorney, agent or patent owner shall satisfy the 
duty of any other individual. Such an attorney, agent or patent owner 
has no duty to transmit information which is not material to the 
determination of entitlement to the extension sought.
    (c) No patent will be determined eligible for extension and no 
extension will be issued if it is determined that fraud on the Office or 
the Secretary was practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was 
violated through bad faith or gross negligence in connection with the 
patent term extension proceeding. If it is established by clear and 
convincing evidence that any fraud was practiced or attempted on the 
Office or the Secretary in connection with the patent term extension 
proceeding or that there was any violation of the duty of disclosure 
through bad faith or gross negligence in connection with the patent term 
extension proceeding, a final determination will be made pursuant to 
Sec. 1.750 that the patent is not eligible for extension.
    (d) The duty of disclosure pursuant to this section rests on the 
individuals identified in paragraph (a) of this section and no 
submission on behalf of third parties, in the form of protests or 
otherwise, will be considered by the Office. Any such submissions by 
third parties to the Office will be returned to the party making the 
submission, or otherwise disposed of, without consideration by the 
Office.

Sec. 1.770  Express withdrawal of application for extension of patent term.

    An application for extension of patent term may be expressly 
withdrawn before a determination is made pursuant to Sec. 1.750 by 
filing in the Office, in duplicate, a written declaration of withdrawal 
signed by the owner of record of the patent or its agent. An application 
may not be expressly withdrawn after the date permitted for reply to the 
final determination on the application. An express withdrawal pursuant 
to this section is effective when acknowledged in writing by the Office. 
The filing of an express withdrawal pursuant to this section and its 
acceptance by the Office does not entitle applicant to a refund of the 
filing fee (Sec. 1.20(j)) or any portion thereof.

156(d)(2)(B) by the Secretary of Agriculture that applicant did not act 
with due diligence;
    (iii) One-half the number of days remaining in the period defined by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section after that period is reduced in 
accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section; half 
days will be ignored for purposes of subtraction;
    (2) By adding the number of days determined in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section to the original term of the patent as shortened by any 
terminal disclaimer;
    (3) By adding 14 years to the date of the issuance of a license 
under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act;
    (4) By comparing the dates for the ends of the periods obtained 
pursuant to paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section with each other 
and selecting the earlier date;
    (5) If the original patent was issued after November 16, 1988, by--

Sec. 1.780  Certificate or order of extension of patent term.

    If a determination is made pursuant to Sec. 1.750 that a patent is 
eligible for extension and that the term of the patent is to be 
extended, a certificate of extension, under seal, or an order granting 
interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5), will be issued to the 
applicant for the extension of the patent term. Such certificate or 
order will be recorded in the official file of the patent and will be 
considered as part of the original patent. Notification of the issuance 
of the certificate or order of extension will be published in the 
Official Gazette of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 
Notification of the issuance of the order granting an interim extension 
under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5), including the identity of the product 
currently under regulatory review, will be published in the Official 
Gazette of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in the 
Federal Register. No certificate of, or order granting, an extension 
will be issued if the term of the patent cannot be extended, even though 
the patent is otherwise determined to be eligible for extension. In such 
situations, the final determination made pursuant to Sec. 1.750 will 
indicate that no certificate or order will issue.

<R05>
Sec. 1.785  Multiple applications for extension of term of the same patent or of different patents for the same regulatory review period for a product.

    (a) Only one patent may be extended for a regulatory review period 
for any product (Sec. 1.720(h)). If more than one application for 
extension of the same patent is filed, the certificate of extension of 
patent term, if appropriate, will be issued based upon the first filed 
application for extension.

[[Page 192]]

    (b) If more than one application for extension is filed by a single 
applicant which seeks the extension of the term of two or more patents 
based upon the same regulatory review period, and the patents are 
otherwise eligible for extension pursuant to the requirements of this 
subpart, in the absence of an election by the applicant, the certificate 
of extension of patent term, if appropriate, will be issued upon the 
application for extension of the patent term having the earliest date of 
issuance of those patents for which extension is sought.
    (c) If an application for extension is filed which seeks the 
extension of the term of a patent based upon the same regulatory review 
period as that relied upon in one or more applications for extension 
pursuant to the requirements of this subpart, the certificate of 
extension of patent term will be issued on the application only if the 
patent owner or its agent is the holder of the regulatory approval 
granted with respect to the regulatory review period.
    (d) An application for extension shall be considered complete and 
formal regardless of whether it contains the identification of the 
holder of the regulatory approval granted with respect to the regulatory 
review period. When an application contains such information, or is 
amended to contain such information, it will be considered in 
determining whether an application is eligible for an extension under 
this section. A request may be made of any applicant to supply such 
information within a non-extendable period of not less than one month 
whenever multiple applications for extension of more than one patent are 
received and rely upon the same regulatory review period. Failure to 
provide such information within the period for reply set shall be 
regarded as conclusively establishing that the applicant is not the 
holder of the regulatory approval.
    (e) Determinations made under this section shall be included in the 
notice of final determination of eligibility for extension of the patent 
term pursuant to Sec. 1.750 and shall be regarded as part of that 
determination.

Sec. 1.790  Interim extension of patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5).

    (a) An owner of record of a patent or its agent who reasonably 
expects that the applicable regulatory review period described in 
paragraph (1)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(ii), (3)(B)(ii), (4)(B)(ii), or (5)(B)(ii) 
of subsection (g) that began for a product that is the subject of such 
patent may extend beyond the expiration of the patent term in effect may 
submit one or more applications for interim extensions for periods of up 
to one year each. The initial application for interim extension must be 
filed during the period beginning 6 months and ending 15 days before the 
patent term is due to expire. Each subsequent application for interim 
extension must be filed during the period beginning 60 days before and 
ending 30 days before the expiration of the preceding interim extension. 
In no event will the interim extensions granted under this section be 
longer than the maximum period of extension to which the applicant would 
be entitled under 35 U.S.C. 156(c).
    (b) A complete application for interim extension under this section 
shall include all of the information required for a formal application 
under Sec. 1.740 and a complete application under Sec. 1.741. Sections 
(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6)-(a)(17) of Sec. 1.740 and Sec. 1.741 
shall be read in the context of a product currently undergoing 
regulatory review. Sections (a)(3) and (a)(5) of Sec. 1.740 are not 
applicable to an application for interim extension under this section.
    (c) The content of each subsequent interim extension application may 
be limited to a request for a subsequent interim extension along with a 
statement that the regulatory review period has not been completed along 
with any materials or information required under Secs. 1.740 and 1.741 
that are not present in the preceding interim extension application.

date on which the product involved receives permission for commercial 
marketing or use. If within that 60-day period the patent owner or its 
agent files an application for extension under Secs. 1.740 and 1.741 
including any additional information required under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(1) 
not contained in the application for interim extension, the patent shall 
be further extended in accordance with the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 156.

             Subpart G--Biotechnology Invention Disclosures

                     Deposit of Biological Material

    Source: 54 FR 34880, Aug. 22, 1989, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1.801  Biological material.

    For the purposes of these regulations pertaining to the deposit of 
biological material for purposes of patents for inventions under 35 
U.S.C. 101, the term biological material shall include material that is 
capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly. 
Representative examples include bacteria, fungi including yeast, algae, 
protozoa, eukaryotic cells, cell lines, hybridomas, plasmids, viruses, 
plant tissue cells, lichens and seeds. Viruses, vectors, cell organelles 
and other non-living material existing in and reproducible from a living 
cell may be deposited by deposit of the host cell capable of reproducing 
the non-living material.


<R05>
Sec. 1.802  Need or opportunity to make a deposit.

    (a) Where an invention is, or relies on, a biological material, the 
disclosure may include reference to a deposit of such biological 
material.
    (b) Biological material need not be deposited unless access to such 
material is necessary for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements 
for patentability under 35 U.S.C. 112. If a deposit is necessary, it 
shall be acceptable if made in accordance with these regulations. 
Biological material need not be deposited, inter alia, if it is known 
and readily avaliable to the public or can be made or isolated without 
undue experimentation. Once deposited in a depository complying with 
these regulations, a biological material will be considered to be 
readily available even though some requirement of law or regulation of 
the United States or of the country in which the depository institution 
is located permits access to the material only under conditions imposed 
for safety, public health or similar reasons.
    (c) The reference to a biological material in a specification 
disclosure or the actual deposit of such material by an applicant or 
patent owner does not create any presumption that such material is 
necessary to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 112 or that deposit in accordance with 
these regulations is or was required.


<R05>
Sec. 1.803  Acceptable depository.

    (a) A deposit shall be recognized for the purposes of these 
regulations if made in
    (1) Any International Depositary Authority (IDA) as established 
under the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the 
Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure, or
    (2) Any other depository recognized to be suitable by the Office. 
Suitability will be determined by the Commissioner on the basis of the 
administrative and technical competence, and agreement of the depository 
to comply with the terms and conditions applicable to deposits for 
patent purposes. The Commissioner may seek the advice of impartial 
consultants on the suitability of a depository. The depository must:
    (i) Have a continuous existence;
    (ii) Exist independent of the control of the depositor;
    (iii) Possess the staff and facilities sufficient to examine the 
viability of a deposit and store the deposit in a manner which ensures 
that it is kept viable and uncontaminated;
    (iv) Provide for sufficient safety measures to minimize the risk of 
losing biological material deposited with it;
    (v) Be impartial and objective;
    (vi) Furnish samples of the deposited material in an expeditious and 
proper manner; and

[[Page 194]]

    (vii) Promptly notify depositors of its inability to furnish 
samples, and the reasons why.
    (b) A depository seeking status under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section must direct a communication to the Commissioner which shall:
    (1) Indicate the name and address of the depository to which the 
communication relates;
    (2) Contain detailed information as to the capacity of the 
depository to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, including information on its legal status, scientific standing, 
staff and facilities;
    (3) Indicate that the depository intends to be available, for the 
purposes of deposit, to any depositor under these same conditions;
    (4) Where the depository intends to accept for deposit only certain 
kinds of biological material, specify such kinds;
    (5) Indicate the amount of any fees that the depository will, upon 
acquiring the status of suitable depository under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section, charge for storage, viability statements and furnishings 
of samples of the deposit.
    (c) A depository having status under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section limited to certain kinds of biological material may extend such 
status to additional kinds of biological material by directing a 
communication to the Commissioner in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section. If a previous communication under paragraph (b) of this 
section is of record, items in common with the previous communication 
may be incorporated by reference.
    (d) Once a depository is recognized to be suitable by the 
Commissioner or has defaulted or discontinued its performance under this 
section, notice thereof will be published in the Office Gazette of the 
Patent and Trademark Office.


<R05>
Sec. 1.804  Time of making an original deposit.

    (a) Whenever a biological material is specifically identified in an 
application for patent as filed, an original deposit thereof may be made 
at any time before filing the application for patent or, subject to 
Sec. 1.809, during pendency of the application for patent.
    (b) When the original deposit is made after the effective filing 
date of an application for patent, the applicant must promptly submit a 
statement from a person in a position to corroborate the fact, stating 
that the biological material which is deposited is a biological material 
specifically identified in the application as filed.

<R05>
Sec. 1.805  Replacement or supplement of deposit.

    (a) A depositor, after receiving notice during the pendency of an 
application for patent, application for reissue patent or reexamination 
proceeding, that the depository possessing a deposit either cannot 
furnish samples thereof or can furnish samples thereof but the deposit 
has become contaminated or has lost its capability to function as 
described in the specification, shall notify the Office in writing, in 
each application for patent or patent affected. In such a case, or where 
the Office otherwise learns, during the pendency of an application for 
patent, application for reissue patent or reexamination proceeding, that 
the depository possessing a deposit either cannot furnish samples 
thereof or can furnish samples thereof but the deposit has become 
contaminated or has lost its capability to function as described in the 
specification, the need for making a replacement or supplemental deposit 
will be governed by the same considerations governing the need for 
making an original deposit under the provisions set forth in 
Sec. 1.802(b). A replacement or supplemental deposit made during the 
pendency of an application for patent shall not be accepted unless it 
meets the requirements for making an original deposit under these 
regulations, including the requirement set forth under Sec. 1.804(b). A 
replacement or supplemental deposit made in connection with a patent, 
whether or not made during the pendency of an application for reissue 
patent or a reexamination proceeding or both, shall not be accepted 
unless a certificate of correction under Sec. 1.323 is requested by the 
patent owner which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section.

[[Page 195]]

    (b) A request for certificate of correction under this section shall 
not be granted unless the certificate identifies:
    (1) The accession number for the replacement or supplemental 
deposit;
    (2) The date of the deposit; and
    (3) The name and address of the depository.
    (c) A request for a certificate of correction under this section 
shall not be granted unless the request is made promptly after the 
replacement or supplemental deposit has been made and the request:
    (1) Includes a statement of the reason for making the replacement or 
supplemental deposit;
    (2) Includes a statement from a person in a position to corroborate 
the fact, and stating that the replacement or supplemental deposit is of 
a biological material which is identical to that originally deposited;
    (3) Includes a showing that the patent owner acted diligently--
    (i) In the case of a replacement deposit, in making the deposit 
after receiving notice that samples could no longer be furnished from an 
earlier deposit; or
    (ii) In the case of a supplemental deposit, in making the deposit 
after receiving notice that the earlier deposit had become contaminated 
or had lost its capability to function as described in the 
specification;
    (4) Includes a statement that the term of the replacement or 
supplemental deposit expires no earlier than the term of the deposit 
being replaced or supplemented; and
    (5) Otherwise establishes compliance with these regulations.
    (d) A depositor's failure to replace a deposit, or in the case of a 
patent, to diligently replace a deposit and promptly thereafter request 
a certificate of correction which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section, after being notified that the depository possessing 
the deposit cannot furnish samples thereof, shall cause the application 
or patent involved to be treated in any Office proceeding as if no 
deposit were made.
    (e) In the event a deposit is replaced according to these 
regulations, the Office will apply a rebuttable presumption of identity 
between the original and the replacement deposit where a patent making 
reference to the deposit is relied upon during any Office proceeeding.
    (f) A replacement or supplement deposit made during the pendency of 
an application for patent may be made for any reason.
    (g) In no case is a replacement or supplemental deposit of a 
biological material necessary where the biological material, in 
accordance with Sec. 1.802(b), need not be deposited.
    (h) No replacement deposit of a biological material is necessary 
where a depository can furnish samples thereof but the depository for 
national security, health or environmental safety reasons is unable to 
provide samples to requesters outside of the jurisdiction where the 
depository is located.
    (i) The Office will not recognize in any Office proceeding a 
replacement deposit of a biological material made by a patent owner 
where the depository could furnish samples of the deposit being 
replaced.

<R05>
Sec. 1.806  Term of deposit.

    A deposit made before or during pendency of an application for 
patent shall be made for a term of at least thirty (30) years and at 
least five (5) years after the most recent request for the furnishing of 
a sample of the deposit was received by the depository. In any case, 
samples must be stored under agreements that would make them available 
beyond the enforceable life of the patent for which the deposit was 
made.


<R05>
Sec. 1.807  Viability of deposit.

    (a) A deposit of biological material that is capable of self-
replication either directly or indirectly must be viable at the time of 
deposit and during the term of deposit. Viability may be tested by the 
depository. The test must conclude only that the deposited material is 
capable of reproduction. No evidence is necessarily required regarding 
the ability of the deposited material to perform any function described 
in the patent application.

[[Page 196]]

    (b) A viability statement for each deposit of a biological material 
defined in paragraph (a) of this section not made under the Budapest 
Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms 
for the Purposes of Patent Procedure must be filed in the application 
and must contain:
    (1) The name and address of the depository;
    (2) The name and address of the depositor;
    (3) The date of deposit;
    (4) The identity of the deposit and the accession number given by 
the depository;
    (5) The date of the viability test;
    (6) The procedures used to obtain a sample if the test is not done 
by the depository; and
    (7) A statement that the deposit is capable of reproduction.
    (c) If a viability test indicates that the deposit is not viable 
upon receipt, or the examiner cannot, for scientific or other valid 
reasons, accept the statement of viability received from the applicant, 
the examiner shall proceed as if no deposit has been made. The examiner 
will accept the conclusion set forth in a viability statement issued by 
a depository recognized under Sec. 1.803(a).


<R05>
Sec. 1.808  Furnishing of samples.

    (a) A deposit must be made under conditions that assure that:
    (1) Access to the deposit will be available during pendency of the 
patent application making reference to the deposit to one determined by 
the Commissioner to be entitled thereto under Sec. 1.14 and 35 U.S.C. 
122, and
    (2) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, all restrictions 
imposed by the depositor on the availability to the public of the 
deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the granting of the 
patent.
    (b) The depositor may contract with the depository to require that 
samples of a deposited biological material shall be furnished only if a 
request for a sample, during the term of the patent:
    (1) Is in writing or other tangible form and dated;
    (2) Contains the name and address of the requesting party and the 
accession number of the deposit; and
    (3) Is communicated in writing by the depository to the depositor 
along with the date on which the sample was furnished and the name and 
address of the party to whom the sample was furnished.
    (c) Upon request made to the Office, the Office will certify whether 
a deposit has been stated to have been made under conditions which make 
it available to the public as of the issue date of the patent grant 
provided the request contains:
    (1) The name and address of the depository;
    (2) The accession number given to the deposit;
    (3) The patent number and issue date of the patent referring to the 
deposit; and
    (4) The name and address of the requesting party.


<R05>
Sec. 1.809  Examination procedures.

    (a) The examiner shall determine pursuant to Sec. 1.104 in each 
application for patent, application for reissue patent or reexamination 
proceeding if a deposit is needed, and if needed, if a deposit actually 
made is acceptable for patent purposes. If a deposit is needed and has 
not been made or replaced or supplemented in accordance with these 
regulations, the examiner, where appropriate, shall reject the affected 
claims under the appropriate provision of 35 U.S.C. 112, explaining why 
a deposit is needed and/or why a deposit actually made cannot be 
accepted.
    (b) The applicant for patent or patent owner shall reply to a 
rejection under paragraph (a) of this section by--
    (1) In the case of an applicant for patent, either making an 
acceptable original, replacement, or supplemental deposit, or assuring 
the Office in writing that an acceptable deposit will be made; or, in 
the case of a patent owner, requesting a certificate of correction of 
the patent which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
Sec. 1.805, or
    (2) Arguing why a deposit is not needed under the circumstances of 
the application or patent considered and/or why a deposit actually made 
should be accepted. Other replies to the examiner's action shall be 
considered nonresponsive. The rejection will be repeated until either 
paragraph (b)(1) of

[[Page 197]]

this section is satisfied or the examiner is convinced that a deposit is 
not needed.
    (c) If an application for patent is otherwise in condition for 
allowance except for a needed deposit and the Office has received a 
written assurance that an acceptable deposit will be made, applicant 
will be notified and given a period of time within which the deposit 
must be made in order to avoid abandonment. This time period is not 
extendable under Sec. 1.136(a) or (b) if set forth in a ``Notice of 
Allowability'' or in an Office action having a mail date on or after the 
mail date of a ``Notice of Allowability'' (see Sec. 1.136(c)).
    (d) For each deposit made pursuant to these regulations, the 
specification shall contain:
    (1) The accession number for the deposit;
    (2) The date of the deposit;
    (3) A description of the deposited biological material sufficient to 
specifically identify it and to permit examination; and
    (4) The name and address of the depository.
    (e) Any amendment required by paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) or (d)(4) of 
this section must be filed before or with the payment of the issue fee 
(see Sec. 1.312).

(1998), Appendix 2, Table 3. Those amino acid sequences containing D-
amino acids are not intended to be embraced by this definition. Any 
amino acid sequence that contains post-translationally modified amino 
acids may be described as the amino acid sequence that is initially 
translated using the symbols shown in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), 
Appendix 2, Table 3 with the modified positions; e.g., hydroxylations or 
glycosylations, being described as set forth in WIPO Standard ST.25 
(1998), Appendix 2, Table 4, but these modifications shall not be shown 
explicitly in the amino

acid sequence. Any peptide or protein that can be expressed as a 
sequence using the symbols in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, 
Table 3 in conjunction with a description in the Feature section to 
describe, for example, modified linkages, cross links and end caps, non-
peptidyl bonds, etc., is embraced by this definition.
    (b) Patent applications which contain disclosures of nucleotide and/
or amino acid sequences, in accordance with the definition in paragraph 
(a) of this section, shall, with regard to the manner in which the 
nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences are presented and described, 
conform exclusively to the requirements of Secs. 1.821 through 1.825.
    (c) Patent applications which contain disclosures of nucleotide and/
or amino acid sequences must contain, as a separate part of the 
disclosure, a paper or compact disc copy (see Sec. 1.52(e)) disclosing 
the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences and associated information 
using the symbols and format in accordance with the requirements of 
Secs. 1.822 and 1.823. This paper or compact disc copy is referred to 
elsewhere in this subpart as the ``Sequence Listing.'' Each sequence 
disclosed must appear separately in the ``Sequence Listing.'' Each 
sequence set forth in the ``Sequence Listing'' must be assigned a 
separate sequence identifier. The sequence identifiers must begin with 1 
and increase sequentially by integers. If no sequence is present for a 
sequence identifier, the code ``000'' must be used in place of the 
sequence. The response for the numeric identifier <160<ls-thn-eq> must 
include the total number of SEQ ID NOs, whether followed by a sequence 
or by the code ``000.''
    (d) Where the description or claims of a patent application discuss 
a sequence that is set forth in the ``Sequence Listing'' in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section, reference must be made to the 
sequence by use of the sequence identifier, preceded by ``SEQ ID NO:'' 
in the text of the description or claims, even if the sequence is also 
embedded in the text of the description or claims of the patent 
application.
    (e) A copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' referred to in paragraph (c) 
of this section must also be submitted in computer readable form (CRF) 
in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.824. The computer readable 
form must be a copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' and may not be retained 
as a part of the patent application file. If the computer readable form 
of a new application is to be identical with the computer readable form 
of another application of the applicant on file in the Office, reference 
may be made to the other application and computer readable form in lieu 
of filing a duplicate computer readable form in the new application if 
the computer readable form in the other application was compliant with 
all of the requirements of this subpart. The new application must be 
accompanied by a letter making such reference to the other application 
and computer readable form, both of which shall be completely 
identified. In the new application, applicant must also request the use 
of the compliant computer readable ``Sequence Listing'' that is already 
on file for the other application and must state that the paper or 
compact disc copy of the ``Sequence Listing'' in the new application is 
identical to the computer readable copy filed for the other application.
    (f) In addition to the paper or compact disc copy required by 
paragraph (c) of this section and the computer readable form required by 
paragraph (e) of this section, a statement that the ``Sequence Listing'' 
content of the paper or compact disc copy and the computer readable copy 
are the same must be submitted with the computer readable form, e.g., a 
statement that ``the sequence listing information recorded in computer 
readable form is identical to the written (on paper or compact disc) 
sequence listing.''
    (g) If any of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section are not satisfied at the time of filing under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) 
or at the time of entering the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371, 
applicant will be notified and given a period of time within which to 
comply with such requirements in order to prevent abandonment of the 
application. Any submission in reply to a requirement under this 
paragraph must be accompanied by a statement that the submission 
includes no new matter.

[[Page 199]]

    (h) If any of the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this 
section are not satisfied at the time of filing an international 
application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which application 
is to be searched by the United States International Searching Authority 
or examined by the United States International Preliminary Examining 
Authority, applicant will be sent a notice necessitating compliance with 
the requirements within a prescribed time period. Any submission in 
reply to a requirement under this paragraph must be accompanied by a 
statement that the submission does not include matter which goes beyond 
the disclosure in the international application as filed. If applicant 
fails to timely provide the required computer readable form, the United 
States International Searching Authority shall search only to the extent 
that a meaningful search can be performed without the computer readable 
form and the United States International Preliminary Examining Authority 
shall examine only to the extent that a meaningful examination can be 
performed without the computer readable form.

Sec. 1.822  Symbols and format to be used for nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data.

    (a) The symbols and format to be used for nucleotide and/or amino 
acid sequence data shall conform to the requirements of paragraphs (b) 
through (e) of this section.
    (b) The code for representing the nucleotide and/or amino acid 
sequence characters shall conform to the code set forth in the tables in 
WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Tables 1 and 3. This 
incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal 
Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies of 
ST.25 may be obtained from the World Intellectual Property Organization; 
34 chemin des Colombettes; 1211 Geneva 20 Switzerland. Copies of ST.25 
may be inspected at the Patent Search Room; Crystal Plaza 3, Lobby 
Level; 2021 South Clark Place; Arlington, VA 22202. Copies may also be 
inspected at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol 
Street, NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC. No code other than that specified 
in these sections shall be used in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. 
A modified base or modified or unusual amino acid may be presented in a 
given sequence as the corresponding unmodified base or amino acid if the 
modified base or modified or unusual amino acid is one of those listed 
in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Tables 2 and 4, and the 
modification is also set forth in the Feature section. Otherwise, each 
occurrence of a base or amino acid not appearing in WIPO Standard ST.25 
(1998), Appendix 2, Tables 1 and 3, shall be listed in a given sequence 
as ``n'' or ``Xaa,'' respectively, with further information, as 
appropriate, given in the Feature section, preferably by including one 
or more feature keys listed in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, 
Tables 5 and 6.
    (c) Format representation of nucleotides. (1) A nucleotide sequence 
shall be listed using the lower-case letter for representing the one-
letter code for the nucleotide bases set forth in WIPO Standard ST.25 
(1998), Appendix 2, Table 1.
    (2) The bases in a nucleotide sequence (including introns) shall be 
listed in groups of 10 bases except in the coding parts of the sequence. 
Leftover bases, fewer than 10 in number, at the end of noncoding parts 
of a sequence shall be grouped together and separated from adjacent 
groups of 10 or 3 bases by a space.
    (3) The bases in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence shall be 
listed as triplets (codons). The amino acids corresponding to the codons 
in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence shall be typed immediately 
below the corresponding codons. Where a codon spans an intron, the amino 
acid symbol shall be typed below the portion of the codon containing two 
nucleotides.
    (4) A nucleotide sequence shall be listed with a maximum of 16 
codons or 60 bases per line, with a space provided between each codon or 
group of 10 bases.
    (5) A nucleotide sequence shall be presented, only by a single 
strand, in the 5 to 3 direction, from left to right.

[[Page 200]]

    (6) The enumeration of nucleotide bases shall start at the first 
base of the sequence with number 1. The enumeration shall be continuous 
through the whole sequence in the direction 5 to 3. The enumeration 
shall be marked in the right margin, next to the line containing the 
one-letter codes for the bases, and giving the number of the last base 
of that line.
    (7) For those nucleotide sequences that are circular in 
configuration, the enumeration method set forth in paragraph (c)(6) of 
this section remains applicable with the exception that the designation 
of the first base of the nucleotide sequence may be made at the option 
of the applicant.
    (d) Representation of amino acids. (1) The amino acids in a protein 
or peptide sequence shall be listed using the three-letter abbreviation 
with the first letter as an upper case character, as in WIPO Standard 
ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Table 3.
    (2) A protein or peptide sequence shall be listed with a maximum of 
16 amino acids per line, with a space provided between each amino acid.
    (3) An amino acid sequence shall be presented in the amino to 
carboxy direction, from left to right, and the amino and carboxy groups 
shall not be presented in the sequence.
    (4) The enumeration of amino acids may start at the first amino acid 
of the first mature protein, with the number 1. When presented, the 
amino acids preceding the mature protein, e.g., pre-sequences, pro-
sequences, pre-pro-sequences and signal sequences, shall have negative 
numbers, counting backwards starting with the amino acid next to number 
1. Otherwise, the enumeration of amino acids shall start at the first 
amino acid at the amino terminal as number 1. It shall be marked below 
the sequence every 5 amino acids. The enumeration method for amino acid 
sequences that is set forth in this section remains applicable for amino 
acid sequences that are circular in configuration, with the exception 
that the designation of the first amino acid of the sequence may be made 
at the option of the applicant.
    (5) An amino acid sequence that contains internal terminator symbols 
(e.g., ``Ter'', ``*'', or ``.'', etc.) may not be represented as a 
single amino acid sequence, but shall be presented as separate amino 
acid sequences.
    (e) A sequence with a gap or gaps shall be presented as a plurality 
of separate sequences, with separate sequence identifiers, with the 
number of separate sequences being equal in number to the number of 
continuous strings of sequence data. A sequence that is made up of one 
or more noncontiguous segments of a larger sequence or segments from 
different sequences shall be presented as a separate sequence.

Sec. 1.823  Requirements for nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as part of the application.

    (a)(1) If the ``Sequence Listing'' required by Sec. 1.821(c) is 
submitted on paper: The ``Sequence Listing,'' setting forth the 
nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence and associated information in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must begin on a new page 
and must be titled ``Sequence Listing.'' The pages of the ``Sequence 
Listing'' preferably should be numbered independently of the numbering 
of the remainder of the application. Each page of the ``Sequence 
Listing'' shall contain no more than 66 lines and each line shall 
contain no more than 72 characters. A fixed-width font should be used 
exclusively throughout the ``Sequence Listing.''
    (2) If the ``Sequence Listing'' required by Sec. 1.821(c) is 
submitted on compact disc: The ``Sequence Listing'' must be submitted on 
a compact disc in compliance with Sec. 1.52(e). The compact disc may 
also contain table information if the application contains table 
information that may be submitted on a compact disc 
(Sec. 1.52(e)(1)(iii)). The specification must contain an incorporation-
by-reference of the Sequence Listing as required by Sec. 1.52(e)(5). The 
presentation of the ``Sequence Listing'' and other materials on compact 
disc under Sec. 1.821(c) does not substitute for the Computer Readable 
Form that must be submitted on disk, compact disc, or tape in accordance 
with Sec. 1.824.
    (b) The ``Sequence Listing'' shall, except as otherwise indicated, 
include the

[[Page 201]]

actual nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, the numeric identifiers 
and their accompanying information as shown in the following table. The 
numeric identifier shall be used only in the ``Sequence Listing.'' The 
order and presentation of the items of information in the ``Sequence 
Listing'' shall conform to the arrangement given below. Each item of 
information shall begin on a new line and shall begin with the numeric 
identifier enclosed in angle brackets as shown. The submission of those 
items of information designated with an ``M'' is mandatory. The 
submission of those items of information designated with an ``O'' is 
optional. Numeric identifiers <110<ls-thn-eq> through <170<ls-thn-eq>

<R05>
Sec. 1.902  Processing of prior art citations during an inter partes reexamination proceeding.

    Citations by the patent owner in accordance with Sec. 1.933 and by 
an inter partes reexamination third party requester under Sec. 1.915 or 
Sec. 1.948 will be entered in the inter partes reexamination file. The 
entry in the patent file of other citations submitted after the date of 
an order for reexamination pursuant to Sec. 1.931 by persons other than

art citations in patent and reexamination files during an ex parte 
reexamination proceeding filed under Sec. 1.510.

         Requirements for Inter Partes Reexamination Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 1.903  Service of papers on parties in inter partes reexamination.

    The patent owner and the third party requester will be sent copies 
of Office actions issued during the inter partes reexamination 
proceeding. After filing of a request for inter partes reexamination by 
a third party requester, any document filed by either the patent owner 
or the third party requester must be served on every other party in the 
reexamination proceeding in the manner provided in Sec. 1.248. Any 
document must reflect service or the document may be refused 
consideration by the Office. The failure of the patent owner or the 
third party requester to serve documents may result in their being 
refused consideration.


<R05>
Sec. 1.904  Notice of inter partes reexamination in Official Gazette.

    A notice of the filing of an inter partes reexamination request will 
be published in the Official Gazette. The notice published in the 
Official Gazette under Sec. 1.11(c) will be considered to be 
constructive notice of the inter partes reexamination proceeding and 
inter partes reexamination will proceed.


<R05>
Sec. 1.905  Submission of papers by the public in inter partes reexamination.

    Unless specifically provided for, no submissions on behalf of any 
third parties other than third party requesters as defined in 35 U.S.C. 
100(e) will be considered unless such submissions are in accordance with 
Sec. 1.915 or entered in the patent file prior to the date of the order 
for reexamination pursuant to Sec. 1.931. Submissions by third parties, 
other than third party requesters, filed after the date of the order for 
reexamination pursuant to Sec. 1.931, must meet the requirements of 
Sec. 1.501 and will be treated in accordance with Sec. 1.902. 
Submissions which do not meet the requirements of Sec. 1.501 will be 
returned.


<R05>
Sec. 1.906  Scope of reexamination in inter partes reexamination proceeding.

    (a) Claims in an inter partes reexamination proceeding will be 
examined on the basis of patents or printed publications and, with 
respect to subject matter added or deleted in the reexamination 
proceeding, on the basis of the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112.
    (b) Claims in an inter partes reexamination proceeding will not be 
permitted to enlarge the scope of the claims of the patent.
    (c) Issues other than those indicated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section will not be resolved in an inter partes reexamination 
proceeding. If such issues are raised by the patent owner or the third 
party requester during a reexamination proceeding, the existence of such 
issues will be noted by the examiner in the next Office action, in which 
case the patent owner may desire to consider the advisability of filing 
a reissue application to have such issues considered and resolved.

[[Page 209]]


<R05>
Sec. 1.907  Inter partes reexamination prohibited.

    (a) Once an order to reexamine has been issued under Sec. 1.931, 
neither the third party requester, nor its privies, may file a 
subsequent request for inter partes reexamination of the patent until an 
inter partes reexamination certificate is issued under Sec. 1.997, 
unless authorized by the Commissioner.
    (b) Once a final decision has been entered against a party in a 
civil action arising in whole or in part under 28 U.S.C. 1338 that the 
party has not sustained its burden of proving invalidity of any patent 
claim-in-suit, then neither that party nor its privies may thereafter 
request inter partes reexamination of any such patent claim on the basis 
of issues which that party, or its privies, raised or could have raised 
in such civil action, and an inter partes reexamination requested by 
that party, or its privies, on the basis of such issues may not 
thereafter be maintained by the Office.
    (c) If a final decision in an inter partes reexamination proceeding 
instituted by a third party requester is favorable to patentability of 
any original, proposed amended, or new claims of the patent, then 
neither that party nor its privies may thereafter request inter partes 
reexamination of any such patent claims on the basis of issues which 
that party, or its privies, raised or could have raised in such inter 
partes reexamination proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1.913  Persons eligible to file request for inter partes reexamination.

    Except as provided for in Sec. 1.907, any person may, at any time 
during the period of enforceability of a patent which issued from an 
original application filed in the United States on or after November 29,

patents and printed publications to every claim for which reexamination 
is requested.
    (4) A copy of every patent or printed publication relied upon or 
referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section, 
accompanied by an English language translation of all the necessary and 
pertinent parts of any non-English language document.
    (5) A copy of the entire patent including the front face, drawings, 
and specification/claims (in double column format) for which

of paper.
    (6) A certification by the third party requester that a copy of the 
request has been served in its entirety on the patent owner at the 
address provided for in Sec. 1.33(c). The name and address of the party 
served must be indicated. If service was not possible, a duplicate copy 
of the request must be supplied to the Office.
    (7) A certification by the third party requester that the estoppel 
provisions of Sec. 1.907 do not prohibit the inter partes reexamination.
    (8) A statement identifying the real party in interest to the extent 
necessary for a subsequent person filing an inter partes reexamination 
request to determine whether that person is a privy.
    (c) If an inter partes request is filed by an attorney or agent 
identifying another party on whose behalf the request is being filed, 
the attorney or agent must have a power of attorney

[[Page 210]]

from that party or be acting in a representative capacity pursuant to 
Sec. 1.34(a).
    (d) If the inter partes request does not meet all the requirements 
of subsection 1.915(b), the person identified as requesting inter partes 
reexamination may be so notified and given an opportunity to complete 
the formal requirements of the request within a specified time. Failure 
to comply with the notice may result in the inter partes reexamination 
proceeding being vacated.


<R05>
Sec. 1.919  Filing date of request for inter partes reexamination.

    (a) The filing date of a request for inter partes reexamination is 
the date on which the request satisfies the fee requirement of 
Sec. 1.915(a).
    (b) If the request is not granted a filing date, the request will be 
placed in the patent file as a citation of prior art if it complies with 
the requirements of Sec. 1.501.


<R05>
Sec. 1.923  Examiner's determination on the request for inter partes reexamination.

    Within three months following the filing date of a request for inter 
partes reexamination under Sec. 1.919, the examiner will consider the 
request and determine whether or not a substantial new question of 
patentability affecting any claim of the patent is raised by the request 
and the prior art citation. The examiner's determination will be based 
on the claims in effect at the time of the determination, will become a 
part of the official file of the patent, and will be mailed to the 
patent owner at the address as provided for in Sec. 1.33(c) and to the 
third party requester. If the examiner determines that no substantial 
new question of patentability is present, the examiner shall refuse the 
request and shall not order inter partes reexamination.


<R05>
Sec. 1.925  Partial refund if request for inter partes reexamination is not ordered.

    Where inter partes reexamination is not ordered, a refund of a 
portion of the fee for requesting inter partes reexamination will be 
made to the requester in accordance with Sec. 1.26(c).


<R05>
Sec. 1.927  Petition to review refusal to order inter partes reexamination.

    The third party requester may seek review by a petition to the 
Commissioner underSec. 1.181 within one month of the mailing date of the 
examiner's determination refusing to order inter partes reexamination. 
Any such petition must comply with Sec. 1.181(b). If no petition is 
timely filed or if the decision on petition affirms that no substantial 
new question of patentability has been raised, the determination shall 
be final and nonappealable.

                  Inter Partes Reexamination of Patents


<R05>
Sec. 1.931  Order for inter partes reexamination.

    (a) If a substantial new question of patentability is found, the 
determination will include an order for inter partes reexamination of 
the patent for resolution of the question.
    (b) If the order for inter partes reexamination resulted from a 
petition pursuant to Sec. 1.927, the inter partes reexamination will 
ordinarily be conducted by an examiner other than the examiner 
responsible for the initial determination under Sec. 1.923.

          Information Disclosure in Inter Partes Reexamination


<R05>
Sec. 1.933  Patent owner duty of disclosure in inter partes reexamination proceedings.

    (a) Each individual associated with the patent owner in an inter 
partes reexamination proceeding has a duty of candor and good faith in 
dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office 
all information known to that individual to be material to patentability 
in a reexamination proceeding as set forth in Sec. 1.555(a) and (b). The 
duty to disclose all information known to be material to patentability 
in an inter partes reexamination proceeding is deemed to be satisfied by 
filing a paper in compliance with the requirements set forth in 
Sec. 1.555(a) and (b).
    (b) The responsibility for compliance with this section rests upon 
the individuals designated in paragraph (a) of this section, and no 
evaluation will be

this section. If questions of compliance with this section are raised by 
the patent owner or the third party requester during a reexamination 
proceeding, they will be noted as unresolved questions in accordance 
with Sec. 1.906(c).

    Each time the patent owner files a response to an Office action on 
the merits pursuant to Sec. 1.945, a third party requester may once file 
written comments within a period of 30 days from the date of service of 
the patent owner's response. These comments shall be limited to issues

Sec. 1.949  Examiner's Office action closing prosecution in inter partes reexamination.

    Upon consideration of the issues a second or subsequent time, or 
upon a determination of patentability of all claims, the examiner shall 
issue an Office action treating all claims present in the inter partes 
reexamination, which may be an action closing prosecution. The Office 
action shall set forth all rejections and determinations not to make a 
proposed rejection, and the grounds therefor. An Office action will not 
usually close prosecution if it includes a new ground of rejection which 
was not previously addressed by the patent owner, unless the new ground 
was necessitated by an amendment.

issues raised in the Office action closing prosecution. The comments can 
include a proposed amendment to the claims, which amendment will be 
subject to the criteria of Sec. 1.116 as to whether or not it shall be 
admitted. The comments must be filed within the time set for response in 
the Office action closing prosecution.
    (b) When the patent owner does file comments, a third party

Sec. 1.953  Examiner's Right of Appeal Notice in inter partes reexamination.

    (a) Upon considering the comments of the patent owner and the third 
party requester subsequent to the Office action closing prosecution in 
an inter partes reexamination, or upon expiration of the time for 
submitting such comments, the examiner shall issue a Right of Appeal 
Notice, unless the examiner reopens prosecution and issues another 
Office action on the merits.
    (b) Expedited Right of Appeal Notice: At any time after the patent 
owner's response to the initial Office action on the merits in an inter 
partes reexamination, the patent owner and all third party requesters 
may stipulate that the issues are appropriate for a final action, which 
would include a final rejection and/or a final determination favorable 
to patentability, and may request the issuance of a Right of Appeal 
Notice. The request must have the concurrence of the patent owner and 
all third party requesters present in the proceeding and must identify 
all the appealable issues and the positions of the patent owner and all 
third party requesters on those issues. If the examiner determines that 
no other issues are present or should be raised, a Right of Appeal 
Notice limited to the identified issues shall be issued. Any appeal by 
the parties shall be conducted in accordance with Secs. 1.959-1.983.
    (c) The Right of Appeal Notice shall be a final action, which 
comprises a final rejection setting forth each ground of rejection and/
or final decision favorable to patentability including each 
determination not to make a

[[Page 213]]

proposed rejection, an identification of the status of each claim, and 
the reasons for decisions favorable to patentability and/or the grounds 
of rejection for each claim. No amendment can be made in response to the 
Right of Appeal Notice. The Right of Appeal Notice shall set a one-month 
time period for either party to appeal. If no notice of appeal is filed, 
the inter partes reexamination proceeding will be terminated, and the 
Commissioner will proceed to issue a certificate under Sec. 1.997 in 
accordance with the Right of Appeal Notice.

Extensions of Time, Termination of Proceedings, and Petitions To Revive 
                      in Inter Partes Reexamination


<R05>
Sec. 1.956  Patent owner extensions of time in inter partes reexamination.

    The time for taking any action by a patent owner in an inter partes 
reexamination proceeding will be extended only for sufficient cause and 
for a reasonable time specified. Any request for such extension must be 
filed on or before the day on which action by the patent owner is due, 
but in no case will the mere filing of a request effect any extension. 
See Sec. 1.304(a) for extensions of time for filing a notice of appeal 
to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.


<R05>
Sec. 1.957  Failure to file a timely, appropriate or complete response or comment in inter partes reexamination.

    (a) If the third party requester files an untimely or inappropriate 
comment, notice of appeal or brief in an inter partes reexamination, the 
paper will be refused consideration.
    (b) If no claims are found patentable, and the patent owner fails to 
file a timely and appropriate response in an inter partes reexamination 
proceeding, the reexamination proceeding will be terminated and the 
Commissioner will proceed to issue a certificate under Sec. 1.997 in 
accordance with the last action of the Office.
    (c) If claims are found patentable and the patent owner fails to 
file a timely and appropriate response to any Office action in an inter 
partes reexamination proceeding, further prosecution will be limited to 
the claims found patentable at the time of the failure to respond, and 
to any claims added thereafter which do not expand the scope of the 
claims which were found patentable at that time.
    (d) When action by the patent owner is a bona fide attempt to 
respond and to advance the prosecution and is substantially a complete 
response to the Office action, but consideration of some matter or 
compliance with some requirement has been inadvertently omitted, an 
opportunity to explain and supply the omission may be given.


<R05>
Sec. 1.958  Petition to revive terminated inter partes reexamination or claims terminated for lack of patent owner response.

    (a) If a response by the patent owner is not timely filed in the 
Office, the delay in filing such response may be excused if it is shown 
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the delay was unavoidable. 
A grantable petition to accept an unavoidably delayed response must be 
filed in compliance with Sec. 1.137(a).
    (b) Any response by the patent owner not timely filed in the Office 
may be accepted if the delay was unintentional. A grantable petition to 
accept an unintentionally delayed response must be filed in compliance 
with Sec. 1.137(b).

with respect to any final decision favorable to the patentability, 
including any final determination not to make a proposed rejection, of 
any original, proposed amended, or new claim of the patent by filing a 
notice of appeal within the time provided in the Right of Appeal Notice 
and paying the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(b).
    (b)(1) Within fourteen days of service of a third party requester's 
notice of appeal under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and upon payment 
of the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(b), a patent owner who has not filed a 
notice of appeal may file a notice of cross appeal with respect to the

    (d) An appeal or cross appeal, when taken, must be taken from all 
the rejections of the claims in a Right of Appeal Notice which the 
patent owner proposes to contest or from all the determinations 
favorable to patentability, including any final determination not to

party requester proposes to contest. Questions relating to matters not 
affecting the merits of the invention may be required to be settled 
before an appeal is decided.
    (e) The times for filing a notice of appeal or cross appeal may not 
be extended.


<R05>
Sec. 1.961  Jurisdiction over appeal in inter partes reexamination.

    Jurisdiction over the inter partes reexamination proceeding passes 
to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences upon transmittal of the 
file, including all briefs and examiner's answers, to the Board of 
Patent Appeals and Interferences. Prior to the entry of a decision on 
the appeal, the Commissioner may sua sponte order the inter partes 
reexamination proceeding remanded to the examiner for action consistent 
with the Commissioner's order.


<R05>
Sec. 1.962  Appellant and respondent in inter partes reexamination defined.

    For the purposes of inter partes reexamination, appellant is any 
party, whether the patent owner or a third party requester, filing a 
notice of appeal or cross appeal. If more than one party appeals or 
cross appeals, each appealing or cross appealing party is an appellant 
with respect to the claims to which his or her appeal or cross appeal is 
directed. A respondent is any third party requester responding under 
Sec. 1.967 to the appellant's brief of the patent owner, or the patent 
owner responding under Sec. 1.967 to the appellant's brief of any third 
party requester. No third party requester may be a respondent to the 
appellant brief of any other third party requester.


<R05>

    (a)An appellant's brief in an inter partes reexamination must be 
filed no later than two months from the latest filing date of the last-
filed notice of appeal or cross appeal or, if any party to the inter 
partes reexamination is entitled to file an appeal or cross appeal but 
fails to timely do so, the expiration of time for filing (by the last 
party entitled to do so) such notice of appeal or cross appeal. The time 
for filing an appellant's brief may not be extended.
    (b) Once an appellant's brief has been properly filed, any brief 
must be filed

[[Page 215]]

by respondent within one month from the date of service of the 
appellant's brief. The time for filing a respondent's brief may not be 
extended.
    (c) The examiner will consider both the appellant's and respondent's 
briefs and may prepare an examiner's answer under Sec. 1.969.

one month of the date of the examiner's answer. The time for filing a 
rebuttal brief may not be extended.
    (e) No further submission will be considered and any such submission 
will be treated in accordance with Sec. 1.939.


<R05>
Sec. 1.965  Appellant's brief in inter partes reexamination.

    (a)Appellant(s) may once, within time limits for filing set forth in 
Sec. 1.963, file a brief in triplicate and serve the brief on all other 
parties to the inter partes reexamination proceeding in accordance with 
Sec. 1.903. The brief must be signed by the appellant, or the 
appellant's duly authorized attorney or agent and must be accompanied by 
the requisite fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(c). The brief must set forth 
the authorities and arguments on which appellant will rely to maintain 
the appeal. Any arguments or authorities not included in the brief will 
be refused consideration by the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences, unless good cause is shown.
    (b) A party's appeal shall stand dismissed upon failure of that 
party to file an appellant's brief, accompanied by the requisite fee, 
within the time allowed.
    (c) The appellant's brief shall contain the following items under 
appropriate headings and in the order indicated below, unless the brief 
is filed by a party who is not represented by a registered practitioner. 
The brief may include an appendix containing only those portions of the 
record on which reliance has been made.
    (1) Real Party in Interest. A statement identifying the real party 
in interest.
    (2) Related Appeals and Interferences. A statement identifying by 
number and filing date all other appeals or interferences known to the 
appellant, the appellant's legal representative, or assignee which will 
directly affect or be directly affected by or have a bearing on the 
decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in the pending 
appeal.
    (3) Status of Claims. A statement of the status of all the claims, 
pending or canceled. If the appellant is the patent owner, the appellant 
must also identify the rejected claims whose rejection is being 
appealed. If the appellant is a third party requester, the appellant 
must identify the claims that the examiner has made a determination 
favorable to patentability, which determination is being appealed.
    (4) Status of Amendments. A statement of the status of any amendment 
filed subsequent to the close of prosecution.
    (5) Summary of Invention. A concise explanation of the invention or 
subject matter defined in the claims involved in the appeal, which shall 
refer to the specification by column and line number, and to the 
drawing(s), if any, by reference characters.
    (6) Issues. A concise statement of the issues presented for review. 
No new ground of rejection can be proposed by a third party requester 
appellant.
    (7) Grouping of Claims. If the appellant is the patent owner, for 
each ground of rejection in the Right of Appeal Notice which appellant 
contests and which applies to a group of two or more claims, the Board 
of Patent Appeals and Interferences shall select a single claim from the 
group and shall decide the appeal as to the ground of rejection on the 
basis of that claim alone unless a statement is included that the claims 
of the group do not stand or fall together; and, in the argument under 
paragraph (c)(8) of this section, appellant explains why the claims of 
this group are believed to be separately patentable. Merely pointing out 
differences in what the claims cover is not an argument as to why the 
claims are separately patentable.
    (8) Argument. The contentions of appellant with respect to each of 
the issues presented for review in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, and 
the bases therefor, with citations of the authorities, statutes, and 
parts of the record relied on. Each issue should be treated under a 
separate, numbered heading.

[[Page 216]]

    (i) For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or for 
each determination favorable to patentability, including a determination 
not to make a proposed rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, 
which appellant contests, the argument shall specify the errors in the 
rejection or the determination and how the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 
112 is complied with, if the appellant is the patent owner, or is not 
complied with, if the appellant is a third party requester, including, 
as appropriate, how the specification and drawing(s), if any,
    (A) Describe, if the appellant is the patent owner, or fail to 
describe, if the appellant is a third party requester, the subject 
matter defined by each of the appealed claims; and
    (B) Enable, if the appellant is the patent owner, or fail to enable, 
if the appellant is a third party requester, any person skilled in the 
art to make and use the subject matter defined by each of the appealed 
claims.
    (ii) For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, or 
for each determination favorable to patentability including a 
determination not to make a proposed rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112, 
second paragraph, which appellant contests, the argument shall specify 
the errors in the rejection, if the appellant is the patent owner, or 
the determination, if the appellant is a third party requester, and how 
the claims do, if the appellant is the patent owner, or do not, if the 
appellant is a third party requester, particularly point out and 
distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor regards as the 
invention.
    (iii) For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102 or for each 
determination favorable to patentability including a determination not 
to make a proposed rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102 which appellant 
contests, the argument shall specify the errors in the rejection, if the 
appellant is the patent owner, or determination, if the appellant is a 
third party requester, and why the appealed claims are, if the appellant 
is the patent owner, or are not, if the appellant is a third party 
requester, patentable under 35 U.S.C. 102, including any specific 
limitations in the appealed claims which are or are not described in the 
prior art.
    (iv) For each rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 or for each 
determination favorable to patentability, including a determination not 
to make a proposed rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 which appellant 
contests, the argument shall specify the errors in the rejection, if the 
appellant is the patent owner, or determination, if the appellant is a 
third party requester. If appropriate, also state the specific 
limitations in the appealed claims which are or are not described in the 
prior art and explain how such limitations render the claimed subject 
matter obvious, if the appellant is a third party requester, or 
unobvious, if the appellant is the patent owner, over the prior art. If 
the rejection or determination is based upon a combination of 
references, the argument shall explain why the references, taken as a 
whole, do or do not suggest the claimed subject matter. The argument 
should include, as may be appropriate, an explanation of why features 
disclosed in one reference may or may not properly be combined with 
features disclosed in another reference. A general argument that all the 
limitations are or are not described in a single reference does not 
satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.
    (v) For any rejection other than those referred to in paragraphs 
(c)(8)(i) to (iv) of this section or for each determination favorable to 
patentability, including any determination not to make a proposed 
rejection other than those referred to in paragraphs (c)(8)(i) to (iv) 
of this section which appellant contests, the argument shall specify the 
errors in the rejection, if the appellant is the patent owner, or 
determination, if the appellant is a third party requester, and the 
specific limitations in the appealed claims, if appropriate, or other 
reasons, which cause the rejection or determination to be in error.
    (9) Appendix. An appendix containing a copy of the claims appealed 
by the appellant.
    (10) Certificate of Service. A certification that a copy of the 
brief has been served in its entirety on all other parties to the 
reexamination proceeding. The names and addresses of the parties served 
must be indicated.

[[Page 217]]

    (d) If a brief is filed which does not comply with all the 
requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, appellant will be 
notified of the reasons for non-compliance and provided with a non-
extendable period of one month within which to file an amended brief. If 
the appellant does not file an amended brief during the one-month 
period, or files an amended brief which does not overcome all the 
reasons for non-compliance stated in the notification, that appellant's 
appeal will stand dismissed.

pending appeal.
    (3) Status of claims. A statement accepting or disputing appellant's 
statement of the status of claims. If appellant's statement of the 
status of claims is disputed, the errors in appellant's statement must 
be specified with particularity.
    (4) Status of amendments. A statement accepting or disputing 
appellant's statement of the status of amendments. If appellant's 
statement of the status of amendments is disputed, the errors in 
appellant's statement must be specified with particularity.

respondent considers such a hearing necessary or desirable for a proper 
presentation of the appeal. An appeal decided without an oral hearing 
will receive the same consideration by the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences as an appeal decided after oral hearing.
    (b) If an appellant or a respondent desires an oral hearing, he or 
she must file a written request for such hearing accompanied by the fee 
set forth in Sec. 1.17(d) within two months after the date of the 
examiner's answer. The time for requesting an oral hearing may not be 
extended.
    (c) An oral argument may be presented at oral hearing by, or on 
behalf of, the primary examiner if considered desirable by either the 
primary examiner or the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.
    (d) If an appellant or a respondent has requested an oral hearing 
and has submitted the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(d), a hearing date will 
be set, and notice given to all parties to the reexamination proceeding, 
as well as the primary examiner. The notice shall set a non-extendable 
period within which all requests for oral hearing shall be submitted by 
any other party to the appeal desiring to participate in the oral 
hearing. A hearing will be held as stated in the notice, and oral 
argument will be limited to thirty minutes for each appellant and 
respondent who has requested an oral hearing, and twenty minutes for the 
primary examiner unless otherwise ordered before the hearing begins. No 
appellant or respondent will be permitted to participate in an

[[Page 219]]

oral hearing unless he or she has requested an oral hearing and 
submitted the fee set forth in Sec. 1.17(d).
    (e) If no request and fee for oral hearing have been timely filed by 
an appellant or a respondent, the appeal will be assigned for 
consideration and decision on the written record.


<R05>
Sec. 1.975  Affidavits or declarations after appeal in inter partes reexamination.

    Affidavits, declarations, or exhibits submitted after the inter 
partes reexamination has been appealed will not be admitted without a 
showing of good and sufficient reasons why they were not earlier 
presented.


<R05>
Sec. 1.977  Decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences; remand to examiner in inter partes reexamination.

    (a) The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, in its decision, 
may affirm or reverse each decision of the examiner on all issues raised 
on each appealed claim, or remand the reexamination proceeding to the 
examiner for further consideration. The reversal of the examiner's 
determination not to make a rejection proposed by the third party 
requester constitutes a decision adverse to the patentability of the 
claims which are subject to that proposed rejection which will be set 
forth in the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences 
as a new ground of rejection under paragraph (b) of this section. The 
affirmance of the rejection of a claim on any of the grounds specified 
constitutes a general affirmance of the decision of the examiner on that 
claim, except as to any ground specifically reversed.
    (b) Should the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences have 
knowledge of any grounds not raised in the appeal for rejecting any 
pending claim, it may include in the decision a statement to that effect 
with its reasons for so holding, which statement shall constitute a new 
ground of rejection of the claim. A decision which includes a new ground 
of rejection shall not be considered final for purposes of judicial 
review. When the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences makes a new 
ground of rejection, the patent owner, within one month from the date of 
the decision, must exercise one of the following two options with 
respect to the new ground of rejection to avoid termination of the 
appeal proceeding as to the rejected claim:
    (1) The patent owner may submit an appropriate amendment of the 
claim so rejected or a showing of facts relating to the claim, or both.
    (2) The patent owner may file a request for rehearing of the 
decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences under 
Sec. 1.979(a).
    (c) Where the patent owner has responded under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, any third party requester, within one month of the date of 
service of the patent owner response, may once file comments on the 
response. Such written comments must be limited to the issues raised by 
the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences and the 
patent owner's response. Any third party requester that had not 
previously filed an appeal or cross appeal and is seeking under this 
subsection to file comments or a reply to the comments is subject to the 
appeal and brief fees under Sec. 1.17(b) and (c), respectively, which 
must accompany the comments or reply.
    (d) Following any response by the patent owner under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section and any written comments from a third party 
requester under paragraph (c) of this section, the reexamination 
proceeding will be remanded to the examiner. The statement of the Board 
of Patent Appeals and Interferences shall be binding upon the examiner 
unless an amendment or showing of facts not previously of record be made 
which, in the opinion of the examiner, overcomes the new ground of 
rejection. The examiner will consider any response under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section and any written comments by a third party 
requester under paragraph (c) of this section and issue a determination 
that the rejection should be maintained or has been overcome.
    (e) Within one month of the examiner's determination pursuant to 
paragraph (d) of this section, the patent owner or any third party 
requester may once submit comments in response to the examiner's 
determination. Within one month of the date of service of comments in 
response to the

[[Page 220]]

examiner's determination, any party may file a reply to the comments. No 
third party requester reply may address the comments of any other third 
party requester reply. Any third party requester that had not previously 
filed an appeal or cross appeal and is seeking under this subsection to 
file comments or a reply to the comments is subject to the appeal and 
brief fees under Sec. 1.17(b) and (c), respectively, which must 
accompany the comments or reply.
    (f) After submission of any comments and any reply pursuant to 
paragraph (e) of this section, or after time has expired, the 
reexamination proceeding will be returned to the Board of Patent Appeals 
and Interferences which shall reconsider the matter and issue a new 
decision. The new decision will incorporate the earlier decision, except 
for those portions specifically withdrawn.
    (g) The time period set forth in paragraph (b) of this section is 
subject to the extension of time provisions of Sec. 1.956. The time 
periods set forth in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this section may not be 
extended.


<R05>
Sec. 1.979  Action following decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences or dismissal of appeal in inter partes reexamination.

    (a) Parties to the appeal may file a request for rehearing of the 
decision within one month of the date of:
    (1) The original decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences under Sec. 1.977(a),
    (2) The original Sec. 1.977(b) decision under the provisions of 
Sec. 1.977(b)(2),
    (3) The expiration of the time for the patent owner to take action 
under Sec. 1.977(b)(2), or
    (4) The new decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences under Sec. 1.977(f).
    (b) Within one month of the date of service of any request for 
rehearing under paragraph (a) of this section, or any further request 
for rehearing under paragraph (c) of this section, any party to the 
appeal may once file comments in opposition to the request for rehearing 
or the further request for rehearing. The comments in opposition must be 
limited to the issues raised in the request for rehearing or the further 
request for rehearing.
    (c) If a party to an appeal files a request for rehearing under 
paragraph (a) of this section, or a further request for rehearing under 
this section, the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences will issue a 
decision on rehearing. This decision is deemed to incorporate the 
earlier decision, except for those portions specifically withdrawn. If 
the decision on rehearing becomes, in effect, a new decision, and the 
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences so states, then any party to 
the appeal may, within one month of the new decision, file a further 
request for rehearing of the new decision under this subsection.
    (d) Any request for rehearing shall state the points believed to 
have been misapprehended or overlooked in rendering the decision and 
also state all other grounds upon which rehearing is sought.
    (e) The patent owner may not appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit under Sec. 1.983 until all parties' rights to 
request rehearing have been exhausted, at which time the decision of the 
Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences is final and appealable by the 
patent owner.
    (f) An appeal by a third party requester is considered terminated by 
the dismissal of the third party requester's appeal, the failure of the 
third party requester to timely request rehearing under Sec. 1.979(a) or 
(c), or a final decision under Sec. 1.979(e). The date of such 
termination is the date on which the appeal is dismissed, the date on 
which the time for rehearing expires, or the decision of the Board of 
Patent Appeals and Interferences is final. An appeal by the patent owner 
is considered terminated by the dismissal of the patent owner's appeal, 
the failure of the patent owner to timely request rehearing under 
Sec. 1.979(a) or (c), or the failure of the patent owner to timely file 
an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under 
Sec. 1.983. The date of such termination is the date on which the appeal 
is dismissed, the date on which the time for rehearing expires, or the 
date on which the time for the patent owner's appeal to the U.S.

[[Page 221]]

Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit expires. If an appeal to the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has been filed, the patent 
owner's appeal is considered terminated when the mandate is received by 
the Office. Upon termination of an appeal, if no other appeal is 
present, the reexamination proceeding will be terminated and the 
Commissioner will issue a certificate under Sec. 1.997.
    (g) The times for requesting rehearing under paragraph (a) of this 
section, for requesting further rehearing under paragraph (c) of this 
section, and for submitting comments under paragraph (b) of this section 
may not be extended.


<R05>
Sec. 1.981  Reopening after decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in inter partes reexamination.

    Cases which have been decided by the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences will not be reopened or reconsidered by the primary 
examiner except under the provisions of Sec. 1.977 without the written 
authority of the Commissioner, and then only for the consideration of 
matters not already adjudicated, sufficient cause being shown.

   Patent Owner Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the 
              Federal Circuit in Inter Partes Reexamination


<R05>
Sec. 1.983  Patent owner appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in inter partes reexamination.

    (a) The patent owner in a reexamination proceeding who is 
dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and 
Interferences may, subject to Sec. 1.979(e), appeal to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellant must take the following 
steps in such an appeal:
    (1) In the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office, file a timely written 
notice of appeal directed to the Commissioner in accordance with 
Secs. 1.302 and 1.304; and
    (2) In the Court, file a copy of the notice of appeal and pay the 
fee, as provided for in the rules of the Court.

      Concurrent Proceedings Involving Same Patent in Inter Partes 
                              Reexamination


<R05>
Sec. 1.985  Notification of prior or concurrent proceedings in inter partes reexamination.

    (a) In any inter partes reexamination proceeding, the patent owner 
shall call the attention of the Office to any prior or concurrent 
proceedings in which the patent is or was involved, including but not 
limited to interference, reissue, reexamination, or litigation and the 
results of such proceedings.
    (b) Notwithstanding any provision of the rules, any person at any 
time may file a paper in an inter partes reexamination proceeding 
notifying the Office of a prior or concurrent proceedings in which the 
same patent is or was involved, including but not limited to 
interference, reissue, reexamination, or litigation and the results of 
such proceedings. Such paper must be limited to merely providing notice 
of the other proceeding without discussion of issues of the current 
inter partes reexamination proceeding. Any paper not so limited will be 
returned to the sender.


<R05>
Sec. 1.987  Suspension of inter partes reexamination proceeding due to litigation.

    If a patent in the process of inter partes reexamination is or 
becomes involved in litigation, the Commissioner shall determine whether 
or not to suspend the inter partes reexamination proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 1.989  Merger of concurrent reexamination proceedings.

    (a) If any reexamination is ordered while a prior inter partes 
reexamination proceeding is pending for the same patent and prosecution 
in the prior inter partes reexamination proceeding has not been 
terminated, a decision may be made to merge the two proceedings or to 
suspend one of the two proceedings. Where merger is ordered, the merged 
examination will normally result in the issuance of a single 
reexamination certificate under Sec. 1.997.
    (b) An inter partes reexamination proceeding filed under Sec. 1.913 
which is merged with an ex parte reexamination proceeding filed under 
Sec. 1.510 will result

[[Page 222]]

in the merged proceeding being governed by Secs. 1.902 through 1.997, 
except that the rights of any third party requester of the ex parte 
reexamination shall be governed by Secs. 1.510 through 1.560.


<R05>
Sec. 1.991  Merger of concurrent reissue application and inter partes reexamination proceeding.

    If a reissue application and an inter partes reexamination 
proceeding on which an order pursuant to Sec. 1.931 has been mailed are 
pending concurrently on a patent, a decision may be made to merge the 
two proceedings or to suspend one of the two proceedings. Where merger 
of a reissue application and an inter partes reexamination proceeding is 
ordered, the merged proceeding will be conducted in accordance with 
Secs. 1.171 through 1.179, and the patent owner will be required to 
place and maintain the same claims in the reissue application and the 
inter partes reexamination proceeding during the pendency of the merged 
proceeding. In a merged proceeding the third party requester may 
participate to the extent provided under Secs. 1.902 through 1.997, 
except that such participation shall be limited to issues within the 
scope of inter partes reexamination. The examiner's actions and any 
responses by the patent owner or third party requester in a merged 
proceeding will apply to both the reissue application and the inter 
partes reexamination proceeding and be physically entered into both 
files. Any inter partes reexamination proceeding merged with a reissue 
application shall be terminated by the grant of the reissued patent.


<R05>
Sec. 1.993  Suspension of concurrent interference and inter partes reexamination proceeding.

    If a patent in the process of inter partes reexamination is or 
becomes involved in an interference, the Commissioner may suspend the 
inter partes reexamination or the interference. The Commissioner will 
not consider a request to suspend an interference unless a motion under 
Sec. 1.635 to suspend the interference has been presented to, and denied 
by, an administrative patent judge and the request is filed within ten 
(10) days of a decision by an administrative patent judge denying the 
motion for suspension or such other time as the administrative patent 
judge may set.


<R05>
Sec. 1.995  Third party requester's participation rights preserved in merged proceeding.

    When a third party requester is involved in one or more proceedings, 
including an inter partes reexamination proceeding, the merger of such 
proceedings will be accomplished so as to preserve the third party 
requester's right to participate to the extent specifically provided for 
in these regulations. In merged proceedings involving different 
requesters, any paper filed by one party in the merged proceeding shall 
be served on all other parties of the merged proceeding.

         Reexamination Certificate in Inter Partes Reexamination


<R05>
Sec. 1.997  Issuance of inter partes reexamination certificate.

    (a) Upon the conclusion of an inter partes reexamination proceeding, 
the Commissioner will issue a certificate in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 
316 setting forth the results of the inter partes reexamination 
proceeding and the content of the patent following the inter partes 
reexamination proceeding.
    (b) A certificate will be issued in each patent in which an inter 
partes reexamination proceeding has been ordered under Sec. 1.931. Any 
statutory disclaimer filed by the patent owner will be made part of the 
certificate.
    (c) The certificate will be sent to the patent owner at the address 
as provided for in Sec. 1.33(c). A copy of the certificate will also be 
sent to the third party requester of the inter partes reexamination 
proceeding.
    (d) If a certificate has been issued which cancels all of the claims 
of the patent, no further Office proceedings will be conducted with that 
patent or any reissue applications or any reexamination requests 
relating thereto.
    (e) If the inter partes reexamination proceeding is terminated by 
the grant of a reissued patent as provided in Sec. 1.991, the reissued 
patent will constitute the reexamination certificate required by this 
section and 35 U.S.C. 316.

[[Page 223]]

    (f) A notice of the issuance of each certificate under this section 
will be published in the Official Gazette.

                       Requirements for Recording


<R05>
Sec. 3.21  Identification of patents and patent applications.

    An assignment relating to a patent must identify the patent by the 
patent number. An assignment relating to a national patent application 
must identify the national patent application by the application number 
(consisting of the series code and the serial number, e.g., 07/123,456). 
An assignment relating to an international patent application which 
designates the United States of America must identify the international 
application by the international application number (e.g., PCT/US90/
01234). If an assignment of a patent application filed under 
Sec. 1.53(b) is executed concurrently with, or subsequent to, the 
execution of the patent application, but before the patent application 
is filed, it must identify the patent application by its date of 
execution, name of each inventor, and title of the invention so that 
there can be no mistake as to the patent application intended. If an 
assignment of a provisional application under Sec. 1.53(c) is executed 
before the provisional application is filed, it must identify the 
provisional application by name of each inventor and title of the 
invention so that there can be no mistake as to the provisional 
application intended.

<R05>
Sec. 3.28  Requests for recording.

    Each document submitted to the Office for recording must include at 
least one cover sheet as specified in Sec. 3.31 referring either to 
those patent applications and patents, or to those trademark 
applications and registrations, against which the document is to be 
recorded. If a document to be recorded includes interests in, or 
transactions involving, both patents and trademarks, separate patent and 
trademark cover sheets should be submitted. Only one set of documents 
and cover sheets to be recorded should be filed. If a document to be 
recorded is not accompanied by a completed cover sheet, the document and 
the incomplete cover sheet will be returned pursuant to Sec. 3.51 for 
proper completion. The document and a completed cover sheet should be 
resubmitted.

                        Cover Sheet Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 3.31  Cover sheet content.

    (a) Each patent or trademark cover sheet required by Sec. 3.28 must 
contain:
    (1) The name of the party conveying the interest;
    (2) The name and address of the party receiving the interest;
    (3) A description of the interest conveyed or transaction to be 
recorded;
    (4) Identification of the interests involved:
    (i) For trademark assignments and trademark name changes: Each 
trademark registration number and each trademark application number, if 
known, against which the Office is to record the document. If the 
trademark application number is not known, a copy of the application or 
a reproduction of the trademark must be submitted, along with an 
estimate of the date that the Office received the application; or
    (ii) For any other document affecting title to a trademark or patent 
application, registration or patent: Each trademark or patent 
application number or each trademark registration number or patent 
against which the document is to be recorded, or an indication that the 
document is filed together with a patent application;
    (5) The name and address of the party to whom correspondence 
concerning the request to record the document should be mailed;
    (6) The date the document was executed;
    (7) An indication that the assignee of a trademark application or 
registration who is not domiciled in the United States has designated a 
domestic representative (see Sec. 3.61); and
    (8) The signature of the party submitting the document.
    (b) A cover sheet should not refer to both patents and trademarks, 
since any information, including information about pending patent 
applications, submitted with a request for recordation of a document 
against a trademark application or trademark registration will become

Sec. 3.34  Correction of cover sheet errors.

    (a) An error in a cover sheet recorded pursuant to Sec. 3.11 will be 
corrected only if:
    (1) The error is apparent when the cover sheet is compared with the 
recorded document to which it pertains, and
    (2) A corrected cover sheet is filed for recordation.
    (b) The corrected cover sheet must be accompanied by the originally 
recorded document or a copy of the originally recorded document and by 
the recording fee as set forth in Sec. 3.41.

                                  Fees


<R05>
Sec. 3.41  Recording fees.

    (a) All requests to record documents must be accompanied by the 
appropriate fee. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
fee is required for each application, patent and registration against 
which the document is recorded as identified in the cover sheet. The 
recording fee is set in Sec. 1.21(h) of this chapter for patents and in 
Sec. 2.6(b)(6) of this chapter for trademarks.
    (b) No fee is required for each patent application and patent 
against which a document required by Executive Order 9424 is to be filed 
if:
    (1) The document does not affect title and is so identified in the 
cover sheet (see Sec. 3.31(c)(2)); and
    (2) The document and cover sheet are mailed to the Office in 
compliance with Sec. 3.27(b).

[63 FR 52159, Sept. 30, 1998]

                      Date and Effect of Recording


<R05>
Sec. 3.51  Recording date.

    The date of recording of a document is the date the document meeting 
the requirements for recording set forth in this part is filed in the 
Office. A document which does not comply with the identification 
requirements of Sec. 3.21 will not be recorded. Documents not meeting 
the other requirements for recording, for example, a document submitted 
without a completed cover sheet or without the required fee, will be 
returned for correction to the sender where a correspondence address is 
available. The returned papers, stamped with the original date of 
receipt by the Office, will be accompanied by a letter which will 
indicate that if the returned papers are corrected and resubmitted to 
the Office within the time specified in the letter, the Office will 
consider the original date of filing of the papers as the date of 
recording of the document. The procedure set forth in Sec. 1.8 or 
Sec. 1.10 of this chapter may be used for resubmissions of returned 
papers to have the benefit of the date of deposit in the United States 
Postal Service. If the returned papers are not corrected and resubmitted 
within the specified period, the date of filing of the corrected papers 
will be considered to be the date of recording of the document. The 
specified period to resubmit the returned papers will not be extended.

[62 FR 53203, Oct. 10, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 3.54  Effect of recording.

    The recording of a document pursuant to Sec. 3.11 is not a 
determination by the Office of the validity of the document or the 
effect that document has on the title to an application, a patent, or a 
registration. When necessary, the Office will determine what effect a 
document has, including whether a party has the authority to take an 
action in a matter pending before the Office.


<R05>
Sec. 3.56  Conditional assignments.

    Assignments which are made conditional on the performance of certain 
acts or events, such as the payment of money or other condition 
subsequent, if recorded in the Office, are regarded as absolute 
assignments for Office purposes until cancelled with the written consent 
of all parties or by the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
The Office does not determine whether such conditions have been 
fulfilled.


<R05>
Sec. 3.58  Governmental registers.

    (a) The Office will maintain a Departmental Register to record 
governmental interests required to be recorded by Executive Order 9424. 
This Departmental Register will not be open to public inspection but 
will be available for examination and inspection by duly authorized 
representatives of the Government. Governmental interests

[[Page 227]]

recorded on the Departmental Register will be available for public 
inspection as provided in Sec. 1.12.
    (b) The Office will maintain a Secret Register to record 
governmental interests required to be recorded by Executive Order 9424. 
Any instrument to be recorded will be placed on this Secret Register at 
the request of the department or agency submitting the same. No 
information will be given concerning any instrument in such record or 
register, and no examination or inspection thereof or of the index 
thereto will be permitted, except on the written authority of the head 
of the department or agency which submitted the instrument and requested 
secrecy, and the approval of such authority by the Commissioner of 
Patents and Trademarks. No instrument or record other than the one 
specified may be examined, and the examination must take place in the 
presence of a designated official of the Patent and Trademark Office. 
When the department or agency which submitted an instrument no longer 
requires secrecy with respect to that instrument, it must be recorded 
anew in the Departmental Register.

                         Domestic Representative


<R05>
Sec. 3.61  Domestic representative.

    If the assignee of a trademark application or registration is not 
domiciled in the United States, the assignee must designate, in writing 
to the Office, a domestic representative. An assignee of a patent 
application or patent may designate a domestic representative if the 
assignee is not residing in the United States. The designation shall 
state the name and address of a person residing within the United States 
on whom may be served process or notice of proceedings affecting the 
application, patent or registration or rights thereunder.

                        Action Taken by Assignee


<R05>
Sec. 3.71  Prosecution by assignee.

    (a) Patents--conducting of prosecution. One or more assignees as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section may, after becoming of record 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, conduct prosecution of a 
national patent application or a reexamination proceeding to the 
exclusion of either the inventive entity, or the assignee(s) previously 
entitled to conduct prosecution.
    (b) Patents--Assignee(s) who can prosecute. The assignee(s) who may 
conduct either the prosecution of a national application for patent or a 
reexamination proceeding are:
    (1) A single assignee. An assignee of the entire right, title and 
interest in the application or patent being reexamined who is of record, 
or
    (2) Partial assignee(s) together or with inventor(s). All partial 
assignees, or all partial assignees and inventors who have not assigned 
their right, title and interest in the application or patent being 
reexamined, who together own the entire right, title and interest in the 
application or patent being reexamined. A partial assignee is any 
assignee of record having less than the entire right, title and interest 
in the application or patent being reexamined.
    (c) Patents--Becoming of record. An assignee becomes of record 
either in a national patent application or a reexamination proceeding by 
filing a statement in compliance with Sec. 3.73(b) that is signed by a 
party who is authorized to act on behalf of the assignee.
    (d) Trademarks. The assignee of a trademark application or 
registration may prosecute a trademark application, submit documents to 
maintain a trademark registration, or file papers against a third party 
in reliance on the assignee's trademark application or registration, to 
the exclusion of the original applicant or previous assignee. The 
assignee must establish ownership in compliance with Sec. 3.73(b).

[65 FR 54682, Sept. 8, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 3.73  Establishing right of assignee to take action.

    (a) The inventor is presumed to be the owner of a patent 
application, and any patent that may issue therefrom, unless there is an 
assignment. The original applicant is presumed to be the owner of a 
trademark application or registration, unless there is an assignment.
    (b)(1) In order to request or take action in a patent or trademark 
matter,

[[Page 228]]

the assignee must establish its ownership of the patent or trademark 
property of paragraph (a) of this section to the satisfaction of the 
Commissioner. The establishment of ownership by the assignee may be 
combined with the paper that requests or takes the action. Ownership is 
established by submitting to the Office a signed statement identifying 
the assignee, accompanied by either:
    (i) Documentary evidence of a chain of title from the original owner 
to the assignee (e.g., copy of an executed assignment). The documents 
submitted to establish ownership may be required to be recorded pursuant 
to Sec. 3.11 in the assignment records of the Office as a condition to 
permitting the assignee to take action in a matter pending before the 
Office; or
    (ii) A statement specifying where documentary evidence of a chain of 
title from the original owner to the assignee is recorded in the 
assignment records of the Office (e.g., reel and frame number).
    (2) The submission establishing ownership must show that the person 
signing the submission is a person authorized to act on behalf of the 
assignee by:
    (i) Including a statement that the person signing the submission is 
authorized to act on behalf of the assignee; or
    (ii) Being signed by a person having apparent authority to sign on 
behalf of the assignee, e.g., an officer of the assignee.
    (c) For patent matters only:
    (1) Establishment of ownership by the assignee must be submitted 
prior to, or at the same time as, the paper requesting or taking action 
is submitted.
    (2) If the submission under this section is by an assignee of less 
than the entire right, title and interest, such assignee must indicate 
the extent (by percentage) of its ownership interest, or the Office may 
refuse to accept the submission as an establishment of ownership.

<R05>
Sec. 3.81  Issue of patent to assignee.

    (a) With payment of the issue fee: An application may issue in the 
name(s) of the assignee(s) consistent with the application's assignment 
where a request for such issuance is submitted with payment of the issue 
fee, provided the assignment has been previously recorded in the Office. 
If the assignment has not been previously recorded, the request should 
be accompanied by the assignment and either a direction to record the 
assignment in the Office pursuant to Sec. 3.28, or a statement under 
Sec. 3.73(b).
    (b) After payment of the issue fee: An application may issue in the 
name(s) of the assignee(s) consistent with the application's assignment 
where a request for such issuance along with the processing fee set 
forth in Sec. 1.17(i) of this chapter is submitted after the date of 
payment of the issue fee, but prior to issuance of the patent, provided 
the assignment has been previously recorded in the Office. If the 
assignment has not been previously recorded, the request should be 
accompanied by the assignment and either a direction to record the 
assignment in the Office pursuant to Sec. 3.28, or a statement under 
Sec. 3.73(b).
    (c) Partial assignees. (1) If one or more assignee(s) together with 
one or more inventor(s) hold the entire right, title, and interest in 
the application, the patent may issue in the names of the assignee(s) 
and the inventor(s).
    (2) If multiple assignees hold the entire right, title, and interest 
to the exclusion of all the inventors, the patent may issue in the names 
of the multiple assignees.

[65 FR 54682, Sept. 8, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 3.85  Issue of registration to assignee.

    The certificate of registration may be issued to the assignee of the 
applicant, or in a new name of the applicant, provided that the party 
files a written request in the trademark application by the time the 
application is being prepared for issuance of the certificate of 
registration, and the appropriate document is recorded in the Office. If 
the assignment or name change

    (5) Any party who directly engages in the business of retail sales 
of products or the distribution of products.
    (b) Customer means any individual who enters into a contract with an 
invention promoter for invention promotion services.
    (c) Contract for Invention Promotion Services means a contract by 
which an invention promoter undertakes invention promotion services for 
a customer.
    (d) Invention Promotion Services means the procurement or attempted 
procurement for a customer of a firm, corporation, or other entity to 
develop and market products or services that include the invention of 
the customer.


<R05>
Sec. 4.3  Submitting complaints.

    (a) A person may submit a complaint concerning an invention promoter 
with the Office. A person submitting a complaint should understand that 
the complaint may be forwarded to the invention promoter and may become 
publicly available. The Office will not accept any complaint that 
requests that it be kept confidential.
    (b) A complaint must be clearly marked, or otherwise identified, as 
a complaint under these rules. The complaint must include:
    (1) The name and address of the complainant;
    (2) The name and address of the invention promoter;
    (3) The name of the customer;
    (4) The invention promotion services offered or performed by the 
invention promoter;
    (5) The name of the mass media in which the invention promoter 
advertised providing such services;
    (6) An explanation of the relationship between the customer and the 
invention promoter; and
    (7) A signature of the complainant.

[[Page 230]]

    (c) The complaint should fairly summarize the action of the 
invention promoter about which the person complains. Additionally, the 
complaint should include names and addresses of persons believed to be 
associated with the invention promoter. Complaints, and any replies, 
must be addressed to Office of Independent Inventor Programs, U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.
    (d) Complaints that do not provide the information requested in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will be returned. If 
complainant's address is not provided, the complaint will be destroyed.
    (e) No originals of documents should be included with the complaint.
    (f) A complaint can be withdrawn by the complainant or the named 
customer at any time prior to its publication.


<R05>
Sec. 4.4  Invention promoter reply.

    (a) If a submission appears to meet the requirements of a complaint, 
the invention promoter named in the complaint will be notified of the 
complaint and given 30 days to respond. The invention promoter's 
response will be made available to the public along with the complaint. 
If the invention promoter fails to reply within the 30-day time period 
set by the Office, the complaint will be made available to the public. 
Replies sent after the complaint is made available to the public will 
also be published.
    (b) A response must be clearly marked, or otherwise identified, as a 
response by an invention promoter. The response must contain:
    (1) The name and address of the invention promoter;
    (2) A reference to a complaint forwarded to the invention promoter 
or a complaint previously published;
    (3) The name of the individual signing the response; and
    (4) The title or authority of the individual signing the response.


<R05>
Sec. 4.5  Notice by publication.

    If the copy of the complaint that is mailed to the invention 
promoter is returned undelivered, then the Office will publish a Notice 
of Complaint Received in the Official Gazette, the Federal Register, or 
on the Office's Internet home page. The invention promoter will be given 
30 days from such notice to submit a reply to the complaint. If the 
Office does not receive a reply from the invention promoter within 30 
days, the complaint alone will become publicly available.


<R05>
Sec. 4.6  Attorneys and agents.

    Complaints against registered patent attorneys and agents will not 
be treated under this section, unless a complaint fairly demonstrates 
that invention promotion services are involved. Persons having 
complaints about registered patent attorneys or agents should contact 
the Office of Enrollment and Discipline at the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office, Box OED, Washington, D.C. 20231, and the attorney discipline 
section of the attorney's state licensing bar if an attorney is 
involved.

                             Secrecy Orders


<R05>
Sec. 5.1  Applications and correspondence involving national security.

    (a) All correspondence in connection with this part, including 
petitions, should be addressed to ``Commissioner for Patents (Attention 
Licensing and Review), Washington, D.C. 20231.''
    (b) Application as used in this part includes provisional 
applications filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(b) (Sec. 1.9(a)(2) of this 
chapter), nonprovisional applications filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) or 
entering the national stage from an international application after 
compliance with 35 U.S.C. 371 (Sec. 1.9(a)(3)), or international 
applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty prior to entering 
the national stage of processing (Sec. 1.9(b)).
    (c) Patent applications and documents relating thereto that are 
national security classified (see Sec. 1.9(i) of this chapter) and 
contain authorized national security markings (e.g., ``Confidential,'' 
``Secret'' or ``Top Secret'') are accepted by the Office. National 
security classified documents filed in the Office must be either hand-
carried to Licensing and Review or mailed to the Office in compliance 
with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) The applicant in a national security classified patent 
application must obtain a secrecy order pursuant to Sec. 5.2(a). If a 
national security classified patent application is filed without a 
notification pursuant to Sec. 5.2(a), the Office will set a time period 
within which either the application must be declassified, or the 
application must be placed under a secrecy order pursuant to 
Sec. 5.2(a), or the applicant must submit evidence of a good faith 
effort to obtain a secrecy order pursuant to Sec. 5.2(a) from the 
relevant department or agency in order to prevent abandonment of the 
application. If evidence of a good faith effort to obtain a secrecy 
order pursuant to Sec. 5.2(a) from the relevant department or agency is 
submitted by the applicant within the time period set by the Office, but 
the application has not been declassified or placed under a secrecy 
order pursuant to Sec. 5.2(a), the Office will again set a time period 
within which either the application must be declassified, or the 
application must be placed under a secrecy order pursuant to 
Sec. 5.2(a), or the applicant must submit evidence of a good faith 
effort to again obtain a secrecy order pursuant to Sec. 5.2(a) from the 
relevant department or agency in order to prevent abandonment of the 
application.
    (e) An application will not be published under Sec. 1.211 of this 
chapter or allowed under Sec. 1.311 of this chapter if publication or 
disclosure of the application would be detrimental to national security. 
An application under national security review will not be published at 
least until six months from its filing date or three months from the 
date the application was referred to a defense agency, whichever is 
later. A national security classified patent application will not be 
published under Sec. 1.211 of this chapter or allowed under Sec. 1.311 
of this chapter until the application is declassified and any secrecy 
order under Sec. 5.2(a) has been rescinded.
    (f) Applications on inventions made outside the United States and on 
inventions in which a U.S. Government defense agency has a property 
interest will not be made available to defense agencies.

[65 FR 54682, Sept. 8, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 57060, Sept. 20, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 5.2  Secrecy order.

    (a) When notified by the chief officer of a defense agency that 
publication or disclosure of the invention by the granting of a patent 
would be detrimental to the national security, an order that the 
invention be kept secret will be issued by the Commissioner of Patents 
and Trademarks.

[[Page 232]]

    (b) Any request for compensation as provided in 35 U.S.C. 183 must 
not be made to the Patent and Trademark Office, but directly to the 
department or agency which caused the secrecy order to be issued.
    (c) An application disclosing any significant part of the subject 
matter of an application under a secrecy order pursuant to paragraph (a) 
of this section also falls within the scope of such secrecy order. Any 
such application that is pending before the Office must be promptly 
brought to the attention of Licensing and Review, unless such 
application is itself under a secrecy order pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this section. Any subsequently filed application containing any 
significant part of the subject matter of an application under a secrecy 
order pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must either be hand-
carried to Licensing and Review or mailed to the Office in compliance 
with Sec. 5.1(a).

[24 FR 10381, Dec. 22, 1959, as amended at 62 FR 53203, Oct. 10, 1997; 
65 FR 54683, Sept. 8, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 5.3  Prosecution of application under secrecy orders; withholding patent.

    Unless specifically ordered otherwise, action on the application by 
the Office and prosecution by the applicant will proceed during the time 
an application is under secrecy order to the point indicated in this 
section:
    (a) National applications under secrecy order which come to a final 
rejection must be appealed or otherwise prosecuted to avoid abandonment. 
Appeals in such cases must be completed by the applicant but unless 
otherwise specifically ordered by the Commissioner will not be set for 
hearing until the secrecy order is removed.
    (b) An interference will not be declared involving national 
applications under secrecy order. However, if an applicant whose 
application is under secrecy order seeks to provoke an interference with 
an issued patent, a notice of that fact will be placed in the file 
wrapper of the patent. (See Sec. 1.607(d))
    (c) When the national application is found to be in condition for 
allowance except for the secrecy order the applicant and the agency 
which caused the secrecy order to be issued will be notified. This 
notice (which is not a notice of allowance under Sec. 1.311 of this 
chapter) does not require reply by the applicant and places the national 
application in a condition of suspension until the secrecy order is 
removed. When the secrecy order is removed the Patent and Trademark 
Office will issue a notice of allowance under Sec. 1.311 of this 
chapter, or take such other action as may then be warranted.
    (d) International applications under secrecy order will not be 
mailed, delivered or otherwise transmitted to the international 
authorities or the applicant. International applications under secrecy 
order will be processed up to the point where, if it were not for the

Sec. 5.4  Petition for rescission of secrecy order.

    (a) A petition for rescission or removal of a secrecy order may be 
filed by, or on behalf of, any principal affected thereby. Such petition 
may be in letter form, and it must be in duplicate.
    (b) The petition must recite any and all facts that purport to 
render the order ineffectual or futile if this is the basis of the 
petition. When prior publications or patents are alleged the petition 
must give complete data as to such publications or patents and should be 
accompanied by copies thereof.
    (c) The petition must identify any contract between the Government 
and any of the principals, under which the subject matter of the 
application or any significant part thereof was developed, or to which 
the subject matter is otherwise related. If there is no such contract, 
the petition must so state.
    (d) Appeal to the Secretary of Commerce, as provided by 35 U.S.C. 
181, from a secrecy order cannot be taken until after a petition for 
rescission of the secrecy order has been made and denied. Appeal must be 
taken within sixty days from the date of the denial, and the party 
appealing, as well as the

[[Page 233]]

department or agency which caused the order to be issued, will be 
notified of the time and place of hearing.

Sec. 5.5  Permit to disclose or modification of secrecy order.

    (a) Consent to disclosure, or to the filing of an application 
abroad, as provided in 35 U.S.C. 182, shall be made by a ``permit'' or 
``modification'' of the secrecy order.
    (b) Petitions for a permit or modification must fully recite the 
reason or purpose for the proposed disclosure. Where any proposed 
disclosee is known to be cleared by a defense agency to receive 
classified information, adequate explanation of such clearance should be 
made in the petition including the name of the agency or department 
granting the clearance and the date and degree thereof. The petition 
must be filed in duplicate.
    (c) In a petition for modification of a secrecy order to permit 
filing abroad, all countries in which it is proposed to file must be 
made known, as well as all attorneys, agents and others to whom the 
material will be consigned prior to being lodged in the foreign patent 
office. The petition should include a statement vouching for the loyalty 
and integrity of the proposed disclosees and where their clearance 
status in this or the foreign country is known all details should be 
given.
    (d) Consent to the disclosure of subject matter from one application 
under secrecy order may be deemed to be consent to the disclosure of 
common subject matter in other applications under secrecy order so long 
as not taken out of context in a manner disclosing material beyond the 
modification granted in the first application.
    (e) Organizations requiring consent for disclosure of applications 
under secrecy order to persons or organizations in connection with 
repeated routine operation may petition for such consent in the form of 
a general permit. To be successful such petitions must ordinarily recite 
the security clearance status of the disclosees as sufficient for the 
highest classification of material that may be involved.

Secs. 5.6-5.8  [Reserved]

                Licenses for Foreign Exporting and Filing


<R05>
Sec. 5.11  License for filing in a foreign country an application on an invention made in the United States or for transmitting an international application.

    (a) A license from the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks under 
35 U.S.C. 184 is required before filing any application for patent 
including any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto or 
divisions thereof or for the registration of a utility model, industrial 
design, or model, in a foreign patent office or any foreign patent 
agency or any international agency other than the United States 
Receiving Office, if the invention was made in the United States and:
    (1) An application on the invention has been on file in the United 
States less than six months prior to the date on which the application 
is to be filed, or
    (2) No application on the invention has been filed in the United 
States.
    (b) The license from the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks 
referred to in paragraph (a) would also authorize the export of 
technical data abroad for purposes relating to the preparation, filing 
or possible filing and prosecution of a foreign patent application 
without separately complying with the regulations contained in 22 CFR 
parts 121 through 130 (International Traffic in Arms Regulations of the 
Department of State), 15 CFR part 779 (Regulations of the Office of 
Export Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of 
Commerce) and 10 CFR part 810 (Foreign Atomic Energy Programs of the 
Department of Energy).
    (c) Where technical data in the form of a patent application, or in 
any form, is being exported for purposes related to the preparation, 
filing or possible filing and prosecution of a foreign patent 
application, without the license from the Commissioner of Patents and

[[Page 234]]

Trademarks referred to in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, or on 
an invention not made in the United States, the export regulations 
contained in 22 CFR parts 120 through 130 (International Traffic in Arms 
Regulations of the Department of State), 15 CFR parts 768-799 (Export 
Administration Regulations of the Department of Commerce) and 10 CFR 
part 810 (Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities Regulations of 
the Department of Energy) must be complied with unless a license is not 
required because a United States application was on file at the time of 
export for at least six months without a secrecy order under Sec. 5.2 
being placed thereon. The term ``exported'' means export as it is 
defined in 22 CFR part 120, 15 CFR part 779 and activities covered by 10 
CFR part 810.
    (d) If a secrecy order has been issued under Sec. 5.2, an 
application cannot be exported to, or filed in, a foreign country 
(including an international agency in a foreign country), except in 
accordance with Sec. 5.5.
    (e) No license pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is 
required:
    (1) If the invention was not made in the United States, or
    (2) If the corresponding United States application is not subject to 
a secrecy order under Sec. 5.2, and was filed at least six months prior 
to the date on which the application is filed in a foreign country, or
    (3) For subsequent modifications, amendments and supplements 
containing additional subject matter to, or divisions of, a foreign 
patent application if:
    (i) A license is not, or was not, required under paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section for the foreign patent application;
    (ii) The corresponding United States application was not required to 
be made available for inspection under 35 U.S.C. 181; and
    (iii) Such modifications, amendments, and supplements do not, or did 
not, change the general nature of the invention in a manner which would 
require any corresponding United States application to be or have been 
available for inspection under 35 U.S.C. 181.
    (f) A license pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section can be 
revoked at any time upon written notification by the Patent and 
Trademark Office. An authorization to file a foreign patent application 
resulting from the passage of six months from the date of filing of a 
United States patent application may be revoked by the imposition of a 
secrecy order.

<R05>
Sec. 5.12  Petition for license.

    (a) Filing of an application for patent for inventions made in the 
United States will be considered to include a petition for license under 
35 U.S.C. 184 for the subject matter of the application. The filing 
receipt will indicate if a license is granted. If the initial automatic 
petition is not granted, a subsequent petition may be filed under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) A petition for license must include the fee set forth in 
Sec. 1.17(h) of this chapter, the petitioner's address, and full 
instructions for delivery of the requested license when it is to be 
delivered to other than the petitioner. The petition should be presented 
in letter form.

<R05>
Sec. 5.13  Petition for license; no corresponding application.

    If no corresponding national or international application has been 
filed in the United States, the petition for license under Sec. 5.12(b) 
must also be accompanied by a legible copy of the material upon which a 
license is desired. This copy will be retained as a measure of the 
license granted.

[62 FR 53204, Oct. 10, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 5.14  Petition for license; corresponding U.S. application.

    (a) When there is a corresponding United States application on file, 
a petition for license under Sec. 5.12(b) must also identify this 
application by application number, filing date, inventor, and title, but 
a copy of the material upon which the license is desired is not 
required. The subject matter licensed

[[Page 235]]

will be measured by the disclosure of the United States application.
    (b) Two or more United States applications should not be referred to 
in the same petition for license unless they are to be combined in the 
foreign or international application, in which event the petition should 
so state and the identification of each United States application should 
be in separate paragraphs.
    (c) When the application to be filed or exported abroad contains 
matter not disclosed in the United States application or applications, 
including the case where the combining of two or more United States 
applications introduces subject matter not disclosed in any of them, a 
copy of the application as it is to be filed in the foreign country or 
international application which is to be transmitted to a foreign 
international or national agency for filing in the Receiving Office, 
must be furnished with the petition. If however, all new matter in the 
foreign or international application to be filed is readily 
identifiable, the new matter may be submitted in detail and the 
remainder by reference to the pertinent United States application or 
applications.

<R05>
Sec. 5.15  Scope of license.

    (a) Applications or other materials reviewed pursuant to Secs. 5.12 
through 5.14, which were not required to be made available for 
inspection by defense agencies under 35 U.S.C. 181, will be eligible for 
a license of the scope provided in this paragraph. This license permits 
subsequent modifications, amendments, and supplements containing 
additional subject matter to, or divisions of, a foreign patent 
application, if such changes to the application do not alter the general 
nature of the invention in a manner which would require the United 
States application to have been made available for inspection under 35 
U.S.C. 181. Grant of this license authorizing the export and filing of 
an application in a foreign country or the transmitting of an 
international application to any foreign patent agency or international 
patent agency when the subject matter of the foreign or international 
application corresponds to that of the domestic application. This 
license includes authority:
    (1) To export and file all duplicate and formal application papers 
in foreign countries or with international agencies;
    (2) To make amendments, modifications, and supplements, including 
divisions, changes or supporting matter consisting of the illustration, 
exemplification, comparison, or explanation of subject matter disclosed 
in the application; and
    (3) To take any action in the prosecution of the foreign or 
international application provided that the adding of subject matter or 
taking of any action under paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section does 
not change the general nature of the invention disclosed in the 
application in a manner which would require such application to have 
been made available for inspection under 35 U.S.C. 181 by including 
technical data pertaining to:
    (i) Defense services or articles designated in the United States 
Munitions List applicable at the time of foreign filing, the unlicensed 
exportation of which is prohibited pursuant to the Arms Export Control 
Act, as amended, and 22 CFR parts 121 through 130; or
    (ii) Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear technology or technology 
useful in the production or utilization of special nuclear material or 
atomic energy, dissemination of which is subject to restrictions of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Act of 1978, as implemented by the regulations for Unclassified 
Activities in Foreign Atomic Energy Programs, 10 CFR part 810, in effect 
at the time of foreign filing.
    (b) Applications or other materials which were required to be made 
available for inspection under 35 U.S.C. 181 will be eligible for a 
license of the scope provided in this paragraph. Grant of this license 
authorizes the export and filing of an application in a foreign country 
or the transmitting of an international application to any foreign 
patent agency or international patent agency. Further, this license 
includes authority to export and file all

[[Page 236]]

duplicate and formal papers in foreign countries or with foreign and 
international patent agencies and to make amendments, modifications, and 
supplements to, file divisions of, and take any action in the 
prosecution of the foreign or international application, provided 
subject matter additional to that covered by the license is not 
involved.
    (c) A license granted under Sec. 5.12(b) pursuant to Sec. 5.13 or 
Sec. 5.14 shall have the scope indicated in paragraph (a) of this 
section, if it is so specified in the license. A petition, accompanied 
by the required fee (Sec. 1.17(h)), may also be filed to change a 
license having the scope indicated in paragraph (b) of this section to a 
license having the scope indicated in paragraph (a) of this section. No 
such petition will be granted if the copy of the material filed pursuant 
to Sec. 5.13 or any corresponding United States application was required 
to be made available for inspection under 35 U.S.C. 181. The change in 
the scope of a license will be effective as of the date of the grant of 
the petition.
    (d) In those cases in which no license is required to file the 
foreign application or transmit the international application, no 
license is required to file papers in connection with the prosecution of 
the foreign or international application not involving the disclosure of 
additional subject matter.
    (e) Any paper filed abroad or transmitted to an international patent 
agency following the filing of a foreign or international application 
which changes the general nature of the subject matter disclosed at the 
time of filing in a manner which would require such application to have 
been made available for inspection under 35 U.S.C. 181 or which involves 
the disclosure of subject matter listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) or (ii) 
of this section must be separately licensed in the same manner as a 
foreign or international application. Further, if no license has been 
granted under Sec. 5.12(a) on filing the corresponding United States 
application, any paper filed abroad or with an international patent 
agency which involves the disclosure of additional subject matter must 
be licensed in the same manner as a foreign or international 
application.
    (f) Licenses separately granted in connection with two or more 
United States applications may be exercised by combining or dividing the 
disclosures, as desired, provided:
    (1) Subject matter which changes the general nature of the subject 
matter disclosed at the time of filing or which involves subject matter 
listed in paragraph (a)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section is not 
introduced, and
    (2) In the case where at least one of the licenses was obtained 
under Sec. 5.12(b), additional subject matter is not introduced.
    (g) A license does not apply to acts done before the license was 
granted. See Sec. 5.25 for petitions for retroactive licenses.

Secs. 5.16-5.17  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 5.18  Arms, ammunition, and implements of war.

    (a) The exportation of technical data relating to arms, ammunition, 
and implements of war generally is subject to the International Traffic 
in Arms Regulations of the Department of State (22 CFR parts 120 through 
130); the articles designated as arms, ammunitions, and implements of 
war are enumerated in the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121). 
However, if a patent applicant complies with regulations issued by the 
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks under 35 U.S.C. 184, no separate 
approval from the Department of State is required unless the applicant 
seeks to export technical data exceeding that used to support a patent 
application in a foreign country. This exemption from Department of 
State regulations is applicable regardless of whether a license from the 
Commissioner is required by the provisions of Secs. 5.11 and 5.12 (22 
CFR part 125).
    (b) When a patent application containing subject matter on the 
Munitions List (22 CFR part 121) is subject to a secrecy order under 
Sec. 5.2 and a petition is made under Sec. 5.5 for a modification of the 
secrecy order to permit filing abroad, a separate request to the 
Department of State for authority to

[[Page 237]]

export classified information is not required (22 CFR part 125).

<R05>
Sec. 5.19  Export of technical data.

    (a) Under regulations (15 CFR 770.10(j)) established by the 
Department of Commerce, a license is not required in any case to file a 
patent application or part thereof in a foreign country if the foreign 
filing is in accordance with the regulations (Secs. 5.11 through 5.25) 
of the Patent and Trademark Office.
    (b) An export license is not required for data contained in a patent 
application prepared wholly from foreign-origin technical data where 
such application is being sent to the foreign inventor to be executed 
and returned to the United States for subsequent filing in the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office (15 CFR 779A.3(e)).

    Under regulations (10 CFR 810.7) established by the United States 
Department of Energy, an application filed in accordance with the 
regulations (Secs. 5.11 through 5.25) of the Patent and Trademark Office 
and eligible for foreign filing under 35 U.S.C. 184, is considered to be 
information available to the public in published form and a generally 
authorized activity for the purposes of the Department of Energy 
regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 5.25  Petition for retroactive license.

    (a) A petition for a retroactive license under 35 U.S.C. 184 shall 
be presented in accordance with Sec. 5.13 or Sec. 5.14(a), and shall 
include:
    (1) A listing of each of the foreign countries in which the 
unlicensed patent application material was filed,
    (2) The dates on which the material was filed in each country,
    (3) A verified statement (oath or declaration) containing:
    (i) An averment that the subject matter in question was not under a 
secrecy order at the time it was filed aboard, and that it is not 
currently under a secrecy order,
    (ii) A showing that the license has been diligently sought after 
discovery of the proscribed foreign filing, and
    (iii) An explanation of why the material was filed abroad through 
error and without deceptive intent without the required license under 
Sec. 5.11 first having been obtained, and
    (4) The required fee (Sec. 1.17(h)).

The above explanation must include a showing of facts rather than a mere 
allegation of action through error and without deceptive intent. The 
showing of facts as to the nature of the error should include statements 
by those persons having personal knowledge of the acts regarding filing 
in a foreign country and should be accompanied by copies of any 
necessary supporting documents such as letters of transmittal or 
instructions for filing. The acts which are alleged to constitute error 
without deceptive intent should cover the period leading up to and 
including each of the proscribed foreign filings.
    (b) If a petition for a retroactive license is denied, a time period 
of not less than thirty days shall be set, during which the petition may 
be renewed. Failure to renew the petition within the set time period 
will result in a final denial of the petition. A final denial of a 
petition stands unless a petition is filed under Sec. 1.181 within two 
months of the date of the denial. If the petition for a retroactive 
license is denied with respect to the invention of a pending application 
and no petition under Sec. 1.181 has been filed, a final rejection of 
the application under 35 U.S.C. 185 will be made.

filing bases:
    (1) Use in commerce under section 1(a) of the Act. The requirements 
for an application based on section 1(a) of the Act are:
    (i) The trademark owner's verified statement that the mark is in use 
in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the 
application. If the verification is not filed with the initial 
application, the verified statement must allege that the mark was in use 
in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services listed in the 
application as of the application filing date;
    (ii) The date of the applicant's first use of the mark anywhere on

as a trademark or service mark; and

in commerce.
    (v) An application may list more than one item of goods, or more 
than one service, provided the applicant has used the mark on or in

required by paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section may be for 
only one of the items specified.
    (2) Intent-to-use under section 1(b) of the Act. (i) In an

verify that it has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce on 
or in connection with the goods or services listed in the application. 
If the verification is not filed with the initial application, the 
verified statement must allege that the applicant had a bona fide 
intention to use the mark in commerce as of the filing date of the 
application.
    (ii) The application may list more than one item of goods, or more 
than one service, provided the applicant has a bona fide intention to 
use the mark in commerce on or in connection with all the specified 
goods or services.
    (3) Registration of a mark in a foreign applicant's country of

application under section 44(e) of the Act are:
    (i) The trademark owner's verified statement that it has a bona fide 
intention to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods 
or services listed in the application. If the verification is not filed 
with the initial application, the verified statement must allege that 
the applicant had a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce as 
of the filing date of the application.
    (ii) A certification or certified copy of a registration in the

in that country, and that the registration is in full force and effect. 
The certification or certified copy must show the name of the owner, the 
mark, and the goods or services for which the mark is registered. If the 
certification or certified copy is not in the English language, the 
applicant must submit a translation.
    (iii) If the record indicates that the foreign registration will 
expire before the United States registration will issue, the applicant 
must submit a certification or certified copy from the country of origin 
to establish that the registration has been renewed and will be in force 
at the time the United States registration will issue. If the 
certification or certified copy is not in the English language, the 
applicant must submit a translation.
    (iv) The application may list more than one item of goods, or more 
than one service, provided the applicant has a bona fide intention to 
use the mark in commerce on or in connection with all the specified 
goods or services.
    (4) Claim of priority, based upon an earlier-filed foreign 
application, under section 44(d) of the Act. The requirements for an 
application under section 44(d) of the Act are:
    (i) A claim of priority, filed within six months of the filing date 
of the foreign application. Before publication or

    (A) Specify the filing date and country of the first regularly filed 
foreign application; or

filed application in the same foreign country, and that any prior-filed 
application has been withdrawn, abandoned or otherwise disposed of, 
without having been laid open to public inspection and without having 
any rights outstanding, and has not served as a basis for claiming a 
right of priority.
    (ii) Include the trademark owner's verified statement that it has a 
bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with 
the goods or services listed in the application. If the verification is 
not filed with the initial application, the verified statement must 
allege that the applicant had a bona fide intention to use the mark in 
commerce as of the filing date of the application.

registration on the Supplemental Register, the applicant must establish 
a basis under section 1(a), section 1(b) or section 44(e) of the Act.

than one service, provided the applicant has a bona fide intention to 
use the mark in commerce on or in connection with all the specified 
goods or services.
    (b)(1) The applicant may claim more than one basis, provided that 
the applicant satisfies all requirements for the bases claimed. However, 
the applicant may not claim both sections 1(a) and 1(b) for the 
identical goods or services in the same application.
    (2) If the applicant claims more than one basis, the applicant must 
list each basis, followed by the goods or services to which that basis 
applies. If some or all of the goods or services are covered by more 
than one basis, this must be stated.
    (c) The word ``commerce'' means commerce that Congress may lawfully 
regulate, as specified in section 45 of the Act.

[64 FR 48919, Sept. 8, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 2.35  Adding, deleting, or substituting bases.

    (a) Before publication, the applicant may add or substitute a basis, 
if the applicant meets all requirements for the new basis, as stated in 
Sec. 2.34. The applicant may delete a basis at any time.
    (b) An applicant may amend an application that is not the subject of 
an inter partes proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board 
to add or substitute a basis after the mark has been published for 
opposition, but only with the express permission of the Commissioner, 
after consideration on petition. Republication will be required. The 
amendment of an application that is the subject of an inter partes 
proceeding before the Board is governed by Sec. 2.133(a).
    (c) When the applicant substitutes one basis for another, the Office 
will presume that there was a continuing valid basis, unless there is 
contradictory evidence in the record, and the application will retain 
the original filing date, including a priority filing date under section 
44(d), if appropriate.
    (d) If an applicant properly claims a section 44(d) basis in 
addition to another basis, the applicant will retain the priority filing 
date under section 44(d) no matter which basis the applicant perfects.
    (e) The applicant may add or substitute a section 44(d) basis only 
within the six-month priority period following the filing date of the 
foreign application.
    (f) When the applicant adds or substitutes a basis, the applicant 
must list each basis, followed by the goods or services to which that 
basis applies.
    (g) When the applicant deletes a basis, the applicant must also 
delete any goods or services covered solely by the deleted basis.
    (h) Once an applicant claims a section 1(b) basis as to any or all 
of the goods or services, the applicant may not amend the application to 
seek registration under section 1(a) of the Act for those goods or 
services unless the applicant files an allegation of use under section 
1(c) or section 1(d) of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 2.38  Use by predecessor or by related companies.

    (a) If the first use of the mark was by a predecessor in title or by 
a related company (sections 5 and 45 of the Act), and the use inures to 
the benefit of the applicant, the dates of first use (Secs. 2.34(a)(1) 
(ii) and (iii)) may be asserted with a statement that first use was by 
the predecessor in title or by the related company, as appropriate.
    (b) If the mark is not in fact being used by the applicant but is 
being used by one or more related companies whose use inures to the 
benefit of the applicant under section 5 of the Act, such facts must be 
indicated in the application.
    (c) The Office may require such details concerning the nature of the 
relationship and such proofs as may be necessary and appropriate for the 
purpose of showing that the use by related companies inures to the 
benefit of the applicant and does not affect the validity of the mark.

Sec. 2.39  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 2.41  Proof of distinctiveness under section 2(f).

    (a) When registration is sought of a mark which would be 
unregistrable by reason of section 2(e) of the Act but which is said by 
applicant to have become distinctive in commerce of the goods or 
services set forth in the application, applicant may, in support of 
registrability, submit with the application, or in response to a request 
for evidence or to a refusal to register, affidavits, or declarations in 
accordance with Sec. 2.20, depositions, or other appropriate evidence 
showing duration, extent and nature of use in commerce and advertising 
expenditures in connection therewith (identifying types of media and 
attaching typical advertisements), and affidavits, or declarations in 
accordance with Sec. 2.20, letters or statements from the trade or 
public, or both, or other appropriate evidence tending to show that the 
mark distinguishes such goods.
    (b) In appropriate cases, ownership of one or more prior 
registrations on the Principal Register or under the Act of 1905 of the 
same mark may be accepted as prima facie evidence of distinctiveness. 
Also, if the mark is said to have become distinctive of applicant's 
goods by reason of substantially exclusive and continuous use in 
commerce thereof by applicant for the five years before the date on 
which the claim of distinctiveness is made, a showing by way of 
statements which are verified or which include declarations in 
accordance with Sec. 2.20, in the application may, in appropriate cases, 
be accepted as prima facie evidence of distinctiveness. In each of these 
situations, however, further evidence may be required.

<R05>
Sec. 2.52  Types of drawings and format for drawings.

    (a) A drawing depicts the mark sought to be registered. The drawing 
must show only one mark. The applicant must include a clear drawing of 
the mark when the application is filed. There are two types of drawings:
    (1) Typed drawing. The drawing may be typed if the mark consists 
only of words, letters, numbers, common forms of punctuation, or any 
combination of these elements. In a typed drawing, every word or letter 
must be typed in uppercase type. If the applicant submits a typed 
drawing, the application is not limited to the mark depicted in any 
special form or lettering.
    (2) Special form drawing. A special form drawing is required if the 
mark has a two or three-dimensional design; or color; or words, letters, 
or numbers in a particular style of lettering; or unusual forms of 
punctuation.
    (i) Special form drawings must be made with a pen or by a process 
that will provide high definition when copied. A photolithographic, 
printer's proof copy, or other high quality reproduction of the mark may 
be used. Every line and letter, including lines used for shading, must 
be black. All lines must be clean, sharp, and solid, and must not be 
fine or crowded. Gray tones or tints may not be used for surface shading 
or any other purpose.
    (ii) If necessary to adequately depict the commercial impression of 
the mark, the applicant may be required to submit a drawing that shows 
the placement of the mark by surrounding the mark with a proportionately 
accurate broken-line representation of the particular goods, packaging, 
or advertising on which the mark appears. The applicant must also use 
broken lines to show any other matter not claimed as part of the mark. 
For any drawing using broken lines to indicate placement of the mark, or 
matter not claimed as part of the mark, the applicant must include in 
the body of the application a written description of the

[[Page 275]]

mark and explain the purpose of the broken lines.
    (iii) If the mark has three-dimensional features, the applicant must 
submit a drawing that depicts a single rendition of the mark, and the 
applicant must include a description of the mark indicating that the 
mark is three-dimensional.
    (iv) If the mark has motion, the applicant may submit a drawing that 
depicts a single point in the movement, or the applicant may submit a 
square drawing that contains up to five freeze frames showing various 
points in the movement, whichever best depicts the commercial impression 
of the mark. The applicant must also submit a written description of the 
mark.
    (v) If the mark has color, the applicant may claim that all or part 
of the mark consists of one or more colors. To claim color, the 
applicant must submit a statement explaining where the color or colors 
appear in the mark and the nature of the color(s).
    (vi) If a drawing cannot adequately depict all significant features 
of the mark, the applicant must also submit a written description of the 
mark.
    (3) Sound, scent, and non-visual marks. The applicant is not 
required to submit a drawing if the applicant's mark consists only of a 
sound, a scent, or other completely non-visual matter. For these types 
of marks, the applicant must submit a detailed written description of 
the mark.
    (b) Recommended format for special form drawings--(1) Type of paper 
and ink. The drawing should be on a piece of non-shiny, white paper that 
is separate from the application. Black ink should be used to depict the

    (2) Size of paper and size of mark. The drawing should be on paper 
that is 8 to 8\1/2\ inches (20.3 to 21.6 cm.) wide and 11 to 11.69 
inches (27.9 to 29.7 cm.) long. One of the shorter sides of the sheet 
should be regarded as its top edge. The drawing should be between 2.5 
inches (6.1 cm.) and 4 inches (10.3 cm.) high and/or wide. There should 
be at least a 1 inch (2.5 cm.) margin between the drawing and the edges 
of the paper, and at least a 1 inch (2.5 cm.) margin between the drawing 
and the heading.
    (3) Heading. Across the top of the drawing, beginning one inch (2.5 
cm.) from the top edge, the applicant should type the following: 
Applicant's name; applicant's address; the goods or services recited in 
the application, or a typical item of the goods or services if numerous 
items are recited in the application; the date of first use of the mark 
and first use of the mark in commerce in an application under section 
1(a) of the Act; the priority filing date of the relevant foreign 
application in an application claiming the benefit of a prior foreign 
application under section 44(d) of the Act. If the information in the 
heading is lengthy, the heading may continue onto a second page, but the 
mark should be depicted on the first page.
    (c) Drawings in electronically transmitted applications. For an 
electronically transmitted application, if the drawing is in special 
form, the applicant must attach a digitized image of the mark to the 
electronic submission.

Sec. 2.56  Specimens.

    (a) An application under section 1(a) of the Act, an amendment to 
allege use under Sec. 2.76, and a statement of use under Sec. 2.88 must 
each include one specimen showing the mark as used on or in connection 
with the goods, or in the sale or advertising of the services in 
commerce.
    (b)(1) A trademark specimen is a label, tag, or container for the 
goods, or a display associated with the goods. The Office may accept 
another document related to the goods or the sale of the goods when it 
is not possible to place the mark on the goods or packaging for the 
goods.
    (2) A service mark specimen must show the mark as actually used in 
the sale or advertising of the services.
    (3) A collective trademark or collective service mark specimen must 
show how a member uses the mark on the member's goods or in the sale or 
advertising of the member's services.
    (4) A collective membership mark specimen must show use by members 
to indicate membership in the collective organization.
    (5) A certification mark specimen must show how a person other than 
the owner uses the mark to certify regional or other origin, material, 
mode

[[Page 276]]

of manufacture, quality, accuracy, or other characteristics of that 
person's goods or services; or that members of a union or other 
organization performed the work or labor on the goods or services.
    (c) A photocopy or other reproduction of a specimen of the mark as 
actually used on or in connection with the goods, or in the sale or 
advertising of the services, is acceptable. However, a photocopy of the 
drawing required by Sec. 2.51 is not a proper specimen.
    (d)(1) The specimen should be flat, and not larger than 8\1/2\ 
inches (21.6 cm.) wide by 11.69 inches (29.7 cm.) long. If a specimen of 
this size is not available, the applicant may substitute a suitable 
photograph or other facsimile.
    (2) If the applicant files a specimen exceeding these size 
requirements (a ``bulky specimen''), the Office will create a facsimile 
of the specimen that meets the requirements of the rule (i.e., is flat 
and no larger than 8\1/2\ inches (21.6 cm.) wide by 11.69 inches (29.7 
cm.) long) and put it in the file wrapper.
    (3) In the absence of non-bulky alternatives, the Office may accept 
an audio or video cassette tape recording, CD-ROM, or other appropriate 
medium.
    (4) For an electronically transmitted application, or other 
electronic submission, the specimen must be submitted as a digitized 
image.

Sec. 2.59  Filing substitute specimen(s).

    (a) In an application under section 1(a) of the Act, the applicant 
may submit substitute specimens of the mark as used on or in connection 
with the goods, or in the sale or advertising of the services. The 
applicant must verify by an affidavit or declaration under Sec. 2.20 
that the substitute specimens were in use in commerce at least as early 
as the filing date of the application. Verification is not required if 
the specimen is a duplicate or facsimile of a specimen already of record 
in the application.
    (b) In an application under section 1(b) of the Act, after filing 
either an amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76 or a statement of use 
under Sec. 2.88, the applicant may submit substitute specimens of the 
mark as used on or in connection with the goods, or in the sale or 
advertising of the services. If the applicant submits substitute 
specimen(s), the applicant must:
    (1) For an amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76, verify by 
affidavit or declaration under Sec. 2.20 that the applicant used the 
substitute specimen(s) in commerce prior to filing the amendment to 
allege use.
    (2) For a statement of use under Sec. 2.88, verify by affidavit or 
declaration under Sec. 2.20 that the applicant used the substitute 
specimen(s) in commerce either prior to filing the statement of use or 
prior to the expiration of the deadline for filing the statement of use.

           Examination of Application and Action by Applicants

    Authority: Secs. 2.61 to 2.69 also issued under sec. 12, 60 Stat. 
432; 15 U.S.C. 1062.


<R05>
Sec. 2.61  Action by examiner.

    (a) Applications for registration, including amendments to allege 
use under section 1(c) of the Act, and statements of use under section 
1(d) of the Act, will be examined and, if the applicant is found not 
entitled to registration for any reason, applicant will be notified and 
advised of the reasons therefor and of any formal requirements or 
objections.
    (b) The examiner may require the applicant to furnish such 
information and exhibits as may be reasonably necessary to the proper 
examination of the application.
    (c) Whenever it shall be found that two or more parties whose 
interests are in conflict are represented by the same attorney, each 
party and also the attorney shall be notified of this fact.

<R05>
Sec. 2.62  Period for response.

    The applicant has six months from the date of mailing of any action 
by the examiner to respond thereto. Such response may be made with or 
without amendment and must include such proper action by the applicant 
as the

[[Page 277]]

nature of the action and the condition of the case may require.


<R05>
Sec. 2.63  Reexamination.

    (a) After response by the applicant, the application will be 
reexamined or reconsidered. If registration is again refused or any 
formal requirement[s] is repeated, but the examiner's action is not 
stated to be final, the applicant may respond again.
    (b) After reexamination the applicant may respond by filing a timely 
petition to the Commissioner for relief from a formal requirement if: 
(1) The requirement is repeated, but the examiner's action is not made 
final, and the subject matter of the requirement is appropriate for 
petition to the Commissioner (see Sec. 2.146(b)); or (2) the examiner's 
action is made final and such action is limited to subject matter 
appropriate for petition to the Commissioner. If the petition is denied, 
the applicant shall have until six months from the date of the Office 
action which repeated the requirement or made it final or thirty days 
from the date of the decision on the petition, whichever date is later, 
to comply with the requirement. A formal requirement which is the 
subject of a petition decided by the Commissioner may not subsequently 
be the subject of an appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.

[48 FR 23134, May 23, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 2.64  Final action.

    (a) On the first or any subsequent reexamination or reconsideration 
the refusal of the registration or the insistence upon a requirement may 
be stated to be final, whereupon applicant's response is limited to an 
appeal, or to a compliance with any requirement, or to a petition to the 
Commissioner if permitted by Sec. 2.63(b).
    (b) During the period between a final action and expiration of the 
time for filing an appeal, the applicant may request the examiner to 
reconsider the final action. The filing of a request for reconsideration 
will not extend the time for filing an appeal or petitioning the 
Commissioner, but normally the examiner will reply to a request for 
reconsideration before the end of the six-month period if the request is 
filed within three months after the date of the final action. Amendments 
accompanying requests for reconsideration after final action will be 
entered if they comply with the rules of practice in trademark cases and 
the Act of 1946.
    (c)(1) If an applicant in an application under section 1(b) of the 
Act files an amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76 during the six-
month response period after issuance of a final action, the examiner 
shall examine the amendment. The filing of such an amendment will not 
extend the time for filing an appeal or petitioning the Commissioner.
    (2) If the amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76 is acceptable in 
all respects, the applicant will be notified of its acceptance.
    (3) If, as a result of the examination of the amendment to allege 
use under Sec. 2.76, the applicant is found not entitled to registration 
for any reason not previously stated, applicant will be notified and 
advised of the reasons and of any formal requirements or refusals. The 
Trademark Examining Attorney shall withdraw the final action previously 
issued and shall incorporate all unresolved refusals or requirements 
previously stated in the new non-final action.

<R05>
Sec. 2.65  Abandonment.

    (a) If an applicant fails to respond, or to respond completely, 
within six months after the date an action is mailed, the application 
shall be deemed to have been abandoned. A timely petition to the 
Commissioner pursuant to Secs. 2.63(b) and 2.146 is a response which 
avoids abandonment of an application.
    (b) When action by the applicant filed within the six-month response 
period is a bona fide attempt to advance the examination of the 
application and is substantially a complete response to the examiner's 
action, but consideration of some matter or compliance with some 
requirement has been inadvertently omitted, opportunity to explain and 
supply the omission may be given before the question of abandonment is 
considered.
    (c) If an applicant in an application under section 1(b) of the Act 
fails to timely file a statement of use under

[[Page 278]]

Sec. 2.88, the application shall be deemed to be abandoned.

Sec. 2.66  Revival of abandoned applications.

    (a) The applicant may file a petition to revive an application 
abandoned because the applicant did not timely respond to an Office 
action or notice of allowance, if the delay was unintentional. The 
applicant must file the petition:
    (1) Within two months of the mailing date of the notice of 
abandonment; or
    (2) Within two months of actual knowledge of the abandonment, if the 
applicant did not receive the notice of abandonment, and the applicant 
was diligent in checking the status of the application. To be diligent, 
the applicant must check the status of the application within one year 
of the last filing or receipt of a notice from the Office for which 
further action by the Office is expected.
    (b) The requirements for filing a petition to revive an application 
abandoned because the applicant did not timely respond to an Office 
action are:
    (1) The petition fee required by Sec. 2.6;
    (2) A statement, signed by someone with firsthand knowledge of the 
facts, that the delay in filing the response on or before the due date 
was unintentional; and
    (3) Unless the applicant alleges that it did not receive the Office 
action, the proposed response.
    (c) The requirements for filing a petition to revive an application 
abandoned because the applicant did not timely respond to a notice of 
allowance are:
    (1) The petition fee required by Sec. 2.6;
    (2) A statement, signed by someone with firsthand knowledge of the 
facts, that the delay in filing the statement of use (or request for 
extension of time to file a statement of use) on or before the due date 
was unintentional;
    (3) Unless the applicant alleges that it did not receive the notice 
of allowance and requests cancellation of the notice of allowance, the 
required fees for the number of requests for extensions of time to file 
a statement of use that the applicant should have filed under Sec. 2.89 
if the application had never been abandoned;
    (4) Unless the applicant alleges that it did not receive the notice 
of allowance and requests cancellation of the notice of allowance, 
either a statement of use under Sec. 2.88 or a request for an extension 
of time to file a statement of use under Sec. 2.89; and
    (5) Unless a statement of use is filed with or before the petition, 
or the applicant alleges that it did not receive the notice of allowance 
and requests cancellation of the notice of allowance, the applicant must 
file any further requests for extensions of time to file a statement of 
use under Sec. 2.89 that become due while the petition is pending, or 
file a statement of use under Sec. 2.88.
    (d) In an application under section 1(b) of the Act, the 
Commissioner will not grant the petition if this would permit the filing 
of a statement of use more than 36 months after the mailing date of the 
notice of allowance under section 13(b)(2) of the Act.
    (e) The Commissioner will grant the petition to revive if the 
applicant complies with the requirements listed above and establishes 
that the delay in responding was unintentional.
    (f) If the Commissioner denies a petition, the applicant may request 
reconsideration, if the applicant:
    (1) Files the request within two months of the mailing date of the 
decision denying the petition; and
    (2) Pays a second petition fee under Sec. 2.6.

Sec. 2.67  Suspension of action by the Patent and Trademark Office.

    Action by the Patent and Trademark Office may be suspended for a 
reasonable time for good and sufficient cause. The fact that a 
proceeding is pending before the Patent and Trademark Office or a court 
which is relevant to the issue of registrability of the applicant's 
mark, or the fact that the basis for registration is, under the 
provisions of section 44(e) of the Act, registration of the mark in a 
foreign country and the foreign application is still pending, will be 
considered prima facie good and sufficient cause. An applicant's request 
for a suspension of action under this

[[Page 279]]

section filed within the 6-month response period (see Sec. 2.62) may be 
considered responsive to the previous Office action. The first 
suspension is within the discretion of the Examiner of Trademarks and 
any subsequent suspension must be approved by the Commissioner.

Sec. 2.68  Express abandonment (withdrawal) of application.

    An application may be expressly abandoned by filing in the Patent 
and Trademark Office a written statement of abandonment or withdrawal of 
the application signed by the applicant, or the attorney or other person 
representing the applicant. Except as provided in Sec. 2.135, the fact 
that an application has been expressly abandoned shall not, in any 
proceeding in the Patent and Trademark Office, affect any rights that 
the applicant may have in the mark which is the subject of the abandoned 
application.

Sec. 2.69  Compliance with other laws.

    When the sale or transportation of any product for which 
registration of a trademark is sought is regulated under an Act of 
Congress, the Patent and Trademark Office may make appropriate inquiry 
as to compliance with such Act for the sole purpose of determining 
lawfulness of the commerce recited in the application.

                        Amendment of Application


<R05>
Sec. 2.71  Amendments to correct informalities.

    The applicant may amend the application during the course of 
examination, when required by the Office or for other reasons.
    (a) The applicant may amend the application to clarify or limit, but 
not to broaden, the identification of goods and/or services.
    (b)(1) If the declaration or verification of an application under 
Sec. 2.33 is unsigned or signed by the wrong party, the applicant may 
submit a substitute verification or declaration under Sec. 2.20.
    (2) If the declaration or verification of a statement of use under 
Sec. 2.88, or a request for extension of time to file a statement of use 
under Sec. 2.89, is unsigned or signed by the wrong party, the applicant 
must submit a substitute verification before the expiration of the 
statutory deadline for filing the statement of use.
    (c) The applicant may amend the dates of use, provided that the 
applicant supports the amendment with an affidavit or declaration under 
Sec. 2.20, except that the following amendments are not permitted:
    (1) In an application under section 1(a) of the Act, the applicant 
may not amend the application to specify a date of use that is 
subsequent to the filing date of the application;
    (2) In an application under section 1(b) of the Act, after filing a 
statement of use under Sec. 2.88, the applicant may not amend the 
statement of use to specify a date of use that is subsequent to the 
expiration of the deadline for filing the statement of use.
    (d) The applicant may amend the application to correct the name of 
the applicant, if there is a mistake in the manner in which the name of 
the applicant is set out in the application. The amendment must be 
supported by an affidavit or declaration under Sec. 2.20, signed by the 
applicant. However, the application cannot be amended to set forth a 
different entity as the applicant. An application filed in the name of 
an entity that did not own the mark as of the filing date of the 
application is void.

<R05>
Sec. 2.72  Amendments to description or drawing of the mark.

    (a) In an application based on use in commerce under section 1(a) of 
the Act, the applicant may amend the description or drawing of the mark 
only if:
    (1) The specimens originally filed, or substitute specimens filed 
under Sec. 2.59(a), support the proposed amendment; and
    (2) The proposed amendment does not materially alter the mark. The 
Office will determine whether a proposed amendment materially alters a 
mark by comparing the proposed amendment

[[Page 280]]

with the description or drawing of the mark filed with the original 
application.
    (b) In an application based on a bona fide intention to use a mark 
in commerce under section 1(b) of the Act, the applicant may amend the 
description or drawing of the mark only if:
    (1) The specimens filed with an amendment to allege use or statement 
of use, or substitute specimens filed under Sec. 2.59(b), support the 
proposed amendment; and
    (2) The proposed amendment does not materially alter the mark. The 
Office will determine whether a proposed amendment materially alters a 
mark by comparing the proposed amendment with the description or drawing 
of the mark filed with the original application.
    (c) In an application based on a claim of priority under section 
44(d) of the Act, or on a mark duly registered in the country of origin 
of the foreign applicant under section 44(e) of the Act, the applicant 
may amend the description or drawing of the mark only if:
    (1) The description or drawing of the mark in the foreign 
registration certificate supports the amendment; and
    (2) The proposed amendment does not materially alter the mark. The 
Office will determine whether a proposed amendment materially alters a 
mark by comparing the proposed amendment with the description or drawing 
of the mark filed with the original application.

Sec. 2.73  Amendment to recite concurrent use.

    (a) An application under section 1(a) of the Act may be amended so 
as to be treated as an application for a concurrent registration, 
provided the application as amended satisfies the requirements of 
Sec. 2.42. The examiner will determine whether the application, as 
amended, is acceptable.
    (b) An application under section 1(b) of the Act may not be amended 
so as to be treated as an application for a concurrent registration 
until an acceptable amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76 or statement 
of use under Sec. 2.88 has been filed in the application, after which 
time such an amendment may be made, provided the application as amended 
satisfies the requirements of Sec. 2.42. The examiner will determine 
whether the application, as amended, is acceptable.

Sec. 2.74  Form of amendment.

    (a) In every amendment the exact word or words to be stricken out or 
inserted in the application must be specified and the precise point 
indicated where the deletion or insertion is to be made. Erasures, 
additions, insertions, or mutilations of the papers and records must not 
be made by the applicant or his attorney or agent.
    (b) When an amendatory clause is amended, it must be wholly 
rewritten so that no interlineation or erasure will appear in the 
clause, as finally amended, when the application is passed to 
registration. If the number or nature of the amendments shall render it 
otherwise difficult to consider the case or to arrange the papers for 
printing or copying, or when otherwise desired to clarify the record, 
the examiner may require the entire statement to be rewritten.


<R05>
Sec. 2.75  Amendment to change application to different register.

    (a) An application for registration on the Principal Register under 
section 1(a) or 44 of the Act may be changed to an application for 
registration on the Supplemental Register and vice versa by amending the 
application to comply with the rules relating to the appropriate 
register, as the case may be.
    (b) An application under section 1(b) of the Act may be amended to 
change the application to a different register only after submission of 
an acceptable amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76 or statement of 
use under Sec. 2.88. When such an application is changed from the 
Principal Register to the Supplemental Register, the effective filing 
date of the application is the date of the filing of the allegation of 
use under section 1(c) or 1(d) of the Act.

<R05>
Sec. 2.76  Amendment to allege use.

    (a) An application under section 1(b) of the Act may be amended to 
allege

[[Page 281]]

use of the mark in commerce under section 1(c) of the Act at any time 
between the filing of the application and the date the examiner approves 
the mark for publication. Thereafter, an allegation of use may be 
submitted only as a statement of use under Sec. 2.88 after the issuance 
of a notice of allowance under section 13(b)(2) of the Act. If an 
amendment to allege use is filed outside the time period specified in 
this paragraph, it will be returned to the applicant.
    (b) A complete amendment to allege use must include:
    (1) A statement that is signed and verified (sworn to) or supported 
by a declaration under Sec. 2.20 by a person properly authorized to sign 
on behalf of the applicant (see Sec. 2.33(a)) that:
    (i) The applicant believes it is the owner of the mark; and
    (ii) The mark is in use in commerce, specifying the date of the 
applicant's first use of the mark and first use of the mark in commerce, 
and those goods or services specified in the application on or in 
connection with which the applicant uses the mark in commerce.
    (2) One specimen of the mark as actually used in commerce. See 
Sec. 2.56 for the requirements for specimens; and
    (3) The fee per class required by Sec. 2.6.
    (c) An amendment to allege use may be filed only when the applicant 
has made use of the mark in commerce on or in connection with all of the 
goods or services, as specified in the application, for which applicant 
will seek registration in that application unless the amendment to 
allege use is accompanied by a request in accordance with Sec. 2.87 to 
divide out from the application the goods or services to which the 
amendment pertains. If more than one item of goods or services is 
specified in the amendment to allege use, the dates of use required in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section need be for only one of the items 
specified in each class, provided the particular item to which the dates 
apply is designated.
    (d) The title ``Amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76'' should 
appear at the top of the first page of the paper.
    (e) The Office will review a timely filed amendment to allege use to 
determine whether it meets the following minimum requirements:
    (1) The fee prescribed in Sec. 2.6;
    (2) One specimen or facsimile of the mark as used in commerce; and
    (3) A statement that is signed and verified (sworn to) or supported 
by a declaration under Sec. 2.20 by a person properly authorized to sign 
on behalf of the applicant that the mark is in use in commerce.
    (f) A timely filed amendment to allege use which meets the minimum 
requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section will be examined 
in accordance with Secs. 2.61 through 2.69. If, as a result of the 
examination of the amendment to allege use, applicant is found not 
entitled to registration for any reason not previously stated, applicant 
will be so notified and advised of the reasons and of any formal 
requirements or refusals. The notification shall restate or incorporate 
by reference all unresolved refusals or requirements previously stated. 
The amendment to allege use may be amended in accordance with Secs. 2.59 
and 2.71 through 2.75. If the amendment to allege use is acceptable in 
all respects, the applicant will be notified of its acceptance. The 
filing of such an amendment shall not constitute a response to any 
outstanding action by the Trademark Examining Attorney.
    (g) If the amendment to allege use is filed within the permitted 
time period but does not meet the minimum requirements specified in 
paragraph (e) of this section, applicant will be notified of the 
deficiency. The deficiency may be corrected provided the mark has not 
been approved for publication. If an acceptable amendment to correct the 
deficiency is not filed prior to approval of the mark for publication, 
the amendment will not be examined.
    (h) An amendment to allege use may be withdrawn for any reason prior 
to approval of a mark for publication.
    (i) If the applicant does not file the amendment to allege use 
within a reasonable time after it is signed, the Office may require a 
substitute verification or declaration under Sec. 2.20 stating that the 
mark is still in use in commerce.

Sec. 2.77  Amendments between notice of allowance and statement of use.

    An application under section 1(b) of the Act may not be amended 
during the period between the issuance of the notice of allowance under 
section 13(b)(2) of the Act and the filing of a statement of use under 
Sec. 2.88, except to delete specified goods or services. Other 
amendments filed during this period will be placed in the application 
file and considered when the statement of use is examined.

                    Publication and Post Publication


<R05>
Sec. 2.80  Publication for opposition.

    If, on examination or reexamination of an application for 
registration on the Principal Register, it appears that the applicant is 
entitled to have his mark registered, the mark will be published in the 
Official Gazette for opposition. The mark will also be published in the 
case of an application to be placed in interference or concurrent use 
proceedings, if otherwise registrable.

[41 FR 758, Jan. 5, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 2.81  Post publication.

    (a) Except in an application under section 1(b) of the Act for which 
no amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76 has been submitted and 
accepted, if no opposition is filed within the time permitted or all 
oppositions filed are dismissed, and if no interference is declared and 
no concurrent use proceeding is instituted, the application will be 
prepared for issuance of the certificate of registration as provided in 
Sec. 2.151.
    (b) In an application under section 1(b) of the Act for which no 
amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76 has been submitted and accepted, 
if no opposition is filed within the time permitted or all oppositions 
filed are dismissed, and if no interference is declared, a notice of 
allowance will issue. The notice of allowance will state the serial 
number of the application, the name of the applicant, the correspondence 
address, the mark, the identification of goods or services, and the 
issue date of the notice of allowance. The mailing date that appears on 
the notice of allowance will be the issue date of the notice of 
allowance. Thereafter, the applicant shall submit a statement of use as 
provided in Sec. 2.88.

<R05>
Sec. 2.82  Marks on Supplemental Register published only upon registration.

    In the case of an application for registration on the Supplemental 
Register the mark will not be published for opposition but if it 
appears, after examination or reexamination, that the applicant is 
entitled to have the mark registered, a certificate of registration will 
issue as provided in Sec. 2.151. The mark will be published in the 
``Official Gazette'' when registered.

<R05>
Sec. 2.83  Conflicting marks.

    (a) Whenever an application is made for registration of a mark which 
so resembles another mark or marks pending registration as to be likely 
to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive, the mark with the earliest 
effective filing date will be published in the ``Official Gazette'' for 
opposition if eligible for the Principal Register, or issued a 
certificate of registration if eligible for the Supplemental Register.
    (b) In situations in which conflicting applications have the same 
effective filing date, the application with the earliest date of 
execution will be published in the ``Official Gazette'' for opposition 
or issued on the Supplemental Register.
    (c) Action on the conflicting application which is not published in 
the Official Gazette for opposition or not issued on the Supplemental 
Register will be suspended by the Examiner of Trademarks until the 
published or issued application is registered or abandoned.

<R05>
Sec. 2.84  Jurisdiction over published applications.

    (a) The examiner may exercise jurisdiction over an application up to 
the date the mark is published in the ``Official Gazette.'' After 
publication of an application under section 1(a) or 44 of the Act the 
examiner may, with the permission of the Commissioner, exercise 
jurisdiction over the application. After publication of an application 
under section 1(b) of the Act, the examiner may exercise jurisdiction 
over the application after the issuance of the notice of allowance under 
section 13(b)(2) of the Act. After publication, and prior to issuance of 
a notice of allowance in an application under section 1(b), the examiner 
may, with the permission of the Commissioner, exercise jurisdiction over 
the application.
    (b) After publication, but before the printing of the certificate of 
registration in an application under section 1(a) or 44 of the Act, or 
before the printing of the notice of allowance in an application under 
section 1(b) of the Act, an application which is not the subject of an 
inter partes proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board may 
be amended if the amendment does not necessitate republication of the 
mark or issuance of an Office action. Otherwise, an amendment to such an 
application may be submitted only upon petition to the Commissioner to 
restore jurisdiction of the application to the examiner for 
consideration of the amendment and further examination. The amendment of 
an application which is the subject of an inter partes proceeding before 
the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is governed by Sec. 2.133.

                             Classification


<R05>
Sec. 2.85  Classification schedules.

    (a) Section 6.1 of part 6 of this chapter specifies the system of 
classification for goods and services which applies for all statutory 
purposes to trademark applications filed in the Patent and Trademark 
Office on or after September 1, 1973, and to registrations issued on the 
basis of such applications. It shall not apply to applications filed on 
or before August 31, 1973, nor to registrations issued on the basis of 
such applications.
    (b) With respect to applications filed on or before August 31, 1973, 
and registrations issued thereon, including older registrations issued 
prior to that date, the classification system under which the 
application was filed will govern for all statutory purposes, including, 
inter alia, the filing of petitions to revive, appeals, oppositions, 
petitions for cancellation, affidavits under section 8 and renewals, 
even though such petitions to revive, appeals, etc., are filed on or 
after September 1, 1973.
    (c) Section 6.2 of part 6 of this chapter specifies the system of 
classification for goods and services which applies for all statutory 
purposes to all trademark applications filed in the Patent and Trademark 
Office on or before August 31, 1973, and to registrations issued on the 
basis of such applications, except when the registration may have been 
issued under a classification system prior to that set forth in 
Sec. 6.2. Moreover, this classification will also be utilized for 
facilitating trademark searches until all pending and registered marks 
in the search file are organized on the basis of the international 
system of classification.
    (d) Renewals filed on registrations issued under a prior 
classification system will be processed on the basis of that system.
    (e) Where the amount of the fee received on filing an appeal in 
connection with an application or on an application for renewal is 
sufficient for at least one class of goods or services but is less than 
the required amount because multiple classes in an application or 
registration are involved, the appeal or renewal application will not be 
refused on the ground that the amount of the fee was insufficient if the 
required additional amount of the fee is received in the Patent and 
Trademark Office within the time limit set forth in the notification of 
this defect by the Office, or if action is sought only for the number of 
classes equal to the number of fees submitted.
    (f) Sections 6.3 and 6.4 specify the system of classification which 
applies to certification marks and collective membership marks.

[[Page 284]]

    (g) Classification schedules shall not limit or extend the 
applicant's rights.

Sec. 2.86  Application may include multiple classes.

    (a) In a single application, an applicant may apply to register the 
same mark for goods and/or services in multiple classes. The applicant 
must:
    (1) Specifically identify the goods or services in each class;
    (2) Submit an application filing fee for each class; and
    (3) Include either dates of use (see Secs. 2.34(a)(1)(ii) and (iii)) 
and one specimen for each class, or a statement of a bona fide intention 
to use the mark in commerce on or in connection with all the goods or 
services specified in each class. The applicant may not claim both use 
in commerce and a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce for 
the identical goods or services in one application.
    (b) An amendment to allege use under Sec. 2.76 or a statement of use 
under Sec. 2.88 must include, for each class, the required fee, dates of 
use, and one specimen. The applicant may not file the amendment to 
allege use or statement of use until the applicant has used the mark on 
all the goods or services, unless the applicant files a request to 
divide. See Sec. 2.87 for information regarding requests to divide.
    (c) The Office will issue a single certificate of registration for 
the mark, unless the applicant files a request to divide. See Sec. 2.87 
for information regarding requests to divide.

<R05>
Sec. 2.87  Dividing an application.

    (a) An application may be physically divided into two or more 
separate applications upon the payment of a fee for each new application 
created and submission by the applicant of a request in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) In the case of a request to divide out one or more entire 
classes from an application, only the fee under paragraph (a) of this 
section will be required. However, in the case of a request to divide 
out some, but not all, of the goods or services in a class, an 
application filing fee for each new separate application to be created 
by the division must be submitted, together with the fee under paragraph 
(a) of this section. Any outstanding time period for action by the 
applicant in the original application at the time of the division will 
be applicable to each new separate application created by the division.
    (c) A request to divide an application may be filed at any time 
between the filing of the application and the date the Trademark 
Examining Attorney approves the mark for publication; or during an 
opposition, concurrent use, or interference proceeding, upon motion 
granted by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Additionally, a request 
to divide an application under section 1(b) of the Act may be filed with 
a statement of use under Sec. 2.88 or at any time between the filing of 
a statement of use and the date the Trademark Examining Attorney 
approves the mark for registration.
    (d) A request to divide an application should be made in a separate 
paper from any other amendment or response in the application. The title 
``Request to divide application.'' should appear at the top of the first 
page of the paper.

                        Post Notice of Allowance


<R05>
Sec. 2.88  Filing statement of use after notice of allowance.

    (a) In an application under section 1(b) of the Act, a statement of 
use, required under section 1(d) of the Act, must be filed within six 
months after issuance of a notice of allowance under section 13(b)(2) of 
the Act, or within an extension of time granted under Sec. 2.89. A 
statement of use that is filed prior to issuance of a notice of 
allowance is premature, will not be considered, and will be returned to 
the applicant.
    (b) A complete statement of use must include:
    (1) A statement that is signed and verified (sworn to) or supported 
by a declaration under Sec. 2.20 by a person

[[Page 285]]

properly authorized to sign on behalf of the applicant (see 
Sec. 2.33(a)) that:
    (i) The applicant believes it is the owner of the mark; and
    (ii) The mark is in use in commerce, specifying the date of the 
applicant's first use of the mark and first use of the mark in commerce, 
and those goods or services specified in the notice of allowance on or 
in connection with which the applicant uses the mark in commerce;
    (2) One specimen of the mark as actually used in commerce. See 
Sec. 2.56 for the requirements for specimens; and
    (3) The fee per class required by Sec. 2.6.
    (c) The statement of use may be filed only when the applicant has 
made use of the mark in commerce on or in connection with all of the 
goods or services, as specified in the notice of allowance, for which 
applicant will seek registration in that application, unless the 
statement of use is accompanied by a request in accordance with 
Sec. 2.87 to divide out from the application the goods or services to 
which the statement of use pertains. If more than one item of goods or 
services is specified in the statement of use, the dates of use required 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section need be for only one of the items 
specified in each class, provided the particular item to which the dates 
apply is designated.
    (d) The title ``Statement of use under Sec. 2.88.'' should appear at 
the top of the first page of the paper.
    (e) The Office will review a timely filed statement of use to 
determine whether it meets the following minimum requirements:
    (1) The fee for at least a single class, required by Sec. 2.6;
    (2) One specimen of the mark as used in commerce;
    (3) A statement that is signed and verified (sworn to) or supported 
by a declaration under Sec. 2.20 by a person properly authorized to sign 
on behalf of the applicant that the mark is in use in commerce. If the 
verification or declaration is unsigned or signed by the wrong party, 
the applicant must submit a substitute verification on or before the 
statutory deadline for filing the statement of use.
    (f) A timely filed statement of use which meets the minimum 
requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section will be examined 
in accordance with Secs. 2.61 through 2.69. If, as a result of the 
examination of the statement of use, applicant is found not entitled to 
registration, applicant will be notified and advised of the reasons and 
of any formal requirements or refusals. The statement of use may be 
amended in accordance with Secs. 2.59 and 2.71 through 2.75. If the 
statement of use is acceptable in all respects, the applicant will be 
notified of its acceptance.
    (g) If the statement of use does not meet the minimum requirements 
specified in paragraph (e) of this section, applicant will be notified 
of the deficiency. If the time permitted for applicant to file a 
statement of use has not expired, applicant may correct the deficiency. 
After the filing of a statement of use during a permitted time period 
for such filing, the applicant may not withdraw the statement to return 
to the previous status of awaiting submission of a statement of use, 
regardless of whether it is in compliance with paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (h) The failure to timely file a statement of use which meets the 
minimum requirements specified in paragraph (e) of this section shall 
result in the abandonment of the application.
    (i)(1) The goods or services specified in a statement of use must 
conform to those goods or services identified in the notice of 
allowance. An applicant may specify the goods or services by stating 
``those goods or services identified in the notice of allowance'' or, if 
appropriate, ``those goods or services identified in the notice of 
allowance except * * *'' followed by an identification of the goods or 
services to be deleted.
    (2) If any goods or services specified in the notice of allowance 
are omitted from the identification of goods or services in the 
statement of use, the Trademark Examining Attorney shall inquire about 
the discrepancy and permit the applicant to amend the statement of use 
to include any omitted goods or services, provided that the amendment is 
supported by a verification that the mark was in use in commerce, on or 
in connection with each of the goods or services sought to be included, 
prior to the expiration of

[[Page 286]]

the time allowed to applicant for filing a statement of use.
    (3) The statement of use may be accompanied by a separate request to 
amend the identification of goods or services in the application, as 
stated in the notice of allowance, in accordance with Sec. 2.71(b).
    (j) The statement of use may be accompanied by a separate request to 
amend the drawing in the application, in accordance with Secs. 2.51 and 
2.72.
    (k) If the statement of use is not filed within a reasonable time 
after the date it is signed, the Office may require a substitute 
verification or declaration under Sec. 2.20 stating that the mark is 
still in use in commerce.
    (l) For the requirements for a multiple class application, see 
Sec. 2.86.

<R05>
Sec. 2.89  Extensions of time for filing a statement of use.

    (a) The applicant may request a six-month extension of time to file 
the statement of use required by Sec. 2.88. The extension request must 
be filed within six months of the mailing date of the notice of 
allowance under section 13(b)(2) of the Act and must include the 
following:
    (1) A written request for an extension of time to file the statement 
of use;
    (2) The fee per class required by Sec. 2.6; and
    (3) A statement that is signed and verified (sworn to) or supported 
by a declaration under Sec. 2.20 by a person properly authorized to sign 
on behalf of the applicant (see Sec. 2.33(a)) that the applicant still 
has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce, specifying the 
relevant goods or services. If the verification is unsigned or signed by 
the wrong party, the applicant must submit a substitute verification 
within six months of the mailing date of the notice of allowance.
    (b) Before the expiration of the previously granted extension of 
time, the applicant may request further six month extensions of time to 
file the statement of use by submitting the following:
    (1) A written request for an extension of time to file the statement 
of use;
    (2) The fee per class required by Sec. 2.6;
    (3) A statement that is signed and verified (sworn to) or supported 
by a declaration under Sec. 2.20 by a person properly authorized to sign 
on behalf of the applicant (see Sec. 2.33(a)) that the applicant still 
has a bona fide intention to use the mark in commerce, specifying the 
relevant goods or services. If the verification is unsigned or signed by 
the wrong party, the applicant must submit a substitute verification 
before the expiration of the previously granted extension; and
    (4) A showing of good cause, as specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (c) Extensions of time under paragraph (b) of this section will be 
granted only in six-month increments and may not aggregate more than 24 
months.
    (d) The showing of good cause must include a statement of the 
applicant's ongoing efforts to make use of the mark in commerce on or in 
connection with each of the relevant goods or services. Those efforts 
may include product or service research or development, market research, 
manufacturing activities, promotional activities, steps to acquire 
distributors, steps to obtain governmental approval, or other similar 
activities. In the alternative, the applicant must submit a satisfactory 
explanation for the failure to make efforts to use the mark in commerce.
    (e)(1) At the time of the filing of a statement of use, or during 
any time remaining in the existing six-month period in which a statement 
of use is filed, applicant may file one request, in accordance with 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, for a six-month extension of time 
for filing a statement of use, provided that the time requested would 
not extend beyond 36 months from the issuance of the notice of 
allowance. Thereafter, applicant may not request any further extensions 
of time.
    (2) A request for an extension of time that is filed at the time of 
the filing of a statement of use, or during any time remaining in the 
existing six-month period in which a statement of use is filed, must 
comply with all the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, if it 
is applicant's first extension request, or paragraph (b) of this 
section, if it is a second or subsequent extension request. However, in 
a request

[[Page 287]]

under paragraph (b) of this section, applicant may satisfy the 
requirement for a showing of good cause by asserting that applicant 
believes that it has made valid use of the mark in commerce, as 
evidenced by the submitted statement of use, but that if the statement 
of use is found by the Patent and Trademark Office to be fatally 
defective, applicant will need additional time in which to file a new 
statement of use.
    (f) The goods or services specified in a request for an extension of 
time for filing a statement of use must conform to those goods or 
services identified in the notice of allowance. Any goods or services 
specified in the notice of allowance which are omitted from the 
identification of goods or services in the request for extension of time 
will be presumed to be deleted and the applicant may not thereafter 
request that the deleted goods or services be reinserted in the 
application. If appropriate, an applicant may specify the goods or 
services by stating ``those goods or services identified in the notice 
of allowance'' or ``those goods or services identified in the notice of 
allowance except * * *'' followed by an identification of the goods or 
services to be deleted.
    (g) The applicant will be notified of the grant or denial of a 
request for an extension of time, and of the reasons for a denial. 
Failure to notify the applicant of the grant or denial of the request 
prior to the expiration of the existing period or requested extension 
does not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of timely filing a 
statement of use under Sec. 2.88. If, after denial of an extension 
request, there is time remaining in the existing six-month period for 
filing a statement of use, applicant may submit a substitute request for 
extension of time. Otherwise, the only recourse available after denial 
of a request for an extension of time is a petition to the Commissioner 
in accordance with Secs. 2.66 or 2.146. A petition from the denial of a 
request for an extension of time to file a statement of use shall be 
filed within two months of the mailing date of the denial of the 
request. If the petition is granted, the term of the requested six month 
extension that was the subject of the petition will run from the date of 
the expiration of the previously existing six month period for filing a 
statement of use.
    (h) If the extension request is not filed within a reasonable time 
after it is signed, the Office may require a substitute verification or 
declaration under Sec. 2.20 stating that the applicant still has a bona 
fide intention to use the mark in commerce.

Sec. 2.91  Declaration of interference.

    (a) An interference will not be declared between two applications or 
between an application and a registration except upon petition to the 
Commissioner. Interferences will be declared by the Commissioner only 
upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances which would result in a 
party being unduly prejudiced without an interference. In ordinary 
circumstances, the availability of an opposition or cancellation 
proceeding to the party will be deemed to remove any undue prejudice.
    (b) Registrations and applications to register on the Supplemental 
Register, registrations under the Act of 1920, and registrations of 
marks the right to use of which has become incontestable are not subject 
to interference.

Sec. 2.92  Preliminary to interference.

    An interference which has been declared by the Commissioner will not 
be instituted by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board until the Examiner 
of Trademarks has determined that the marks which are to form the 
subject matter of the controversy are registrable, and all of the marks 
have been published in the Official Gazette for opposition.

<R05>
Sec. 2.93  Institution of interference.

    An interference is instituted by the mailing of a notice of 
interference to the parties. The notice shall be sent to each applicant, 
in care of the applicant's attorney or other representative of record, 
if any, and if one of the parties is a registrant, the notice shall be 
sent to the registrant or the registrant's assignee of record. The 
notice shall give the name and address of every adverse party and of the 
adverse party's attorney or other authorized representative, if any, 
together with the serial number and date of filing and publication of 
each of the applications, or the registration number and date of 
issuance of each of the registrations, involved.

Sec. 2.96  Issue; burden of proof.

    The issue in an interference between applications is normally 
priority of use, but the rights of the parties to registration may also 
be determined. The party whose application involved in the interference 
has the latest filing date is the junior party and has the burden of 
proof. When there are more than two parties to an interference, a party 
shall be a junior party to and shall have the burden of proof as against 
every other party whose application involved in the interference has an 
earlier filing date. If the involved applications of any parties have 
the same filing date, the application with the latest date of execution 
will be deemed to have the latest filing date and that applicant will be 
the junior party. The issue in an interference between an application 
and a registration shall be the same, but in the event the final 
decision is adverse to the registrant, a registration to the applicant 
will not be authorized so long as the interfering registration remains 
on the register.

Sec. 2.98  Adding party to interference.

    A party may be added to an interference only upon petition to the 
Commissioner by that party. If an application which is or might be the 
subject of a petition for addition to an interference is not added, the 
examiner may suspend action on the application pending termination of 
the interference proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 2.99  Application to register as concurrent user.

    (a) An application for registration as a lawful concurrent user will 
be examined in the same manner as other applications for registration.
    (b) When it is determined that the mark is ready for publication, 
the applicant may be required to furnish as many copies of his 
application, specimens and drawing as may be necessary for the 
preparation of notices for each applicant, registrant or user specified 
as a concurrent user in the application for registration.
    (c) Upon receipt of the copies required by paragraph (b) of this 
section, the examiner shall forward the application for concurrent use 
registration for publication in the Official Gazette as provided by 
Sec. 2.80. If no opposition is filed, or if all oppositions that are 
filed are dismissed or withdrawn, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board 
shall prepare a notice for the applicant for concurrent use registration 
and for each applicant, registrant or user specified as a concurrent 
user in the application. The notices for the specified parties shall 
state the name and address of the applicant and of the applicant's 
attorney or other authorized representative, if any, together with the 
serial number and filing date of the application.
    (d)(1) The notices shall be sent to each applicant, in care of his 
attorney or other authorized representative, if any, to each user, and 
to each registrant. A copy of the application shall be forwarded with 
the notice to each party specified in the application.

[[Page 289]]

    (2) An answer to the notice is not required in the case of an 
applicant or registrant whose application or registration is specified 
as a concurrent user in the application, but a statement, if desired, 
may be filed within forty days after the mailing of the notice; in the 
case of any other party specified as a concurrent user in the 
application, an answer must be filed within forty days after the mailing 
of the notice.
    (3) If an answer, when required, is not filed, judgment will be 
entered precluding the specified user from claiming any right more 
extensive than that acknowledged in the application(s) for concurrent 
use registration, but the applicant(s) will remain with the burden of 
proving entitlement to registration(s).
    (e) The applicant for a concurrent use registration has the burden 
of proving entitlement thereto. If there are two or more applications 
for concurrent use registration involved in a proceeding, the party 
whose application has the latest filing date is the junior party. A 
party whose application has a filing date between the filing dates of 
the earliest involved application and the latest involved application is 
a junior party to every party whose involved application has an earlier 
filing date. If any applications have the same filing date, the 
application with the latest date of execution will be deemed to have the 
latest filing date and that applicant will be the junior party. A person 
specified as an excepted user in a concurrent use application but who 
has not filed an application shall be considered a party senior to every 
party that has an application involved in the proceeding.
    (f) When a concurrent use registration is sought on the basis that a 
court of competent jurisdiction has finally determined that the parties 
are entitled to use the same or similar marks in commerce, a concurrent 
use registration proceeding will not be instituted if all of the 
following conditions are fulfilled:
    (1) The applicant is entitled to registration subject only to the 
concurrent lawful use of a party to the court proceeding; and
    (2) The court decree specifies the rights of the parties; and
    (3) A true copy of the court decree is submitted to the examiner; 
and
    (4) The concurrent use application complies fully and exactly with 
the court decree; and
    (5) The excepted use specified in the concurrent use application 
does not involve a registration, or any involved registration has been 
restricted by the Commissioner in accordance with the court decree.

If any of the conditions specified in this paragraph is not satisfied, a 
concurrent use registration proceeding shall be prepared and instituted 
as provided in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
    (g) Registrations and applications to register on the Supplemental 
Register and registrations under the Act of 1920 are not subject to 
concurrent use registration proceedings. Applications to register under 
section 1(b) of the Act of 1946 are subject to concurrent use 
registration proceedings only after an acceptable amendment to allege 
use under Sec. 2.76 or statement of use under Sec. 2.88 has been filed.
    (h) The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will consider and determine 
concurrent use rights only in the context of a concurrent use 
registration proceeding.

<R05>
Sec. 2.101  Filing an opposition.

    (a) An opposition proceeding is commenced by the filing of an 
opposition in the Patent and Trademark Office.
    (b) Any entity which believes that it would be damaged by the 
registration of a mark on the Principal Register may oppose the same by 
filing an opposition, which should be addressed to the Trademark Trial 
and Appeal Board. The opposition need not be verified, and may be signed 
by the opposer or the opposer's attorney or other authorized 
representative.

[[Page 290]]

    (c) The opposition must be filed within thirty days after 
publication (Sec. 2.80) of the application being opposed or within an 
extension of time (Sec. 2.102) for filing an opposition.
    (d)(1) The opposition must be accompanied by the required fee for 
each party joined as opposer for each class in the application for which 
registration is opposed (see Sec. 2.6). If no fee, or a fee insufficient 
to pay for one person to oppose the registration of a mark in at least 
one class, is submitted within thirty days after publication of the mark 
to be opposed or within an extension of time for filing an opposition, 
the opposition will not be refused if the required fee(s) is submitted 
to the Patent and Trademark Office within the time limit set in the 
notification of this defect by the Office.
    (2) If the fees submitted are sufficient to pay for one person to 
oppose registration in at least one class but are insufficient for an 
opposition against all of the classes in the application, and the 
particular class or classes against which the opposition is filed are 
not specified, the Office will issue a written notice allowing opposer 
until a set time in which to submit the required fee(s) or to specify 
the class or classes opposed. If the required fee(s) is not submitted, 
or the specification made, within the time set in the notice, the 
opposition will be presumed to be against the class or classes in 
ascending order, beginning with the lowest numbered class and including 
the number of classes in the application for which the fees submitted 
are sufficient to pay the fee due for each class.
    (3) If persons are joined as party opposers, and the fees submitted 
are sufficient to pay for one person to oppose registration in at least 
one class but are insufficient for each named party opposer, the Office 
will issue a written notice allowing the named party opposers until a 
set time in which to submit the required fee(s) or to specify the 
opposer(s) to which the submitted fees apply. If the required fee(s) is 
not submitted, or the specification made, within the time set in the 
notice, the first named party will be presumed to be the party opposer 
and additional parties will be deemed to be party opposers to the extent 
that the fees submitted are sufficient to pay the fee due for each party 
opposer. If persons are joined as party opposers against the 
registration of a mark in more than one class, the fees submitted are 
insufficient, and no specification of opposers and classes is made 
within the time set in the written notice issued by the Office, the fees 
submitted will be applied first on behalf of the first-named opposer 
against as many of the classes in the application as the submitted fees 
are sufficient to pay, and any excess will be applied on behalf of the 
second-named party to the opposition against the classes in the 
application in ascending order.

<R05>
Sec. 2.102  Extension of time for filing an opposition.

    (a) Any person who believes that he would be damaged by the 
registration of a mark on the Principal Register may file a written 
request to extend the time for filing an opposition. The written request 
may be signed by the potential opposer or by an attorney at law or other 
person authorized, in accordance with Sec. 2.12 (b) and (c) and 
Sec. 2.17(b), to represent the potential opposer.
    (b) The written request to extend the time for filing an opposition 
must identify the potential opposer with reasonable certainty. Any 
opposition filed during an extension of time should be in the name of 
the person to whom the extension was granted, but an opposition may be 
accepted if the person in whose name the extension was requested was 
misidentified through mistake or if the opposition is filed in the name 
of a person in privity with the person who requested and was granted the 
extension of time.
    (c) The written request to extend the time for filing an opposition 
must be filed in the Patent and Trademark Office before the expiration 
of thirty days from the date of publication or within any extension of 
time previously granted, should specify the period of extension desired, 
and should be addressed to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. A first 
extension of time for not more

[[Page 291]]

than thirty days will be granted upon request. Further extensions of 
time may be granted by the Board for good cause. In addition, extensions 
of time to file an opposition aggregating more than 120 days from the 
date of publication of the application will not be granted except upon 
(1) a written consent or stipulation signed by the applicant or its 
authorized representative, or (2) a written request by the potential 
opposer or its authorized representative stating that the applicant or 
its authorized representative has consented to the request, or (3) a 
showing of extraordinary circumstances, it being considered that a 
potential opposer has an adequate alternative remedy by a petition for 
cancellation.
    (d) Every request to extend the time for filing a notice of 
opposition should be submitted in triplicate.

<R05>
Sec. 2.104  Contents of opposition.

    (a) The opposition must set forth a short and plain statement 
showing why the opposer believes it would be damaged by the registration 
of the opposed mark and state the grounds for opposition. A duplicate 
copy of the opposition, including exhibits, shall be filed with the 
opposition.
    (b) Oppositions to different applications owned by the same party 
may be joined in a consolidated opposition when appropriate, but the 
required fee must be included for each party joined as opposer for each 
class in which registration is opposed in each application against which 
the opposition is filed.

Sec. 2.105  Notification of opposition proceeding(s).

    When an opposition in proper form has been filed and the correct 
fee(s) have been submitted, a notification shall be prepared by the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, which shall identify the title and 
number of the proceeding and the application involved and shall 
designate a time, not less than thirty days from the mailing date of the 
notification, within which an answer must be filed. A copy of the 
notification shall be forwarded to the attorney or other authorized 
representative of the opposer, if any, or to the opposer. The duplicate 
copy of the opposition and exhibits shall be forwarded with a copy of 
the notification to the attorney or other authorized representative of 
the applicant, if any, or to the applicant.

<R05>
Sec. 2.106  Answer.

    (a) If no answer is filed within the time set, the opposition may be 
decided as in case of default.
    (b)(1) An answer shall state in short and plain terms the 
applicant's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the 
averments upon which the opposer relies. If the applicant is without 
knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of 
an averment, applicant shall so state and this will have the effect of a 
denial. Denials may take any of the forms specified in Rule 8(b) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. An answer may contain any defense, 
including the affirmative defenses of unclean hands, laches, estoppel, 
acquiescence, fraud, mistake, prior judgment, or any other matter 
constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When pleading special 
matters, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be followed. A reply 
to an affirmative defense need not be filed. When a defense attacks the 
validity of a registration pleaded in the opposition, paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section shall govern. A pleaded registration is a registration 
identified by number and date of issuance in an original notice of 
opposition or in any amendment thereto made under Rule 15, Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure.
    (2)(i) A defense attacking the validity of any one or more of the 
registrations pleaded in the opposition shall be a compulsory 
counterclaim if grounds for such counterclaim exist at the time when the 
answer is filed. If grounds for a counterclaim are known to the 
applicant when the answer to the opposition is filed, the counterclaim 
shall be pleaded with or as part of the answer. If grounds for a 
counterclaim are learned during the course of the opposition proceeding, 
the counterclaim shall be pleaded promptly after the grounds therefor 
are learned. A counterclaim

[[Page 292]]

need not be filed if it is the subject of another proceeding between the 
same parties or anyone in privity therewith.
    (ii) An attack on the validity of a registration pleaded by an 
opposer will not be heard unless a counterclaim or separate petition is 
filed to seek the cancellation of such registration.
    (iii) The provisions of Secs. 2.111 through 2.115, inclusive, shall 
be applicable to counterclaims. A time, not less than thirty days, will 
be designated within which an answer to the counterclaim must be filed.
    (iv) The times for pleading, discovery, testimony, briefs or oral 
argument will be reset or extended when necessary, upon motion by a 
party, to enable a party fully to present or meet a counterclaim or 
separate petition for cancellation of a registration.
    (c) The opposition may be withdrawn without prejudice before the 
answer is filed. After the answer is filed, the opposition may not be 
withdrawn without prejudice except with the written consent of the 
applicant or the applicant's attorney or other authorized 
representative.

    Authority: Secs. 2.111 to 2.114 also issued under secs. 14, 17, 24, 
60 Stat. 433, 434, 436; 15 U.S.C. 1064, 1067, 1092.


<R05>
Sec. 2.111  Filing petition for cancellation.

    (a) A cancellation proceeding is commenced by the timely filing of a 
petition for cancellation, together with the required fee, in the Patent 
and Trademark Office.
    (b) Any entity which believes that it is or will be damaged by a 
registration may file a petition, which should be addressed to the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, to cancel the registration in whole or 
in part. The petition need not be verified, and may be signed by the 
petitioner or the petitioner's attorney or other authorized 
representative. The petition may be filed at any time in the case of 
registrations on the Supplemental Register or under the Act of 1920, or 
registrations under the Act of 1881 or the Act of 1905 which have not 
been published under section 12(c) of the Act, or on any ground 
specified in section 14(3) or (5) of the Act. In all other cases the 
petition and the required fee must be filed within five years from the 
date of registration of the mark under the Act or from the date of 
publication under section 12(c) of the Act.
    (c)(1) The petition must be accompanied by the required fee for each 
class in the registration for which cancellation is sought (see 
Sec. 2.6). If the fee submitted is insufficient for a cancellation 
against all of the classes in the registration, and the particular class 
or classes against which the cancellation is filed are not specified, 
the Office will issue a written notice allowing petitioner a set time in 
which to submit the required fees(s) (provided that the five-year 
period, if applicable, has not expired) or to specify the class or 
classes sought to be cancelled. If the required fee(s) is not submitted, 
or the specification made, within the time set in the notice, the 
cancellation will be presumed to be against the class or classes in 
ascending order, beginning with the lowest numbered class, and including 
the number of classes in the registration for which the fees submitted 
are sufficient to pay the fee due for each class.
    (2) If persons are joined as party petitioners, each must submit a 
fee for each class for which cancellation is sought. If the fees 
submitted are insufficient for each named party petitioner, the Office 
will issue a written notice allowing the named party petitioners until a 
set time in which to submit the required fee(s) (provided that the five-
year period, if applicable, has not expired) or to specify the 
petitioner(s) to which the submitted fees apply. If the required fee(s) 
is not submitted, or the specification made, within the time set in the 
notice, the first named party will be presumed to

[[Page 293]]

be the party petitioner and additional parties will be deemed to be 
party petitioners to the extent that the fees submitted are sufficient 
to pay the fee due for each party petitioner. If persons are joined as 
party petitioners against a registration sought to be cancelled in more 
than one class, the fees submitted are insufficient, and no 
specification of parties and classes is made within the time set in the 
written notice issued by the Office, the fees submitted will be applied 
first on behalf of the first-named petitioner against as many of the 
classes in the registration as the submitted fees are sufficient to pay, 
and any excess will be applied on behalf of the second-named party to 
the petition against the classes in the registration in ascending order.
    (3) The filing date of the petition is the date of receipt in the 
Patent and Trademark Office of the petition together with the required 
fee. If the amount of the fee filed with the petition is sufficient to 
pay for at least one person to petition to cancel one class of goods or 
services but is less than the required amount because multiple party 
petitioners and/or multiple classes in the registration for which 
cancellation is sought are involved, and the required additional amount 
of the fee is filed within the time limit set in the notification of the 
defect by the Office, the filing date of the petition with respect to 
the additional party petitioners and/or classes is the date of receipt 
in the Patent and Trademark Office of the additional fees.

<R05>
Sec. 2.112  Contents of petition for cancellation.

    (a) The petition to cancel must set forth a short and plain 
statement showing why the petitioner believes it is or will be damaged 
by the registration, state the grounds for cancellation, and indicate, 
to the best of petitioner's knowledge, the name and address of the 
current owner of the registration. A duplicate copy of the petition, 
including exhibits, shall be filed with the petition.
    (b) Petitions to cancel different registrations owned by the same 
party may be joined in a consolidated petition when appropriate, but the 
required fee must be included for each party joined as petitioner for 
each class sought to be cancelled in each registration against which the 
petition to cancel is filed.

<R05>
Sec. 2.113  Notification of cancellation proceeding.

    When a petition for cancellation has been filed in proper form (see 
Secs. 2.111 and 2.112), a notification shall be prepared by the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, which shall identify the title and 
number of the proceeding and the registration or registrations involved 
and shall designate a time, not less than thirty days from the mailing 
date of the notification, within which an answer must be filed. A copy 
of the notification shall be forwarded to the attorney or other 
authorized representative of the petitioner, if any, or to the 
petitioner. The duplicate copy of the petition for cancellation and 
exhibits shall be forwarded with a copy of the notification to the 
respondent (see Sec. 2.118), who shall be the party shown by the records 
of the Patent and Trademark Office to be the current owner of the 
registration or registrations sought to be cancelled, except that the 
Board, in its discretion, may join or substitute as respondent a party 
who makes a showing of a current ownership interest in such registration 
or registrations. When the party identified by the petitioner, pursuant 
to Sec. 2.112(a), as the current owner of the registration or 
registrations is not the record owner thereof, a courtesy copy of the 
petition for cancellation shall be forwarded with a copy of the 
notification to the alleged current owner, which may file a motion to be 
joined or substituted as respondent. If the petition is found to be 
defective as to form, the party filing the petition shall be so advised 
and allowed a reasonable time for correcting the informality.

    (a) If no answer is filed within the time set, the petition may be 
decided as in case of default.
    (b)(1) An answer shall state in short and plain terms the 
respondent's defenses to each claim asserted and shall admit or deny the 
averments upon which the petitioner relies. If the respondent is without 
knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of 
an averment, respondent shall so state and this will have the effect of 
a denial. Denials may take any of the forms specified in Rule 8(b) of 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. An answer may contain any defense, 
including the affirmative defenses of unclean hands, laches, estoppel, 
acquiescence, fraud, mistake, prior judgment, or any other matter 
constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense. When pleading special 
matters, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be followed. A reply 
to an affirmative defense need not be filed. When a defense attacks the 
validity of a registration pleaded in the petition, paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section shall govern. A pleaded registration is a registration 
identified by number and date of issuance in an original petition for 
cancellation or in any amendment thereto made under Rule 15, Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (2)(i) A defense attacking the validity of any one or more of the 
registrations pleaded in the petition shall be a compulsory counterclaim 
if grounds for such counterclaim exist at the time when the answer if 
filed. If grounds for a counterclaim are known to respondent when the 
answer to the petition is filed, the counterclaim shall be pleaded with 
or as part of the answer. If grounds for a counterclaim are learned 
during the course of the cancellation proceeding, the counterclaim shall 
be pleaded promptly after the grounds therefor are learned. A 
counterclaim need not be filed if it is the subject of another 
proceeding between the same parties or anyone in privity therewith.
    (ii) An attack on the validity of a registration pleaded by a

before the answer is filed. After the answer is filed, the petition may 
not be withdrawn without prejudice except with the written consent of 
the registrant or the registrant's attorney or other authorized 
representative.

    (5) Transmission by overnight courier.

Whenever it shall be satisfactorily shown to the Commissioner that none 
of the above modes of obtaining service or serving the paper is 
practicable, service may be by notice published in the Official Gazette.
    (c) When service is made by first-class mail, ``Express Mail,'' or 
overnight courier, the date of mailing or of delivery to the overnight 
courier will be considered the date of service. Whenever a party is 
required to take some action within a prescribed period after the 
service of a paper upon the

[[Page 296]]

party by another party and the paper is served by first-class mail, 
``Express Mail,'' or overnight courier, 5 days shall be added to the 
prescribed period.
    (d) If a party to an inter partes proceeding is not domiciled in the 
United States and is not represented by an attorney or other authorized 
representative located in the United States, the party must designate by 
written document filed in the Patent and Trademark Office the name and 
address of a person resident in the United States on whom may be served 
notices or process in the proceeding. In such cases, official 
communications of the Patent and Trademark Office will be addressed to 
the domestic representative unless the proceeding is being prosecuted by 
an attorney at law or other qualified person duly authorized under 
Sec. 10.14(c) of this subchapter. The mere designation of a domestic 
representative does not authorize the person designated to prosecute the 
proceeding unless qualified under Sec. 10.14(a), or qualified under 
Sec. 10.14(b) and authorized under Sec. 2.17(b).
    (e) Every paper filed in an inter partes proceeding, and every 
request for an extension of time to file an opposition, must be signed 
by the party filing it, or by the party's attorney or other authorized 
representative, but an unsigned paper will not be refused consideration 
if a signed copy is submitted to the Patent and Trademark Office within 
the time limit set in the notification of this defect by the Office.

Sec. 2.120  Discovery.

    (a) In general. Wherever appropriate, the provisions of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery shall apply in 
opposition, cancellation, interference and concurrent use registration 
proceedings except as otherwise provided in this section. The provisions 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to automatic 
disclosure, scheduling conferences, conferences to discuss settlement 
and to develop a discovery plan, and transmission to the court of a 
written report outlining the discovery plan, are not applicable to Board 
proceedings. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will specify the 
opening and closing dates for the taking of discovery. The trial order 
setting these dates will be mailed with the notice of institution of the 
proceeding. The discovery period will be set for a period of 180 days. 
The parties may stipulate to a shortening of the discovery period. The 
discovery period may be extended upon stipulation of the parties 
approved by the Board, or upon motion granted by the Board, or by order 
of the Board. If a motion for an extension is denied, the discovery 
period may remain as originally set or as reset. Discovery depositions 
must be taken, and interrogatories, requests for production of documents 
and things, and requests for admission must be served, on or before the 
closing date of the discovery period as originally set or as reset. 
Responses to interrogatories, requests for production of documents and 
things, and requests for admission must be served within 30 days from 
the date of service of such discovery requests. The time to respond may 
be extended upon stipulation of the parties, or upon motion granted by 
the Board, or by order of the Board. The resetting of a party's time to 
respond to an outstanding request for discovery will not result in the 
automatic rescheduling of the discovery and/or testimony periods; such 
dates will be rescheduled only upon stipulation of the parties approved 
by the Board, or upon motion granted by the Board, or by order of the 
Board.
    (b) Discovery deposition within the United States. The deposition of 
a natural person shall be taken in the Federal judicial district where 
the person resides or is regularly employed or at any place on which the 
parties agree by stipulation. The responsibility rests wholly with the 
party taking discovery to secure the attendance of a proposed deponent 
other than a party or anyone who, at the time set for the taking of the 
deposition, is an officer, director, or managing agent of a party, or a 
person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or Rule 31(a) of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure. See 35 U.S.C. 24.
    (c) Discovery deposition in foreign countries. (1) The discovery 
deposition of a natural person residing in a foreign country who is a 
party or who, at

[[Page 297]]

the time set for the taking of the deposition, is an officer, director, 
or managing agent of a party, or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) 
or Rule 31(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, shall, if taken 
in a foreign country, be taken in the manner prescribed by Sec. 2.124 
unless the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, upon motion for good cause, 
orders or the parties stipulate, that the deposition be taken by oral 
examination.
    (2) Whenever a foreign party is or will be, during a time set for 
discovery, present within the United States or any territory which is 
under the control and jurisdiction of the United States, such party may 
be deposed by oral examination upon notice by the party seeking 
discovery. Whenever a foreign party has or will have, during a time set 
for discovery, an officer, director, managing agent, or other person who 
consents to testify on its behalf, present within the United States or 
any territory which is under the control and jurisdiction of the United 
States, such officer, director, managing agent, or other person who 
consents to testify in its behalf may be deposed by oral examination 
upon notice by the party seeking discovery. The party seeking discovery 
may have one or more officers, directors, managing agents, or other 
persons who consent to testify on behalf of the adverse party, 
designated under Rule 30(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
The deposition of a person under this paragraph shall be taken in the 
Federal judicial district where the witness resides or is regularly 
employed, or, if the witness neither resides nor is regularly employed 
in a Federal judicial district, where the witness is at the time of the 
deposition. This paragraph does not preclude the taking of a discovery 
deposition of a foreign party by any other procedure provided by 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Interrogatories; request for production. (1) The total number of 
written interrogatories which a party may serve upon another party 
pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in a 
proceeding, shall not exceed seventy-five, counting subparts, except 
that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, in its discretion, may allow 
additional interrogatories upon motion therefor showing good cause, or 
upon stipulation of the parties. A motion for leave to serve additional 
interrogatories must be filed and granted prior to the service of the 
proposed additional interrogatories; and must be accompanied by a copy 
of the interrogatories, if any, which have already been served by the 
moving party, and by a copy of the interrogatories proposed to be 
served. If a party upon which interrogatories have been served believes 
that the number of interrogatories served exceeds the limitation 
specified in this paragraph, and is not willing to waive this basis for 
objection, the party shall, within the time for (and instead of) serving 
answers and specific objections to the interrogatories, serve a general 
objection on the ground of their excessive number. If the inquiring 
party, in turn, files a motion to compel discovery, the motion must be 
accompanied by a copy of the set(s) of interrogatories which together 
are said to exceed the limitation, and must otherwise comply with the 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) The production of documents and things under the provisions of 
Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will be made at the 
place where the documents and things are usually kept, or where the 
parties agree, or where and in the manner which the Trademark Trial and 
Appeal Board, upon motion, orders.
    (e) Motion for an order to compel discovery. (1) If a party fails to 
designate a person pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6) or Rule 31(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or if a party, or such designated 
person, or an officer, director or managing agent of a party fails to 
attend a deposition or fails to answer any question propounded in a 
discovery deposition, or any interrogatory, or fails to produce and 
permit the inspection and copying of any document or thing, the party 
seeking discovery may file a motion before the Trademark Trial and 
Appeal Board for an order to compel a designation, or attendance at a 
deposition, or an answer, or production and an opportunity to inspect 
and copy. The motion must be filed prior to

[[Page 298]]

the commencement of the first testimony period as originally set or as 
reset. The motion shall include a copy of the request for designation or 
of the relevant portion of the discovery deposition; or a copy of the 
interrogatory with any answer or objection that was made; or a copy of 
the request for production, any proffer of production or objection to 
production in response to the request, and a list and brief description 
of the documents or things that were not produced for inspection and 
copying. The motion must be supported by a written statement from the 
moving party that such party or the attorney therefor has made a good 
faith effort, by conference or correspondence, to resolve with the other 
party or the attorney therefor the issues presented in the motion and 
has been unable to reach agreement. If issues raised in the motion are 
subsequently resolved by agreement of the parties, the moving party 
should inform the Board in writing of the issues in the motion which no 
longer require adjudication.
    (2) When a party files a motion for an order to compel discovery, 
the case will be suspended by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board with 
respect to all matters not germane to the motion, and no party should 
file any paper which is not germane to the motion, except as otherwise 
specified in the Board's suspension order. The filing of a motion to 
compel shall not toll the time for a party to respond to any outstanding 
discovery requests or to appear for any noticed discovery deposition.
    (f) Motion for a protective order. Upon motion by a party from whom 
discovery is sought, and for good cause, the Trademark Trial and Appeal 
Board may make any order which justice requires to protect a party from 
annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, 
including one or more of the types of orders provided by clauses (1) 
through (8), inclusive, of Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in 
part, the Board may, on such conditions (other than an award of expenses 
to the party prevailing on the motion) as are just, order that any party 
provide or permit discovery.
    (g) Sanctions. (1) If a party fails to comply with an order of the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board relating to discovery, including a 
protective order, the Board may make any appropriate order, including 
any of the orders provided in Rule 37(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, except that the Board will not hold any person in 
contempt or award any expenses to any party. The Board may impose 
against a party any of the sanctions provided by this subsection in the 
event that said party or any attorney, agent, or designated witness of 
that party fails to comply with a protective order made pursuant to Rule 
26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (2) If a party, or an officer, director, or managing agent of a 
party, or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to testify on behalf of a party, fails 
to attend the party's or person's discovery deposition, after being 
served with proper notice, or fails to provide any response to a set of 
interrogatories or to a set of requests for production of documents and 
things, and such party or the party's attorney or other authorized 
representative informs the party seeking discovery that no response will 
be made thereto, the Board may make any appropriate order, as specified 
in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
    (h)(1) Any motion by a party to determine the sufficiency of an 
answer or objection to a request made by that party for an admission 
must be filed prior to the commencement of the first testimony period, 
as originally set or as reset. The motion shall include a copy of the 
request for admission and any exhibits thereto and of the answer or 
objection. The motion must be supported by a written statement from the 
moving party that such party or the attorney therefor has made a good 
faith effort, by conference or correspondence, to resolve with the other 
party or the attorney therefor the issues presented in the motion and 
has been unable to reach agreement. If issues raised in the motion are 
subsequently resolved by agreement of the

[[Page 299]]

parties, the moving party should inform the Board in writing of the 
issues in the motion which no longer require adjudication.
    (2) When a party files a motion to determine the sufficiency of an 
answer or objection to a request made by that party for an admission, 
the case will be suspended by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board with 
respect to all matters not germane to the motion, and no party should 
file any paper which is not germane to the motion, except as otherwise 
specified in the Board's suspension order. The filing of a motion to 
determine the sufficiency of an answer or objection to a request for 
admission shall not toll the time for a party to respond to any 
outstanding discovery requests or to appear for any noticed discovery 
deposition.
    (i) Telephone and pre-trial conferences. (1) Whenever it appears to 
the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that a motion filed in an inter 
partes proceeding is of such nature that its resolution by 
correspondence is not practical, the Board may, upon its own initiative 
or upon request made by one or both of the parties, resolve the motion 
by telephone conference.
    (2) Whenever it appears to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that 
questions or issues arising during the interlocutory phase of an inter 
partes proceeding have become so complex that their resolution by 
correspondence or telephone conference is not practical and that 
resolution would be likely to be facilitated by a conference in person 
of the parties or their attorneys with a Member or Attorney-Examiner of 
the Board, the Board may, upon its own initiative or upon motion made by 
one or both of the parties, request that the parties or their attorneys, 
under circumstances which will not result in undue hardship for any 
party, meet with the Board at its offices for a pre-trial conference.
    (j) Use of discovery deposition, answer to interrogatory, or 
admission. (1) The discovery deposition of a party or of anyone who at 
the time of taking the deposition was on officer, director or managing 
agent of a party, or a person designated by a party pursuant to Rule 
30(b)(6) or Rule 31(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, may be 
offered in evidence by an adverse party.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the 
discovery deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, shall not be 
offered in evidence unless the person whose deposition was taken is, 
during the testimony period of the party offering the deposition, dead; 
or out of the United States (unless it appears that the absence of the 
witness was procured by the party offering the deposition); or unable to 
testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or cannot 
be served with a subpoena to compel attendance at a testimonial 
deposition; or there is a stipulation by the parties; or upon a showing 
that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in 
the interest of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. The use of 
a discovery deposition by any party under this paragraph will be allowed 
only by stipulation of the parties approved by the Trademark Trial and 
Appeal Board, or by order of the Board on motion, which shall be filed 
at the time of the purported offer of the deposition in evidence, unless 
the motion is based upon a claim that such exceptional circumstances 
exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice, to allow the 
deposition to be used, in which case the motion shall be filed promptly 
after the circumstances claimed to justify use of the deposition became 
known.
    (3)(i) A discovery deposition, an answer to an interrogatory, or an 
admission to a request for admission, which may be offered in evidence 
under the provisions of paragraph (j) of this section may be made of 
record in the case by filing the deposition or any part thereof with any 
exhibit to the part that is filed, or a copy of the interrogatory and 
answer thereto with any exhibit made part of the answer, or a copy of 
the request for admission and any exhibit thereto and the admission (or 
a statement that the party from which an admission was requested failed 
to respond thereto), together with a notice of reliance. The notice of 
reliance and the material submitted thereunder should be filed during 
the testimony period of the party which

[[Page 300]]

files the notice of reliance. An objection made at a discovery 
deposition by a party answering a question subject to the objection will 
be considered at final hearing.
    (ii) A party which has obtained documents from another party under 
Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may not make the 
documents of record by notice of reliance alone, except to the extent 
that they are admissible by notice of reliance under the provisions of 
Sec. 2.122(e).
    (4) If only part of a discovery deposition is submitted and made 
part of the record by a party, an adverse party may introduce under a 
notice of reliance any other part of the deposition which should in 
fairness be considered so as to make not misleading what was offered by 
the submitting party. A notice of reliance filed by an adverse party 
must be supported by a written statement explaining why the adverse 
party needs to rely upon each additional part listed in the adverse 
party's notice, failing which the Board, in its discretion, may refuse 
to consider the additional parts.
    (5) An answer to an interrogatory, or an admission to a request for 
admission, may be submitted and made part of the record by only the 
inquiring party except that, if fewer than all of the answers to 
interrogatories, or fewer than all of the admissions, are offered in 
evidence by the inquiring party, the responding party may introduce 
under a notice of reliance any other answers to interrogatories, or any 
other admissions, which should in fairness be considered so as to make 
not misleading what was offered by the inquiring party. The notice of 
reliance filed by the responding party must be supported by a written 
statement explaining why the responding party needs to rely upon each of 
the additional discovery responses listed in the responding party's 
notice, failing which the Board, in its discretion, may refuse to 
consider the additional responses.
    (6) Paragraph (j) of this section will not be interpreted to 
preclude the reading or the use of a discovery deposition, or answer to 
an interrogatory, or admission as part of the examination or cross-
examination of any witness during the testimony period of any party.
    (7) When a discovery deposition, or a part thereof, or an answer to 
an interrogatory, or an admission, has been made of record by one party 
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (j)(3) of this section, 
it may be referred to by any party for any purpose permitted by the 
Federal Rules of Evidence.
    (8) Requests for discovery, responses thereto, and materials or 
depositions obtained through the discovery process should not be filed 
with the Board except when submitted with a motion relating to 
discovery, or in support of or response to a motion for summary 
judgment, or under a notice of reliance during a party's testimony 
period. Papers or materials filed in violation of this paragraph may be 
returned by the Board.

Sec. 2.121  Assignment of times for taking testimony.

    (a)(1) The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will issue a trial order 
assigning to each party the time for taking testimony. No testimony 
shall be taken except during the times assigned, unless by stipulation 
of the parties approved by the Board, or, upon motion, by order of the 
Board. Testimony periods may be rescheduled by stipulation of the 
parties approved by the Board, or upon motion granted by the Board, or 
by order of the Board. If a motion to reschedule testimony periods is 
denied, the testimony periods may remain as set. The resetting of the 
closing date for discovery will result in the rescheduling of the 
testimony periods without action by any party.
    (2) The initial trial order will be mailed by the Board after issue 
is joined.
    (b)(1) The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will schedule a 
testimony period for the plaintiff to present its case in chief, a 
testimony period for the defendant to present its case and to meet the 
case of the plaintiff, and a

[[Page 301]]

testimony period for the plaintiff to present evidence in rebuttal.
    (2) When there is a counterclaim, or when proceedings have been 
consolidated and one party is in the position of plaintiff in one of the 
involved proceedings and in the position of defendant in another of the 
involved proceedings, or when there is an interference or a concurrent 
use registration proceeding involving more than two parties, the Board 
will schedule testimony periods so that each party in the position of 
plaintiff will have a period for presenting its case in chief against 
each party in the position of defendant, each party in the position of 
defendant will have a period for presenting its case and meeting the 
case of each plaintiff, and each party in the position of plaintiff will 
have a period for presenting evidence in rebuttal.
    (c) A testimony period which is solely for rebuttal will be set for 
fifteen days. All other testimony periods will be set for thirty days. 
The periods may be extended by stipulation of the parties approved by 
the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or upon motion granted by the 
Board, or by order of the Board. If a motion for an extension is denied, 
the testimony periods may remain as set.
    (d) When parties stipulate to the rescheduling of testimony periods 
or to the rescheduling of the closing date for discovery and the 
rescheduling of testimony periods, a stipulation presented in the form 
used in a trial order, signed by the parties, or a motion in said form 
signed by one party and including a statement that every other party has 
agreed thereto, and submitted in a number of copies equal to the number 
of parties to the proceeding plus one copy for the Board, will, if 
approved, be so stamped, signed, and dated, and a copy will be promptly 
returned to each of the parties.

<R05>
Sec. 2.122  Matters in evidence.

    (a) Rules of evidence. The rules of evidence for proceedings before 
the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board are the Federal Rules of Evidence, 
the relevant provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the 
relevant provisions of Title 28 of the United States Code, and the 
provisions of this part of title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) Application files. (1) The file of each application or 
registration specified in a notice of interference, of each application 
or registration specified in the notice of a concurrent use registration 
proceeding, of the application against which a notice of opposition is 
filed, or of each registration against which a petition or counterclaim 
for cancellation is filed forms part of the record of the proceeding 
without any action by the parties and reference may be made to the file 
for any relevant and competent purpose.
    (2) The allegation in an application for registration, or in a 
registration, of a date of use is not evidence on behalf of the 
applicant or registrant; a date of use of a mark must be established by 
competent evidence. Specimens in the file of an application for 
registration, or in the file of a registration, are not evidence on 
behalf of the applicant or registrant unless identified and introduced 
in evidence as exhibits during the period for the taking of testimony.
    (c) Exhibits to pleadings. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section, an exhibit attached to a pleading is not evidence on 
behalf of the party to whose pleading the exhibit is attached unless 
identified and introduced in evidence as an exhibit during the period 
for the taking of testimony.
    (d) Registrations. (1) A registration of the opposer or petitioner 
pleaded in an opposition or petition to cancel will be received in 
evidence and made part of the record if the opposition or petition is 
accompanied by two copies (originals or photocopies) of the registration 
prepared and issued by the Patent and Trademark Office showing both the 
current status of and current title to the registration. For the cost of 
a copy of a registration showing status and title, see Sec. 2.6(b)(4).
    (2) A registration owned by any party to a proceeding may be made of 
record in the proceeding by that party by appropriate identification and 
introduction during the taking of testimony or by filing a notice of 
reliance, which shall be accompanied by a copy (original or photocopy) 
of the registration

[[Page 302]]

prepared and issued by the Patent and Trademark Office showing both the 
current status of and current title to the registration. The notice of 
reliance shall be filed during the testimony period of the party that 
files the notice.
    (e) Printed publications and official records. Printed publications, 
such as books and periodicals, available to the general public in 
libraries or of general circulation among members of the public or that 
segment of the public which is relevant under an issue in a proceeding, 
and official records, if the publication of official record is competent 
evidence and relevant to an issue, may be introduced in evidence by 
filing a notice of reliance on the material being offered. The notice 
shall specify the printed publication (including information sufficient 
to identify the source and the date of the publication) or the official 
record and the pages to be read; indicate generally the relevance of the 
material being offered; and be accompanied by the official record or a 
copy thereof whose authenticity is established under the Federal Rules 
of Evidence, or by the printed publication or a copy of the relevant 
portion thereof. A copy of an official record of the Patent and 
Trademark Office need not be certified to be offered in evidence. The 
notice of reliance shall be filed during the testimony period of the 
party that files the notice.
    (f) Testimony from other proceedings. By order of the Trademark 
Trial and Appeal Board, on motion, testimony taken in another 
proceeding, or testimony taken in a suit or action in a court, between 
the same parties or those in privity may be used in a proceeding, so far 
as relevant and material, subject, however, to the right of any adverse 
party to recall or demand the recall for examination or cross-
examination of any witness whose prior testimony has been offered and to 
rebut the testimony.

<R05>
Sec. 2.123  Trial testimony in inter partes cases.

    (a)(1) The testimony of witnesses in inter partes cases may be taken 
by depositions upon oral examination as provided by this section or by 
depositions upon written questions as provided by Sec. 2.124. If a party 
serves notice of the taking of a testimonial deposition upon written 
questions of a witness who is, or will be at the time of the deposition, 
present within the United States or any territory which is under the 
control and jurisdiction of the United States, any adverse party may, 
within fifteen days from the date of service of the notice, file a 
motion with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, for good cause, for an 
order that the deposition be taken by oral examination.
    (2) A testimonial deposition taken in a foreign country shall be 
taken by deposition upon written questions as provided by Sec. 2.124, 
unless the Board, upon motion for good cause, orders that the deposition 
be taken by oral examination, or the parties so stipulate.
    (b) Stipulations. If the parties so stipulate in writing, 
depositions may be taken before any person authorized to administer 
oaths, at any place, upon any notice, and in any manner, and when so 
taken may be used like other depositions. By written agreement of the 
parties, the testimony of any witness or witnesses of any party, may be 
submitted in the form of an affidavit by such witness or witnesses. The 
parties may stipulate in writing what a particular witness would testify 
to if called, or the facts in the case of any party may be stipulated in 
writing.
    (c) Notice of examination of witnesses. Before the depositions of 
witnesses shall be taken by a party, due notice in writing shall be 
given to the opposing party or parties, as provided in Sec. 2.119(b), of 
the time when and place where the depositions will be taken, of the 
cause or matter in which they are to be used, and the name and address 
of each witness to be examined; if the name of a witness is not known, a 
general description sufficient to identify the witness or the particular 
class or group to which the witness belongs, together with a 
satisfactory explanation, may be given instead. Depositions may be 
noticed for any reasonable time and place in the United States. A 
deposition may not be noticed for a place in

[[Page 303]]

a foreign country except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. No party shall take depositions in more than one place at the 
same time, nor so nearly at the same time that reasonable opportunity 
for travel from one place of examination to the other is not available.
    (d) Persons before whom depositions may be taken. Depositions may be 
taken before persons designated by Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure.
    (e) Examination of witnesses. (1) Each witness before testifying 
shall be duly sworn according to law by the officer before whom his 
deposition is to be taken.
    (2) The deposition shall be taken in answer to questions, with the 
questions and answers recorded in their regular order by the officer, or 
by some other person (who shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 28 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) in the presence of the officer 
except when the officer's presence is waived on the record by agreement 
of the parties. The testimony shall be taken stenographically and 
transcribed, unless the parties present agree otherwise. In the absence 
of all opposing parties and their attorneys or other authorized 
representatives, depositions may be taken in longhand, typewriting, or 
stenographically. Exhibits which are marked and identified at the 
deposition will be deemed to have been offered into evidence, without 
any formal offer thereof, unless the intention of the party marking the 
exhibits is clearly expressed to the contrary.
    (3) Every adverse party shall have full opportunity to cross-examine 
each witness. If the notice of examination of witnesses which is served 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section is improper or inadequate with 
respect to any witness, an adverse party may cross-examine that witness 
under protest while reserving the right to object to the receipt of the 
testimony in evidence. Promptly after the testimony is completed, the 
adverse party, if he wishes to preserve the objection, shall move to 
strike the testimony from the record, which motion will be decided on 
the basis of all of the relevant circumstances. A motion to strike the 
testimony of a witness for lack of proper or adequate notice of 
examination must request the exclusion of the entire testimony of that 
witness and not only a part of that testimony.
    (4) All objections made at the time of the examination to the 
qualifications of the officer taking the deposition, or to the manner of 
taking it, or to the evidence presented, or to the conduct of any party, 
and any other objection to the proceedings, shall be noted by the 
officer upon the deposition. Evidence objected to shall be taken subject 
to the objections.
    (5) When the deposition has been transcribed, the deposition shall 
be carefully read over by the witness or by the officer to him, and 
shall then be signed by the witness in the presence of any officer 
authorized to administer oaths unless the reading and the signature be 
waived on the record by agreement of all parties.
    (f) Certification and filing of deposition. (1) The officer shall 
annex to the deposition his certificate showing:
    (i) Due administration of the oath by the officer to the witness 
before the commencement of his deposition;
    (ii) The name of the person by whom the deposition was taken down, 
and whether, if not taken down by the officer, it was taken down in his 
presence;
    (iii) The presence or absence of the adverse party;
    (iv) The place, day, and hour of commencing and taking the 
deposition;
    (v) The fact that the officer was not disqualified as specified in 
Rule 28 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (2) If any of the foregoing requirements in paragraph (f)(1) of this 
section are waived, the certificate shall so state. The officer shall 
sign the certificate and affix thereto his seal of office, if he has 
such a seal. Unless waived on the record by an agreement, he shall then 
securely seal in an envelope all the evidence, notices, and paper 
exhibits, inscribe upon the envelope a certificate giving the number and 
title of the case, the name of each witness, and the date of sealing. 
The officer or the party taking the deposition, or its attorney or other 
authorized representative, shall then address the package, and forward 
the same to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. If the weight or 
bulk of an exhibit shall

[[Page 304]]

exclude it from the envelope, it shall, unless waived on the record by 
agreement of all parties, be authenticated by the officer and 
transmitted by the officer or the party taking the deposition, or its 
attorney or other authorized representative, in a separate package 
marked and addressed as provided in this section.
    (g) Form of deposition. (1) The pages of each deposition must be 
numbered consecutively, and the name of the witness plainly and 
conspicuously written at the top of each page. The deposition may be 
written on legal-size or letter-size paper, with a wide margin on the 
left-hand side of the page, and with the writing on one side only of the 
sheet. The questions propounded to each witness must be consecutively 
numbered unless paper with numbered lines is used, and each question 
must be followed by its answer.
    (2) Exhibits must be numbered or lettered consecutively and each 
must be marked with the number and title of the case and the name of the 
party offering the exhibit. Entry and consideration may be refused to 
improperly marked exhibits.
    (3) Each deposition must contain an index of the names of the 
witnesses, giving the pages where their examination and cross-
examination begin, and an index of the exhibits, briefly describing 
their nature and giving the pages at which they are introduced and 
offered in evidence.
    (h) Depositions must be filed. All depositions which are taken must 
be duly filed in the Patent and Trademark Office. On refusal to file, 
the Office at its discretion will not further hear or consider the 
contestant with whom the refusal lies; and the Office may, at its 
discretion, receive and consider a copy of the withheld deposition, 
attested by such evidence as is procurable.
    (i) Inspection of depositions. After the depositions are filed in 
the Office, they may be inspected by any party to the case, but they 
cannot be withdrawn for the purpose of printing. They may be printed by 
someone specially designated by the Office for that purpose, under 
proper restrictions.
    (j) Effect of errors and irregularities in depositions. Rule 32(d) 
(1), (2), and (3) (A) and (B) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
shall apply to errors and irregularities in depositions. Notice will not 
be taken of merely formal or technical objections which shall not appear 
to have wrought a substantial injury to the party raising them; and in 
case of such injury it must be made to appear that the objection was 
raised at the time specified in said rule.
    (k) Objections to admissibility: Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (j) of this section, objection may be made to receiving in 
evidence any deposition, or part thereof, or any other evidence, for any 
reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence from 
consideration. Objections to the competency of a witness or to the 
competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony must be raised at the 
time specified in Rule 32(d)(3)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Such objections will not be considered until final hearing.
    (l) Evidence not considered. Evidence not obtained and filed in 
compliance with these sections will not be considered.

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (b)(1) A party desiring to take a testimonial deposition upon 
written questions shall serve notice thereof upon each adverse party 
within ten days from the opening date of the testimony period of the

[[Page 305]]

is to be taken. If the name of the person is not known, a general 
description sufficient to identify him or the particular class or group 
to which he belongs shall be stated in the notice, and the party from 
whom the discovery deposition is to be taken shall designate one or more 
persons to be deposed in the same manner as is provided by Rule 30(b)(6) 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (c) Every notice given under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section shall be accompanied by the name or descriptive title of the 
officer before whom the deposition is to be taken.
    (d)(1) Every notice served on any adverse party under the provisions 
of paragraph (b) of this section shall be accompanied by the written 
questions to be propounded on behalf of the party who proposes to take 
the deposition. Within twenty days from the date of service of the 
notice, any adverse party may serve cross questions upon the party who 
proposes to take the deposition; any party who serves cross questions 
shall also serve every other adverse party. Within ten days from the 
date of service of the cross questions, the party who proposes to take 
the deposition may serve redirect questions on every adverse party. 
Within ten days from the date of service of the redirect questions, any 
party who served cross questions may serve recross questions upon the 
party who proposes to take the deposition; any party who serves recross 
questions shall also serve every other adverse party. Written objections 
to questions may be served on a party propounding questions; any party 
who objects shall serve a copy of the objections on every other adverse 
party. In response to objections, substitute questions may be served on 
the objecting party within ten days of the date of service of the 
objections; substitute questions shall be served on every other adverse 
party.
    (2) Upon motion for good cause by any party, or upon its own

of written notice that one or more testimonial depositions are to be 
taken upon written questions, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board shall 
suspend or reschedule other proceedings in the matter to allow for the 
orderly completion of the depositions upon written questions.
    (e) Within ten days after the last date when questions, objections, 
or substitute questions may be served, the party who proposes to take 
the deposition shall mail a copy of the notice and copies of all the 
questions to the officer designated in the notice; a copy of the notice 
and of all the questions mailed to the officer shall be served on every 
adverse party. The officer designated in the notice shall take the 
testimony of the witness in response to the questions and shall record 
each answer immediately after the corresponding question. The officer 
shall then certify the transcript and mail the transcript and exhibits 
to the party who took the deposition.
    (f) The party who took the deposition shall promptly serve a copy of 
the transcript, copies of documentary exhibits, and duplicates or 
photographs of physical exhibits on every adverse party. It is the 
responsibility of the party who takes the deposition to assure that the 
transcript is correct (see Sec. 2.125(b)). If the deposition is a 
discovery deposition, it may be made of record as provided by 
Sec. 2.120(j). If the deposition is a testimonial deposition, the 
original, together with copies of documentary exhibits and duplicates or 
photographs of physical exhibits, shall be filed promptly with the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.
    (g) Objections to questions and answers in depositions upon written 
questions may be considered at final hearing.

Sec. 2.125  Filing and service of testimony.

    (a) One copy of the transcript of testimony taken in accordance with 
Sec. 2.123, together with copies of documentary exhibits and duplicates 
or photographs of physical exhibits, shall be served on each adverse 
party within thirty days after completion of the taking of that 
testimony. If the transcript with exhibits is not served on each adverse 
party within thirty days or within an extension of time for the purpose, 
any adverse party which was not served may have remedy by way of

[[Page 306]]

a motion to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to reset such adverse 
party's testimony and/or briefing periods, as may be appropriate. If the 
deposing party fails to serve a copy of the transcript with exhibits on 
an adverse party after having been ordered to do so by the Board, the 
Board, in its discretion, may strike the deposition, or enter judgment 
as by default against the deposing party, or take any such other action 
as may be deemed appropriate.
    (b) The party who takes testimony is responsible for having all 
typographical errors in the transcript and all errors of arrangement, 
indexing and form of the transcript corrected, on notice to each adverse 
party, prior to the filing of one certified transcript with the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. The party who takes testimony is 
responsible for serving on each adverse party one copy of the corrected 
transcript or, if reasonably feasible, corrected pages to be inserted 
into the transcript previously served.
    (c) One certified transcript and exhibits shall be filed with the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Notice of such filing shall be served

arrangement, indexing and form.
    (e) Upon motion by any party, for good cause, the Trademark Trial

any exhibits that directly disclose any trade secret or other 
confidential research, development, or commercial information may be 
filed under seal and kept confidential under the provisions of 
Sec. 2.27(e). If any party or any attorney or agent of a party fails to 
comply with an order made under this paragraph, the Board may impose any 
of the sanctions authorized by Sec. 2.120(g).

Sec. 2.126  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 2.127  Motions.

    (a) Every motion shall be made in writing, shall contain a full 
statement of the grounds, and shall embody or be accompanied by a brief. 
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a brief in 
response to a motion shall be filed within fifteen days from the date of 
service of the motion unless another time is specified by the Trademark 
Trial and Appeal Board or the time is extended by stipulation of the 
parties approved by the Board, or upon motion granted by the Board, or 
upon order of the Board. If a motion for an extension is denied, the 
time for responding to the motion may remain as specified under this 
section. The Board may, in its discretion, consider a reply brief. 
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a reply brief, 
if filed, shall be filed within 15 days from the date of service of the 
brief in response to the motion. The time for filing a reply brief will 
not be extended. No further papers in support of or in opposition to a 
motion will be considered by the Board. Briefs shall be submitted in 
typewritten or printed form, double spaced, in at least pica or eleven-
point type, on letter-size paper. The brief in support of the motion and 
the brief in response to the motion shall not exceed 25 pages in length; 
and a reply brief shall not exceed 10 pages in length. Exhibits 
submitted in support of or in opposition to the motion shall not be 
deemed to be part of the brief for purposes of determining the length of 
the brief. When a party fails to file a brief in response to a motion, 
the Board may treat the motion as conceded. An oral hearing will not be 
held on a motion except on order by the Board.
    (b) Any request for reconsideration or modification of an order or 
decision issued on a motion must be filed within one month from the date 
thereof. A brief in response must be filed within 15 days from the date 
of service of the request.
    (c) Interlocutory motions, requests, and other matters not actually 
or potentially dispositive of a proceeding may be acted upon by a single 
Member of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board or by an Attorney-
Examiner of the Board to whom authority so to act has been delegated.
    (d) When any party files a motion to dismiss, or a motion for 
judgment on

[[Page 307]]

the pleadings, or a motion for summary judgment, or any other motion 
which is potentially dispositive of a proceeding, the case will be 
suspended by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board with respect to all 
matters not germane to the motion and no party should file any paper 
which is not germane to the motion except as otherwise specified in the 
Board's suspension order. If the case is not disposed of as a result of 
the motion, proceedings will be resumed pursuant to an order of the 
Board when the motion is decided.
    (e)(1) A motion for summary judgment may not be filed until 
notification of the proceeding has been sent to the parties by the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. A motion for summary judgment, if 
filed, should be filed prior to the commencement of the first testimony 
period, as originally set or as reset, and the Board, in its discretion, 
may deny as untimely any motion for summary judgment filed thereafter. A 
motion under Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, if 
filed in response to a motion for summary judgment, shall be filed 
within 30 days from the date of service of the summary judgment motion. 
The time for filing a motion under Rule 56(f) will not be extended. If 
no motion under Rule 56(f) is filed, a brief in response to the motion 
for summary judgment shall be filed within 30 days from the date of 
service of the motion unless the time is extended by stipulation of the 
parties approved by the Board, or upon motion granted by the Board, or 
upon order of the Board. If a motion for an extension is denied, the 
time for responding to the motion for summary judgment may remain as 
specified under this section. The Board may, in its discretion, consider 
a reply brief. A reply brief, if filed, shall be filed within 15 days 
from the date of service of the brief in response to the motion. The 
time for filing a reply brief will not be extended. No further papers in 
support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment will be 
considered by the Board.
    (2) For purposes of summary judgment only, a discovery deposition, 
or an answer to an interrogatory, or a document or thing produced in 
response to a request for production, or an admission to a request for 
admission, will be considered by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board if 
any party files, with the party's brief on the summary judgment motion, 
the deposition or any part thereof with any exhibit to the part that is 
filed, or a copy of the interrogatory and answer thereto with any 
exhibit made part of the answer, or a copy of the request for production 
and the documents or things produced in response thereto, or a copy of 
the request for admission and any exhibit thereto and the admission (or 
a statement that the party from which an admission was requested failed 
to respond thereto).
    (f) The Board will not hold any person in contempt, or award 
attorneys' fees or other expenses to any party.

Sec. 2.128  Briefs at final hearing.

    (a)(1) The brief of the party in the position of plaintiff shall be 
due not later than sixty days after the date set for the close of 
rebuttal testimony. The brief of the party in the position of defendant, 
if filed, shall be due not later than thirty days after the due date of 
the first brief. A reply brief by the party in the position of 
plaintiff, if filed, shall be due not later than fifteen days after the 
due date of the defendant's brief.
    (2) When there is a counterclaim, or when proceedings have been 
consolidated and one party is in the position of plaintiff in one of the 
involved proceedings and in the position of defendant in another of the 
involved proceedings, or when there is an interference or a concurrent 
use registration proceeding involving more than two parties, the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will set the due dates for the filing 
of the main brief, and the answering brief, and the rebuttal brief by 
the parties.
    (3) When a party in the position of plaintiff fails to file a main 
brief, an order may be issued allowing plaintiff until a set time, not 
less than fifteen days, in which to show cause why the Board should not 
treat such failure as a concession of the case. If plaintiff fails to 
file a response to the order, or

[[Page 308]]

files a response indicating that he has lost interest in the case, 
judgment may be entered against plaintiff.
    (b) Briefs shall be submitted in typewritten or printed form, double 
spaced, in at least pica or eleven-point type, on letter-size paper. 
Each brief shall contain an alphabetical index of cases cited therein. 
Without prior leave of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, a main 
brief on the case shall not exceed fifty-five pages in length in its 
entirety, including the table of contents, index of cases, description

    (a) If a party desires to have an oral argument at final hearing, 
the party shall request such argument by a separate notice filed not 
later than ten days after the due date for the filing of the last reply 
brief in the proceeding. Oral arguments will be heard by at least three 
Members of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board at the time specified in 
the notice of hearing. If any party appears at the specified time, that 
party will be heard. If the Board is prevented from hearing the case at 
the specified time, a new hearing date will be set. Unless otherwise 
permitted, oral arguments in an inter partes case will be limited to 
thirty minutes for each party. A party in the position of plaintiff may 
reserve part of the time allowed for oral argument to present a rebuttal 
argument.
    (b) The date or time of a hearing may be reset, so far as is 
convenient and proper, to meet the wishes of the parties and their 
attorneys or other authorized representatives.
    (c) Any request for rehearing or reconsideration or modification of 
a decision issued after final hearing must be filed within one month 
from the date of the decision. A brief in response must be filed within 
fifteen days from the date of service of the request. The times 
specified may be extended by order of the Trademark Trial and Appeal 
Board on motion for good cause.
    (d) When a party to an inter partes proceeding before the Trademark 
Trial and Appeal Board cannot prevail without establishing constructive 
use pursuant to section 7(c) of the Act in an application under section 
1(b) of the Act, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will enter a 
judgment in favor of that party, subject to the party's establishment of 
constructive use. The time for filing an appeal or for commencing a 
civil action under section 21 of the Act shall run from the date of the 
entry of the judgment.

Sec. 2.130  New matter suggested by Examiner of Trademarks.

    If, during the pendency of an inter partes case, facts appear which, 
in the opinion of the Examiner of Trademarks, render the mark of any 
applicant involved unregistrable, the attention of the Trademark Trial 
and Appeal Board shall be called thereto. The Board may suspend the 
proceeding and refer the application to the Examiner of Trademarks for 
his determination of the question of registrability, following the final 
determination of which the application shall be returned to the Board 
for such further inter partes action as may be appropriate. The 
consideration of such facts by the Examiner of Trademarks shall be ex 
parte, but a copy of the action of the examiner will be furnished to the 
parties to the inter partes proceeding.

has not been tried under the pleadings as filed by the parties or as 
they might be deemed to be amended under Rule 15(b) of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure to conform to the evidence, the Trademark Trial and 
Appeal Board, in lieu of determining the matter in the decision

[[Page 309]]

on the proceeding, may refer the application to the examiner for 
reexamination in the event the applicant ultimately prevails in the 
inter partes proceeding. Upon receiving the application, the examiner 
shall withhold registration pending reexamination of the application in 
the light of the reference by the Board. If, upon reexamination, the 
examiner finally refuses registration to the applicant, an appeal may be 
taken as provided by Secs. 2.141 and 2.142.

Sec. 2.132  Involuntary dismissal for failure to take testimony.

    (a) If the time for taking testimony by any party in the position of 
plaintiff has expired and that party has not taken testimony or offered 
any other evidence, any party in the position of defendant may, without 
waiving the right to offer evidence in the event the motion is denied, 
move for dismissal on the ground of the failure of the plaintiff to 
prosecute. The party in the position of plaintiff shall have fifteen 
days from the date of service of the motion to show cause why judgment 
should not be rendered against him. In the absence of a showing of good 
and sufficient cause, judgment may be rendered against the party in the 
position of plaintiff. If the motion is denied, testimony periods will 
be reset for the party in the position of defendant and for rebuttal.
    (b) If no evidence other than a copy or copies of Patent and 
Trademark Office records is offered by any party in the position of 
plaintiff, any party in the position of defendant may, without waiving 
the right to offer evidence in the event the motion is denied, move for 
dismissal on the ground that upon the law and the facts the party in the 
position of plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The party in the 
position of plaintiff shall have fifteen days from the date of service 
of the motion to file a brief in response to the motion. The Trademark 
Trial and Appeal Board may render judgment against the party in the 
position of plaintiff, or the Board may decline to render judgment until 
all of the evidence is in the record. If judgment is not rendered, 
testimony periods will be reset for the party in the position of 
defendant and for rebuttal.
    (c) A motion filed under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must 
be filed before the opening of the testimony period of the moving party, 
except that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board may in its discretion 
grant a motion under paragraph (a) even if the motion was filed after 
the opening of the testimony period of the moving party.

Sec. 2.133  Amendment of application or registration during proceedings.

    (a) An application involved in a proceeding may not be amended in 
substance nor may a registration be amended or disclaimed in part, 
except with the consent of the other party or parties and the approval 
of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, or except upon motion.
    (b) If, in an inter partes proceeding, the Trademark Trial and 
Appeal Board finds that a party whose application or registration is the 
subject of the proceeding is not entitled to registration in the absence 
of a specified restriction to the involved application or registration, 
the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will allow the party time in which 
to file a request that the application or registration be amended to 
conform to the findings of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, failing 
which judgment will be entered against the party.
    (c) Geographic limitations will be considered and determined by the 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board only in the context of a concurrent use 
registration proceeding.
    (d) A plaintiff's pleaded registration will not be restricted in the 
absence of a counterclaim to cancel the registration in whole or in 
part, except that a counterclaim need not be filed if the registration 
is the subject of another proceeding between the same parties or anyone 
in privity therewith.

    (a) After the commencement of a cancellation proceeding, if the 
respondent applies for cancellation of the involved registration under 
section 7(e) of the Act of 1946 without the written consent of every 
adverse party to the proceeding, judgment shall be entered against the 
respondent. The written consent of an adverse party may be signed by the 
adverse party or by the adverse party's attorney or other authorized 
representative.
    (b) After the commencement of a cancellation proceeding, if it comes 
to the attention of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that the 
respondent has permitted his involved registration to be cancelled under 
section 8 of the Act of 1946 or has failed to renew his involved 
registration under section 9 of the Act of 1946, an order may be issued 
allowing respondent until a set time, not less than fifteen days, in 
which to show cause why such cancellation or failure to renew should not 
be deemed to be the equivalent of a cancellation by request of 
respondent without the consent of the adverse party and should not 
result in entry of judgment against respondent as provided by paragraph 
(a) of this section. In the absence of a showing of good and sufficient 
cause, judgment may be entered against respondent as provided by 
paragraph (a) of this section.

                                 Appeals


<R05>
Sec. 2.141  Ex parte appeals from the Examiner of Trademarks.

    Every applicant for the registration of a mark may, upon final 
refusal by the Examiner of Trademarks, appeal to the Trademark Trial and 
Appeal Board upon payment of the prescribed fee for each class in the 
application for which an appeal is taken. An appeal which includes 
insufficient fees to cover all classes in the application should specify 
the particular class or classes in which an appeal is taken. A second 
refusal on the same grounds may be considered as final by the applicant 
for purpose of appeal.

[41 FR 760, Jan. 5, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 2.142  Time and manner of ex parte appeals.

    (a) Any appeal filed under the provisions of Sec. 2.141 must be 
filed within six months from the date of final refusal or the date of 
the action from which the appeal is taken. An appeal is taken by filing 
a notice of appeal and paying the appeal fee.
    (b)(1) The brief of appellant shall be filed within sixty days from 
the date of appeal. If the brief is not filed within the time allowed, 
the appeal may be dismissed. The examiner shall, within sixty days after 
the brief of appellant is sent to the examiner, file with the Trademark 
Trial and Appeal Board a written brief answering the brief of appellant 
and shall mail a copy of the brief to the appellant. The appellant may 
file a reply brief within twenty days from the date of mailing of the 
brief of the examiner.
    (2) Briefs shall be submitted in typewritten or printed form, double 
spaced, in at least pica or eleven-point type, on letter-size paper. 
Without prior leave

[[Page 311]]

of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, a brief shall not exceed 
twenty-five pages in length in its entirety.
    (c) All requirements made by the examiner and not the subject of 
appeal shall be complied with prior to the filing of an appeal.
    (d) The record in the application should be complete prior to the 
filing of an appeal. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board will 
ordinarily not consider additional evidence filed with the Board by the 
appellant or by the examiner after the appeal is filed. After an appeal 
is filed, if the appellant or the examiner desires to introduce 
additional evidence, the appellant or the examiner may request the Board 
to suspend the appeal and to remand the application for further 
examination.
    (e)(1) If the appellant desires an oral hearing, a request therefor 
should be made by a separate notice filed not later than ten days after 
the due date for a reply brief. Oral argument will be heard by at least 
three Members of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board at the time 
specified in the notice of hearing, which may be reset if the Board is 
prevented from hearing the argument at the specified time or, so far as 
is convenient and proper, to meet the wish of the appellant or his 
attorney or other authorized representative.
    (2) If the appellant requests an oral argument, the examiner who 
issued the refusal of registration or the requirement from which the 
appeal is taken, or in lieu thereof another examiner from the same 
examining division as designated by the supervisory attorney thereof, 
shall present an oral argument. If no request for an oral hearing is 
made by the appellant, the appeal will be decided on the record and 
briefs.
    (3) Oral argument will be limited to twenty minutes by the appellant 
and ten minutes by the examiner. The appellant may reserve part of the 
time allowed for oral argument to present a rebuttal argument.
    (f)(1) If, during an appeal from a refusal of registration, it 
appears to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that an issue not 
previously raised may render the mark of the appellant unregistrable, 
the Board may suspend the appeal and remand the application to the 
examiner for further examination to be completed within thirty days.
    (2) If the further examination does not result in an additional 
ground for refusal of registration, the examiner shall promptly return 
the application to the Board, for resumption of the appeal, with a 
written statement that further examination did not result in an 
additional ground for refusal of registration.
    (3) If the further examination does result in an additional ground 
for refusal of registration, the examiner and appellant shall proceed as 
provided by Secs. 2.61, 2.62, 2.63 and 2.64. If the ground for refusal 
is made final, the examiner shall return the application to the Board, 
which shall thereupon issue an order allowing the appellant sixty days 
from the date of the order to file a supplemental brief limited to the 
additional ground for the refusal of registration. If the supplemental 
brief is not filed by the appellant within the time allowed, the appeal 
may be dismissed.
    (4) If the supplemental brief of the appellant is filed, the 
examiner shall, within sixty days after the supplemental brief of the 
appellant is sent to the examiner, file with the Board a written brief 
answering the supplemental brief of appellant and shall mail a copy of 
the brief to the appellant. The appellant may file a reply brief within 
twenty days from the date of mailing of the brief of the examiner.
    (5) If an oral hearing on the appeal had been requested prior to the 
remand of the application but not yet held, an oral hearing will be set 
and heard as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. If an oral 
hearing had been held prior to the remand or had not been previously 
requested by the appellant, an oral hearing may be requested by the 
appellant by a separate notice filed not later than ten days after the 
due date for a reply brief on the additional ground for refusal of 
registration. If the appellant files a request for an oral hearing, one 
will be set and heard as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (6) If, during an appeal from a refusal of registration, it appears 
to the examiner that an issue not involved in the

[[Page 312]]

appeal may render the mark of the appellant unregistrable, the examiner 
may, by written request, ask the Board to suspend the appeal and to 
remand the application to the examiner for further examination. If the 
request is granted, the examiner and appellant shall proceed as provided 
by Secs. 2.61, 2.62, 2.63 and 2.64. After the additional ground for 
refusal of registration has been withdrawn or made final, the examiner 
shall return the application to the Board, which shall resume 
proceedings in the appeal and take further appropriate action with 
respect thereto.
    (g) An application which has been considered and decided on appeal 
will not be reopened except for the entry of a disclaimer under section 
6 of the Act of 1946 or upon order of the Commissioner, but a petition 
to the Commissioner to reopen an application will be considered only 
upon a showing of sufficient cause for consideration of any matter not 
already adjudicated.

appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit waives any 
right to proceed under section 21(b) of the Act.
    (3) Any adverse party to an appeal taken to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit by a defeated party in an inter partes 
proceeding may file a notice with the Commissioner within twenty days

[[Page 313]]

review of a decision of the Board should file written notice thereof in 
the Patent and Trademark Office, addressed to the Board, within one 
month after the expiration of the time for appeal or civil action, in 
order to avoid premature termination of the Board proceeding.
    (d) Time for appeal or civil action. (1) The time for filing the

granted thereunder, the time for filing an appeal or commencing a civil 
action shall expire two months after action on the request. In inter 
partes cases, the time for filing a cross-action or a notice of a cross-
appeal expires

further proceedings conducted under section 21(b) of the Act, the time 
for filing a civil action thereafter is specified in section 21(a)(1) of

of the period for filing an appeal or commencing a civil action, or (2) 
upon written request after the expiration of the period for filing an 
appeal or commencing a civil action upon a showing that the failure to

    (a) Be filed by the owner within the period set forth in 
Sec. 2.160(a);
    (b) Include a statement that is signed and verified (sworn to) or 
supported by a declaration under Sec. 2.20 by a person properly

use or excusable nonuse of the mark within the period set forth in 
section 8 of the Act. The verified statement must be executed on or 
after the beginning of the filing period specified in Sec. 2.160(a). A 
person who is properly authorized to sign on behalf of the owner is:
    (1) A person with legal authority to bind the owner; or
    (2) A person with firsthand knowledge of the facts and actual or 
implied authority to act on behalf of the owner; or
    (3) An attorney as defined in Sec. 10.1(c) of this chapter who has 
an actual or implied written or verbal power of attorney from the owner.
    (c) Include the registration number;
    (d)(1) Include the fee required by Sec. 2.6 for each class of goods 
or services that the affidavit or declaration covers;
    (2) If the affidavit or declaration is filed during the grace period 
under section 8(c)(1) of the Act, include the late fee per class 
required by Sec. 2.6;
    (3) If at least one fee is submitted for a multi-class registration, 
but the class(es) to which the fee(s) should be applied are not 
specified, the Office will issue a notice requiring either the 
submission of additional fee(s) or an indication of the class(es) to 
which the original fee(s) should be applied. Additional fee(s) may be 
submitted if the requirements of Sec. 2.164 are met. If the required 
fee(s) are not submitted and the class(es) to which the original fee(s) 
should be applied are not specified, the Office will presume that the 
fee(s) cover the classes in ascending order, beginning with the lowest 
numbered class;
    (e)(1) Specify the goods or services for which the mark is in use in 
commerce, and/or the goods or services for which excusable nonuse is 
claimed under Sec. 2.161(f)(2);
    (2) If the affidavit or declaration covers less than all the goods 
or services, or less than all the classes in the registration, specify 
the goods or services being deleted from the registration;
    (f)(1) State that the registered mark is in use in commerce on or in 
connection with the goods or services in the registration; or
    (2) If the registered mark is not in use in commerce on or in 
connection with all the goods or services in the registration, set forth 
the date when use of the mark in commerce stopped and the approximate 
date when use is expected to resume; and recite facts to show that 
nonuse as to those goods or services is due to special circumstances 
that excuse the nonuse and is not due to an intention to abandon the 
mark;
    (g) Include a specimen showing current use of the mark for each 
class of goods or services, unless excusable nonuse is claimed under 
Sec. 2.161(f)(2). The specimen must:
    (1) Show the mark as actually used on or in connection with the 
goods or in the sale or advertising of the services. A photocopy or 
other reproduction of the specimen showing the mark as actually used is 
acceptable. However, a photocopy that merely reproduces the registration 
certificate is not a proper specimen;
    (2) Be flat and no larger than 8\1/2\ inches (21.6 cm.) wide by 
11.69 inches (29.7 cm.) long. If a specimen exceeds these size

materially alter the character of the mark.
    (b) No amendment in the identification of goods or services in a

has been made that such mistake occurred in good faith through the fault 
of the applicant, the Commissioner may issue a certificate of 
correction, or in his discretion, a new certificate upon the payment of 
the required fee, provided that the correction does not involve such 
changes in the registration as to require republication of the mark.

correction is sought and the manner in which it arose, show that it 
occurred in good faith, be signed by the applicant and verified or

existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, 
modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new

support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have 
evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further

evidence, or if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a 
lack of information or belief.
    (c) Violations of paragraph (b)(1) of this section by a practitioner

document, or the validity or enforceability of any patent, trademark

    A practitioner may not solicit professional employment from a 
prospective client with whom the practitioner has no family or prior 
professional relationship, by mail, in-person or otherwise, when a 
significant motive for the practitioner's doing so is the practitioner's

current connection with a government agency or with a public or 
charitable legal services organization and is not otherwise in violation 
of Sec. 10.31.

partnership or other organization only when that is the fact.


<R05>
Sec. 10.36  Fees for legal services.

    (a) A practitioner shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or 
collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.
    (b) A fee is clearly excessive when, after a review of the facts, a 
practitioner of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm 
conviction that the fee is in excess of a reasonable fee. Factors to be 
considered as guides in determining the reasonableness of a fee include 
the following:
    (1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the

properly.

of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the 
practitioner.

Sec. 10.37  Division of fees among practitioners.

practitioner's law firm or law office, unless:
    (1) The client consents to employment of the other practitioner 
after a full disclosure that a division of fees will be made.
    (2) The division is made in proportion to the services performed and 
responsibility assumed by each.
    (3) The total fee of the practitioners does not clearly exceed 
reasonable compensation for all legal services rendered to the client.
    (b) This section does not prohibit payment to a former partner or

    (b) In connection with the settlement of a controversy or suit, a 
practitioner shall not enter into an agreement that restricts the 
practitioner's right to practice before the Office.


<R05>

    A practitioner shall not accept employment on behalf of a person if 
the practitioner knows or it is obvious that such person wishes to:
    (a) Bring a legal action, commence a proceeding before the Office, 
conduct a defense, assert a position in any proceeding pending before 
the Office, or otherwise have steps taken for the person, merely for the 
purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring any other person.
    (b) Present a claim or defense in litigation or any proceeding 
before the Office that is not warranted under existing law, unless it 
can be supported by good faith argument for an extension, modification,

    (a) A practitioner shall not withdraw from employment in a 
proceeding before the Office without permission from the Office (see 
Secs. 1.36 and 2.19 of this subchapter). In any event, a practitioner 
shall not withdraw from employment until the practitioner has taken 
reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the 
client, including giving due notice to his or her client, allowing time 
for employment of another practitioner, delivering to the client all 
papers and property to which the client is entitled, and complying with 
applicable laws and rules. A practitioner who withdraws from employment 
shall refund promptly any part of a fee paid in advance that has not 
been earned.
    (b) Mandatory withdrawal. A practitioner representing a client 
before the Office shall withdraw from employment if:

bringing a legal action, commencing a proceeding before the Office,

proceeding pending before the Office, or is otherwise having steps taken 
for the client, merely for the purpose of harassing or maliciously 
injuring any person;
    (2) The practitoner knows or it is obvious that the practitoner's 
continued employment will result in violation of a Disciplinary Rule;
    (3) The practitioner's mental or physical condition renders it

    (4) The practitioner is discharged by the client.

[[Page 357]]

    (c) Permissive withdrawal. If paragraph (b) of this section is not 
applicable, a practitioner may not request permission to withdraw in 
matters pending before the Office unless such request or such withdrawal 
is because:
    (1) The petitioner's client:
    (i) Insists upon presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted 
under existing law and cannot be supported by good faith argument for an 
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;
    (ii) Personally seeks to pursue an illegal course of conduct;
    (iii) Insists that the practitioner pursue a course of conduct that 
is illegal or that is prohibited under a Disciplinary Rule;
    (iv) By other conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the 
practitioner to carry out the employment effectively;
    (v) Insists, in a matter not pending before a tribunal, that the 
practitioner engage in conduct that is contrary to the judgment and 
advice of the practitioner but not prohibited under the Disciplinary 
Rule; or
    (vi) Has failed to pay one or more bills rendered by the 
practitioner for an unreasonable period of time or has failed to honor 
an agreement to pay a retainer in advance of the performance of legal 
services.
    (2) The practitioner's continued employment is likely to result in a 
violation of a Disciplinary Rule;
    (3) The practitioner's inability to work with co-counsel indicates 
that the best interests of the client likely will be served by 
withdrawal;
    (4) The practitioner's mental or physical condition renders it 
difficult for the practitioner to carry out the employment effectively;
    (5) The practitioner's client knowingly and freely assents to 
termination of the employment; or
    (6) The practitioner believes in good faith, in a proceeding pending 
before the Office, that the Office will find the existence of other good 
cause for withdrawal.

    (a) Except with the consent of a client after full disclosure, a

reasonably may be affected by the practitioner's own financial, 
business, property, or personal interests.

before the Office if the practitioner knows or it is obvious that the 
practitioner or another practitioner in the practitioner's firm ought to

practitioner or another practitioner in the practitioner's firm may 
testify:

the extent permitted under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) A practitioner shall not continue multiple employment if the 
exercise of the practitioner's independent professional judgment in 
behalf of a client will be or is likely to be adversely affected by the 
practitoner's representation of another client, or if it would be likely 
to involve the practitioner in representing differing interests, except 
to the extent permitted under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) In the situations covered by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section a practitioner may represent multiple clients if it is obvious

    (1) Fail to seek the lawful objectives of a client through 
reasonably available means permitted by law and the Disciplinary Rules, 
except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section. A practitioner does 
not violate the provisions of this section, however, by acceding to 
reasonable requests of opposing counsel which do not prejudice the 
rights of the client, by being punctual in fulfilling all professional 
commitments, by avoiding offensive tactics, or by treating with courtesy 
and consideration all persons involved in the legal process.
    (2) Fail to carry out a contract of employment entered into with a 
client for professional services, but a practitioner may withdraw as

the practitioner knows or when it is obvious that such action would 
serve merely to harass or maliciously injure another.
    (2) Knowingly advance a claim or defense that is unwarranted under 
existing law, except that a practitioner may advance such claim or 
defense if it can be supported by good faith argument for an extension, 
modification, or reversal of existing law.

practitioner is required by law to reveal.
    (4) Knowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence.

practitioner shall reveal the fraud to the affected person or tribunal.

tribunal shall promptly reveal the fraud to the tribunal.

by another practitioner in that matter unless the practitioner has the 
prior consent of the other practitioner representing such other party or 
is authorized by law to do so. It is not improper, however, for a 
practitioner to encourage a client to meet with an opposing party for 
settlement discussions.
    (b) Give advice to a person who is not represented by a practitioner 
other than the advice to secure counsel, if the interests of such person 
are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the

issue, except when testifying as a witness.
    (4) Assert the practitioner's personal opinion as to the justness of 
a cause, as to the credibility of a witness, as to the culpability of a 
civil litigant, or as to the guilt or innocence of an accused; but the 
practitioner may argue, on the practitioner's analysis of the evidence, 
for any position or conclusion with respect to the matters stated 
herein.
    (5) Engage in undignified or discourteous conduct before the Office 
(see Sec. 1.3 of the subchapter).

judge, official, or Office employee before whom the proceeding is 
pending, except:

practitioner to the satisfaction of the Director;
    (5) The practitioner acknowledges that, if and when he or she 
applies for reinstatement under Sec. 10.160, the Director will 
conclusively presume, for the limited purpose of determining the 
application for reinstatement, that:

or herself against (A) charges predicated on the violation under 
investigation or (B) charges set out in the complaint filed against the 
practitioner.
    (d) If filed on or after the date set by the administrative law 
judge for a hearing, the affidavit shall make the statements required by

[[Page 365]]

(1) through (4) of this section and shall state that:

could not successfully defend himself or herself against (i) charges 
predicated on the violation under investigation or (ii) charges set out 
in the complaint.
    (e) When an affidavit under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is 
received while an investigation is pending, the Commissioner shall enter 
an order excluding the practitioner ``on consent.'' When an affidavit 
under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is received after a complaint 
under Sec. 10.134 has been filed, the Director shall notify the 
administrative law judge. The administrative law judge shall enter an 
order transferring the disciplinary proceeding to the Commissioner and

under this section and who intends to reapply for admission to practice 
before the Office must comply with the provisions of Sec. 10.158.
    (g) Settlement. Before or after a complaint is filed under 
Sec. 10.134, a settlement conference may occur between the Director and 
a practitioner for the purpose of settling any disciplinary matter. If 
an offer of settlement is made by the Director or the practitioner and

writing.

respondent if an answer is not timely filed.
    (5) Be signed by the Director.

respondent of any violation of the Disciplinary Rules which form the 
basis for the disciplinary proceeding so that the respondent is able to 
adequately prepare a defense.


<R05>
Sec. 10.135  Service of complaint.

    (a) A complaint may be served on a respondent in any of the 
following methods:
    (1) By handing a copy of the complaint personally to the respondent, 
in which case the individual handing the complaint to the respondent 
shall file an affidavit with the Director indicating the time and place 
the complaint was handed to the respondent.
    (2) By mailing a copy of the complaint by ``Express Mail'' or first-
class mail to:
    (i) A registered practitioner at the address for which separate 
notice was last received by the Director or
    (ii) A non-registered practitioner at the last address for the 
respondent known to the Director.
    (3) By any method mutually agreeable to the Director and the 
respondent.
    (b) If a complaint served by mail under paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section is returned by the U.S. Postal Service, the Director shall mail 
a second copy of the complaint to the respondent. If the second copy of 
the complaint is also returned by the U.S. Postal Service, the Director 
shall serve the respondent by publishing an appropriate notice in the 
Official Gazette for four consecutive weeks, in which case the time for 
answer shall be at least thirty days from the fourth publication of the 
notice.
    (c) If a respondent is a registered practitioner, the Director may 
serve simultaneously with the complaint a letter under Sec. 10.11(b). 
The Director may require the respondent to answer the Sec. 10.11(b) 
letter within a period of not less than 15 days. An answer to the 
Sec. 10.11(b) letter shall constitute proof of service. If the 
respondent fails to answer the Sec. 10.11(b) letter, his or her

[[Page 366]]

name will be removed from the register as provided by Sec. 10.11(b).
    (d) If the respondent is represented by an attorney under 
Sec. 10.140(a), a copy of the complaint shall also be served on the 
attorney.


<R05>
Sec. 10.136  Answer to complaint.

    (a) Time for answer. An answer to a complaint shall be filed within 
a time set in the complaint which shall be not less than thirty days.
    (b) With whom filed. The answer shall be filed in writing with the 
administrative law judge. The time for filing an answer may be extended 
once for a period of no more than thirty days by the administrative law 
judge upon a showing of good cause provided a motion requesting an 
extension of time is filed within thirty days after the date the 
complaint is filed by the Director. A copy of the answer shall be served 
on the Director.
    (c) Content. The respondent shall include in the answer a statement 
of the facts which constitute the grounds of defense and shall 
specifically admit or deny each allegation set forth in the complaint. 
The respondent shall not deny a material allegation in the complaint 
which the respondent knows to be true or state that respondent is 
without sufficient information to form a belief as to the truth of an 
allegation when in fact the respondent possesses that information. The 
respondent shall also state affirmatively special matters of defense.
    (d) Failure to deny allegations in complaint. Every allegation in 
the complaint which is not denied by a respondent in the answer is 
deemed to be admitted and may be considered proven. No further evidence 
in respect of that allegation need be received by the administrative law 
judge at any hearing. Failure to timely file an answer will constitute 
an admission of the allegations in the complaint.
    (e) Reply by Director. No reply to an answer is required by the 
Director and any affirmative defense in the answer shall be deemed to be 
denied. The Director may, however, file a reply if he or she chooses or 
if ordered by the administrative law judge.

administrative law judge will not be reviewed by the Commissioner

that the interlocutory order involves a controlling question of 
procedure or law as to which there is a substantial ground for a 
difference of opinion and (ii) that an immediate decision by the

disciplinary proceeding or
    (2) In an extraordinary situation where justice requires review

    (a) Within thirty (30) days from the date of the initial decision of 
the administrative law judge under Sec. 10.154, either party may appeal 
to the Commissioner. If an appeal is taken, the time for filing a cross-

administrative law judge, whichever is later. An appeal or cross-appeal 
by the respondent will be filed and served with the Director in 
duplicate and will include exceptions to the decisions of the 
administrative law judge and supporting reasons for those exceptions. If 
the Director files the appeal or cross-appeal, the Director shall serve

discovered evidence could not have been discovered by due diligence.
    (d) In the absence of an appeal by the Director, failure by the 
respondent to appeal under the provisions of this section shall be 
deemed to be both acceptance by the respondent of the initial decision 
and waiver by the respondent of the right to further administrative or 
judicial review.

those portions of the record as may be cited by the parties in order to 
limit the issues. The Commissioner shall transmit a copy of the final

<R04>
                  Subpart A--Freedom of Information Act


<R05>
Sec. 102.1  General.

    (a) The information in this part is furnished for the guidance of 
the public and in compliance with the requirements of the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), as amended (5 U.S.C. 552). This part sets forth 
the procedures the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) 
follows to make publicly available the materials and indices specified 
in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and records requested under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3). 
Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular USPTO 
activity (for example, press releases issued by the Office of Public 
Affairs) may be provided to the public without following this part. 
USPTO's policy is to make discretionary disclosures of records or 
information exempt from disclosure under FOIA whenever disclosure would 
not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this 
policy does not create any right enforceable in court.
    (b) As used in this subpart, FOIA Officer means the USPTO employee 
designated to administer FOIA for USPTO. To ensure prompt processing of 
a request, correspondence should be addressed to the FOIA Officer, 
United States Patent and Trademark Office, WASHINGTON DC 20231 or 
delivered by hand to Crystal Park Two, 2121 Crystal Drive, Suite 714, 
Arlington, Virginia.


<R05>
Sec. 102.2  Public reference facilities.

    (a) USPTO maintains a public reference facility that contains the 
records FOIA requires to be made regularly available for public 
inspection and copying; furnishes information and otherwise assists the 
public concerning USPTO operations under FOIA; and receives and 
processes requests for records under FOIA. The FOIA Officer is 
responsible for determining which of USPTO's records are required to be 
made available for public inspection and copying, and for making those 
records available in USPTO's reference and records inspection facility. 
The FOIA Officer shall maintain and make available for public inspection 
and copying a current subject-matter index of USPTO's public inspection 
facility records. Each index shall be updated regularly, at least 
quarterly, with respect to newly included records. In accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a)(2), USPTO

[[Page 382]]

has determined that it is unnecessary and impracticable to publish 
quarterly, or more frequently, and distribute copies of the index and 
supplements thereto. The public reference facility is located in the 
Public Search Room, Crystal Plaza Three, 2021 South Clark Place, Room 
1A01, Arlington, Virginia.
    (b) The FOIA Officer shall also make public inspection facility 
records created by USPTO on or after November 1, 1996, available 
electronically through USPTO's World Wide Web site (http://
www.uspto.gov). Information available at the site shall include:
    (1) The FOIA Officer's index of the public inspection facility 
records, which indicates which records are available electronically; and
    (2) The general index referred to in paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section.
    (c) USPTO maintains and makes available for public inspection and 
copying:
    (1) A current index providing identifying information for the public 
as to any matter that is issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 
1967, and that is retained as a record and is required to be made 
available or published. Copies of the index are available upon request 
after payment of the direct cost of duplication;
    (2) Copies of records that have been released and that the FOIA 
Officer determines, because of their subject matter, have become or are 
likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially 
the same records;
    (3) A general index of the records described in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section;
    (4) Final opinions and orders, including concurring and dissenting 
opinions made in the adjudication of cases;
    (5) Those statements of policy and interpretations that have been 
adopted by USPTO and are not published in the Federal Register; and
    (6) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that 
affect a member of the public.


<R05>
Sec. 102.3  Records under FOIA.

    (a) Records under FOIA include all Government records, regardless of 
format, medium or physical characteristics, and include electronic 
records and information, audiotapes, videotapes, and photographs.
    (b) There is no obligation to create, compile, or obtain from 
outside USPTO a record to satisfy a FOIA request. With regard to 
electronic data, the issue of whether records are created or merely 
extracted from an existing database is not always apparent. When 
responding to FOIA requests for electronic data where creation of a 
record or programming becomes an issue, USPTO shall undertake reasonable 
efforts to search for the information in electronic format.
    (c) USPTO officials may, upon request, create and provide new 
information pursuant to user fee statutes, such as the first paragraph 
of 15 U.S.C. 1525, or in accordance with authority otherwise provided by 
law. This is outside the scope of FOIA.
    (d) The FOIA Officer shall preserve all correspondence pertaining to 
the requests received under this subpart, as well as copies of all 
requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by 
Title 44 of the United States Code or a National Archives and Records 
Administration's General Records Schedule. The FOIA Officer shall not 
dispose of records while they are the subject of a pending request, 
appeal, or lawsuit under FOIA.


<R05>
Sec. 102.4  Requirements for making requests.

    (a) A request for USPTO records that are not customarily made 
available to the public as part of USPTO's regular informational 
services must be in writing, and shall be processed under FOIA, 
regardless of whether FOIA is mentioned in the request. Requests should 
be sent to the USPTO FOIA Officer, United States Patent and Trademark 
Office, Washington DC 20231 (records FOIA requires to be made regularly 
available for public inspection and copying are addressed in 
Sec. 102.2(c)). For the quickest handling, the request letter and 
envelope should be marked ``Freedom of Information Act Request.'' For 
requests for records about oneself, Sec. 102.24 contains additional 
requirements. For requests for records about another individual, either 
a written authorization signed by that individual permitting disclosure 
of those

[[Page 383]]

records to the requester or proof that that individual is deceased (for 
example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary) facilitates 
processing the request.
    (b) The records requested must be described in enough detail to 
enable USPTO personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of 
effort. Whenever possible, a request should include specific information 
about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, 
recipient, and subject matter of the record, and the name and location 
of the office where the record is located. Also, if records about a 
court case are sought, the title of the case, the court in which the 
case was filed, and the nature of the case should be included. If known, 
any file designations or descriptions for the requested records should 
be included. In general, the more specifically the request describes the 
records sought, the greater the likelihood that USPTO will locate those 
records. If the FOIA Officer determines that a request does not 
reasonably describe records, the FOIA Officer will inform the requester 
what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise 
insufficient. The FOIA Officer also may give the requester an 
opportunity to discuss the request so that it may be modified to meet 
the requirements of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 102.5  Responsibility for responding to requests.

    (a) In general. Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the USPTO will process FOIA requests directed to USPTO. In determining 
records responsive to a request, the FOIA Officer shall include only 
those records within USPTO's possession and control as of the date the 
FOIA Officer receives the request.
    (b) Consultations and referrals. If the FOIA Officer receives a 
request for a record in USPTO's possession in which another Federal 
agency subject to FOIA has the primary interest, the FOIA Officer shall 
refer the record to that agency for direct response to the requester. 
The FOIA Officer shall consult with another Federal agency before 
responding to a requester if the FOIA Officer receives a request for a 
record in which another Federal agency subject to FOIA has a significant 
interest, but not the primary interest; or another Federal agency not 
subject to FOIA has the primary interest or a significant interest. 
Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to have 
the primary interest in it.
    (c) Notice of referral. Whenever a FOIA Officer refers a document to 
another Federal agency for direct response to the requester, the FOIA 
Officer will ordinarily notify the requester in writing of the referral 
and inform the requester of the name of the agency to which the document 
was referred.
    (d) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All 
consultations and referrals shall be handled according to the date the 
FOIA request was received by the first Federal agency.
    (e) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. The FOIA 
Officer may make agreements with other Federal agencies to eliminate the 
need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.


<R05>
Sec. 102.6  Time limits and expedited processing.

    (a) In general. The FOIA Officer ordinarily shall respond to 
requests according to their order of receipt.
    (b) Initial response and appeal. Subject to paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, an initial response shall be made within 20 working days (i.e., 
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the receipt 
of a request for a record under this part by the proper FOIA Officer 
identified in accordance with Sec. 102.5(a), and an appeal shall be 
decided within 20 working days of its receipt by the Office of the 
General Counsel.
    (c) Unusual circumstances. (1) In unusual circumstances as specified 
in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the FOIA Officer may extend the 
time limits in paragraph (b) of this section by notifying the requester 
in writing as soon as practicable of the unusual circumstances and of 
the date by which processing of the request is expected to be completed. 
Extensions of time for the initial determination and extensions on 
appeal may not exceed a total of ten working days, unless the requester 
agrees to a longer extension, or

[[Page 384]]

the FOIA Officer provides the requester with an opportunity either to 
limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within the 
applicable time limit, or to arrange an alternative time frame for 
processing the request or a modified request.
    (2) As used in this section, unusual circumstances means, but only 
to the extent reasonably necessary to properly process the particular 
request:
    (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
field facilities or other establishments separate from the office 
processing the request;
    (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a 
voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are the subject 
of a single request; or
    (iii) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practicable speed, with another Federal agency having a substantial 
interest in the determination of the request.
    (3) Unusual circumstances do not include a delay that results from a 
predictable workload of requests, unless USPTO demonstrates reasonable 
progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests. Refusal to 
reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternate time 
frame may affect a requester's ability to obtain judicial review.
    (4) If the FOIA Officer reasonably believes that multiple requests 
submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, 
constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual 
circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, the 
FOIA Officer may aggregate them. Multiple requests involving unrelated 
matters will not be aggregated.
    (d) Multitrack processing. (1) The FOIA Officer may use two or more 
processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex 
requests based on the number of pages involved, or some other measure of 
the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, and 
whether the request qualifies for expedited processing as described in 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) The FOIA Officer may provide requesters in a slower track with 
an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify 
for faster processing. The FOIA Officer may contact the requester by 
telephone or by letter, whichever is most efficient in each case.
    (e) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals shall be taken 
out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined 
they involve:
    (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could 
reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual;
    (ii) The loss of substantial due process rights;
    (iii) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which 
there exist questions about the Government's integrity that affect 
public confidence; or
    (iv) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged 
Federal Government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information.
    (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of 
the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt 
determination, a request for expedited processing should be sent to the 
FOIA Officer.
    (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a 
statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's 
knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting 
expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category 
described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, if not a full-time 
member of the news media, must establish that he or she is a person 
whose main professional activity or occupation is information 
dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. A 
requester within the category described in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this 
section must also establish a particular urgency to inform the public 
about the Government activity involved in the request, beyond the 
public's right to know about Government activity generally. The 
formality of certification may be waived as a matter of administrative 
discretion.
    (4) Within ten calendar days of receipt of a request for expedited 
processing, the FOIA Officer will decide whether to grant it and shall 
notify the

[[Page 385]]

requester of the decision. If a request for expedited treatment is 
granted, the request shall be given priority and processed as soon as 
practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal 
of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.


<R05>
Sec. 102.7  Responses to requests.

    (a) Grants of requests. If the FOIA Officer makes a determination to 
grant a request in whole or in part, the FOIA Officer will notify the 
requester in writing. The FOIA Officer will inform the requester in the 
notice of any fee charged under Sec. 102.11 and disclose records to the 
requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fee. Records disclosed 
in part shall be marked or annotated to show each applicable FOIA 
exemption and the amount of information deleted, unless doing so would 
harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of 
the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if 
feasible.
    (b) Adverse determinations of requests. If the FOIA Officer makes an 
adverse determination regarding a request, the FOIA Officer will notify 
the requester of that determination in writing. An adverse determination 
is a denial of a request in any respect, namely: A determination to 
withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that 
a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination 
that a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought 
by the requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a 
record subject to FOIA (except that a determination under Sec. 102.11(j) 
that records are to be made available under a fee statute other than 
FOIA is not an adverse determination); a determination against the 
requester on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request 
for a fee waiver; or a denial of a request for expedited treatment. Each 
denial letter shall be signed by the FOIA Officer and shall include:
    (1) The name and title or position of the denying official;
    (2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including 
applicable FOIA exemption(s);
    (3) An estimate of the volume of records or information withheld, in 
number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation. This 
estimate need not be provided if the volume is otherwise indicated 
through deletions on records disclosed in part, or if providing an 
estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA 
exemption; and
    (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed, and a list of the 
requirements for filing an appeal under Sec. 102.10(b).


<R05>
Sec. 102.9  Business Information.

    (a) In general. Business information obtained by USPTO from a 
submitter will be disclosed under FOIA only under this section.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) Business information means commercial or financial information, 
obtained by USPTO from a submitter, which may be protected from 
disclosure under FOIA exemption 4 (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)).
    (2) Submitter means any person or entity outside the Federal 
Government from whom USPTO obtains business information, directly or 
indirectly. The term includes corporations; state, local and tribal 
governments; and foreign governments.
    (c) Designation of business information. A submitter of business 
information should designate by appropriate markings, either at the time 
of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its 
submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under FOIA 
exemption 4. These designations will expire ten years after the date of 
the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification 
for, a longer designation period.
    (d) Notice to submitters. The FOIA Officer shall provide a submitter 
with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal 
that seeks its business information whenever required under paragraph 
(e) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this 
section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity under paragraph 
(f) of this section to object to disclosure of any specified portion of 
that information. Such written notice shall be sent via certified

[[Page 386]]

mail, return receipt requested, or similar means. The notice shall 
either describe the business information requested or include copies of 
the requested records containing the information. When notification of a 
large number of submitters is required, notification may be made by 
posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to 
accomplish notification.
    (e) When notice is required. Notice shall be given to the submitter 
whenever:
    (1) The information has been designated in good faith by the 
submitter as protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption 4; or
    (2) The FOIA Officer has reason to believe that the information may 
be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption 4.
    (f) Opportunity to object to disclosure. The FOIA Officer shall 
allow a submitter seven working days (i.e., excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the 
written notice described in paragraph (d) of this section to provide the 
FOIA Officer with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. 
The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of 
the information under any exemption of FOIA and, in the case of 
exemption 4, it must show why the information is a trade secret or 
commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. 
If a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, 
the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of 
the information. Information a submitter provides under this paragraph 
may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.
    (g) Notice of intent to disclose. The FOIA Officer shall consider a 
submitter's objections and specific grounds under FOIA for nondisclosure 
in deciding whether to disclose business information. If the FOIA 
Officer decides to disclose business information over the objection of a 
submitter, the FOIA Officer shall give the submitter written notice via 
certified mail, return receipt requested, or similar means, which shall 
include:
    (1) A statement of reason(s) why the submitter's objections to 
disclosure were not sustained;
    (2) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and
    (3) A statement that the FOIA Officer intends to disclose the 
information seven working days from the date the submitter receives the 
notice.
    (h) Exceptions to notice requirements. The notice requirements of 
paragraphs (d) and (g) of this section shall not apply if:
    (1) The FOIA Officer determines that the information should not be 
disclosed;
    (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been 
officially made available to the public;
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than 
FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with Executive Order 
12600; or
    (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of 
this section appears obviously frivolous, in which case the FOIA Officer 
shall provide the submitter written notice of any final decision to 
disclose the information seven working days from the date the submitter 
receives the notice.
    (i) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester files a lawsuit 
seeking to compel the disclosure of business information, the FOIA 
Officer shall promptly notify the submitter.
    (j) Corresponding notice to requesters. Whenever a FOIA Officer 
provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to 
disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section, the FOIA Officer shall 
also notify the requester(s). Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit 
seeking to prevent the disclosure of business information, the FOIA 
Officer shall notify the requester(s).


<R05>
Sec. 102.10  Appeals from initial determinations or untimely delays.

    (a) If a request for records is initially denied in whole or in 
part, or has not been timely determined, or if a requester receives an 
adverse initial determination regarding any other matter under this 
subpart (as described in Sec. 102.7(b)), the requester may file a 
written appeal, which must be received by the Office of General Counsel 
within thirty calendar days of the date of the

[[Page 387]]

written denial or, if there has been no determination, may be submitted 
anytime after the due date, including the last extension under 
Sec. 102.6(c), of the determination.
    (b) Appeals shall be decided by a Deputy General Counsel. Appeals 
should be addressed to the General Counsel, United States Patent and 
Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231. Both the letter and the appeal 
envelope should be clearly marked ``Freedom of Information Appeal''. The 
appeal must include a copy of the original request and the initial 
denial, if any, and may include a statement of the reasons why the 
records requested should be made available and why the initial denial, 
if any, was in error. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral 
argument or hearing on appeal is provided.
    (c) If an appeal is granted, the person making the appeal shall be 
immediately notified and copies of the releasable documents shall be 
made available promptly thereafter upon receipt of appropriate fees 
determined in accordance with Sec. 102.11.
    (d) If no determination of an appeal has been sent to the requester 
within the twenty-working-day period specified in Sec. 102.6(b) or the 
last extension thereof, the requester is deemed to have exhausted his 
administrative remedies with respect to the request, giving rise to a 
right of judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C). If the person 
making a request initiates a civil action against USPTO based on the 
provision in this paragraph, the administrative appeal process may 
continue.
    (e) A determination on appeal shall be in writing and, when it 
denies records in whole or in part, the letter to the requester shall 
include:
    (1) A brief explanation of the basis for the denial, including a 
list of applicable FOIA exemptions and a description of how the 
exemptions apply;
    (2) A statement that the decision is final;
    (3) Notification that judicial review of the denial is available in 
the United States district court for the district in which the requester 
resides or has its principal place of business, the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, or the District of 
Columbia; and
    (4) The name and title or position of the official responsible for 
denying the appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 102.11  Fees.

    (a) In general. USPTO shall charge for processing requests under 
FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except when fees 
are limited under paragraph (d) of this section or when a waiver or 
reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (k) of this section. USPTO 
shall collect all applicable fees before sending copies of requested 
records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order 
made payable to the Treasury of the United States.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of a 
person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or 
her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering 
those interests through litigation. The FOIA Officer shall determine, 
whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the 
requested records. When it appears that the requester will put the 
records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request 
itself or because the FOIA Officer has reasonable cause to doubt a 
requester's stated use, the FOIA Officer shall provide the requester a 
reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.
    (2) Direct costs means those expenses USPTO incurs in searching for 
and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) 
records to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, 
the labor costs of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of 
pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits). 
Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of 
space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are 
kept.
    (3) Duplication means the making of a copy of a record, or of the 
information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. 
Copies may take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or 
electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others. 
The FOIA Officer shall honor a

[[Page 388]]

requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the 
record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested 
form or format.
    (4) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private 
elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher 
education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution 
of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, 
that operates a program of scholarly research. To be in this category, a 
requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under 
the auspices of a qualifying institution, and that the records are 
sought to further scholarly research rather than for a commercial use.
    (5) Noncommercial scientific institution means an institution that 
is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as that term is defined in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the 
purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not 
intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this 
category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is 
made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records 
are sought to further scientific research rather than for a commercial 
use.
    (6) Representative of the news media, or news media requester means 
any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and 
operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' 
means information that is about current events or that would be of 
current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include 
television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and 
publishers of periodicals (but only if they can qualify as disseminators 
of ``news'') that make their products available for purchase or 
subscription by the general public. For ``freelance'' journalists to be 
regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a 
solid basis for expecting publication through that organization. A 
publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the FOIA Officer 
shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making 
this determination. To be in this category, a requester must not be 
seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request 
for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester 
shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.
    (7) Review means the examination of a record located in response to 
a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from 
disclosure. It also includes processing any record for disclosure--for 
example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for 
disclosure. Review costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is 
not disclosed. Review time does not include time spent resolving general 
legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
    (8) Search means the process of looking for and retrieving records 
or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or 
line-by-line identification of information within records and also 
includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from 
records maintained in electronic form or format. The FOIA Officer shall 
ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive 
manner reasonably possible.
    (c) Fees. In responding to FOIA requests, the FOIA Officer shall 
charge the fees summarized in chart form in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) 
of this section and explained in paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of 
this section, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted 
under paragraph (k) of this section.
    (1) The four categories and chargeable fees are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Category                         Chargeable fees
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i) Commercial Use Requesters..........  Search, Review, and
                                          Duplication.

 Scientific Institution Requesters.       cost of the first 100 pages).
(iii) Representatives of the News Media   Duplication (excluding the
                                          cost of the first 100 pages).
(iv) All Other Requesters..............   Search and Duplication
                                          (excluding the cost of the
                                          first 2 hours of search and
                                          100 pages).
------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[Page 389]]

    (2) Uniform fee schedule.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Service                                Rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i) Manual search......................  Actual salary rate of employee
                                          involved, plus 16 percent of
                                          salary rate.
(ii) Computerized search...............  Actual direct cost, including
                                          operator time.
(iii) Duplication of records:

 microfiche, or microform).
(iv) Review of records (includes         Actual salary rate of employee
 preparation for release, i.e.            conducting review, plus 16
 excising).                               percent of salary rate.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Search. (i) Search fees shall be charged for all requests--other 
than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific 
institutions, or representatives of the news media--subject to the 
limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. The FOIA Officer will 
charge for time spent searching even if no responsive records are 
located or if located records are entirely exempt from disclosure. 
Search fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the search by the 
involved employees.
    (ii) For computer searches of records, requesters will be charged 
the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters 
(as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) will be charged no 
search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section) are entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of 
manual search time without charge. These direct costs include the costs, 
attributable to the search, of operating a central processing unit and 
operator/programmer salary.
    (4) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, 
subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. For a paper 
photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), 
the fee shall be $.15 cents per page. For copies produced by computer, 
such as tapes or printouts, the FOIA Officer shall charge the direct 
costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. For other forms 
of duplication, the FOIA Officer will charge the direct costs of that 
duplication.
    (5) Review. Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make a 
commercial use request. Review fees shall be charged only for the 
initial record review--the review done when the FOIA Officer determines 
whether an exemption applies to a particular record at the initial 
request level. No charge will be made for review at the administrative 
appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records withheld 
under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be 
reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously 
considered applies, and the costs of that review are chargeable. Review 
fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the review by the involved 
employees.
    (d) Limitations on charging fees.
    (1) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational 
institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives 
of the news media.
    (2) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour 
period unless more than half of that period is required for search or 
review.
    (3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, the 
FOIA Officer will provide without charge:
    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and
    (ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent).
    (4) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this 
section is $20.00 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.
    (5) The provisions of paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section 
work together. This means that for requesters other than those seeking 
records for a commercial use, no fee will be charged unless the cost of 
the search in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess 
of 100 pages totals more than $20.00.

[[Page 390]]

    (e) Notice of anticipated fees over $20.00. When the FOIA Officer 
determines or estimates that the fees to be charged under this section 
will be more than $20.00, the FOIA Officer shall notify the requester of 
the actual or estimated fees, unless the requester has indicated a 
willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion 
of the fee can be estimated readily, the FOIA Officer shall advise the 
requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. 
If the FOIA Officer has notified a requester that actual or estimated 
fees are more than $20.00, the FOIA Officer shall not consider the 
request received or process it further until the requester agrees to pay 
the anticipated total fee. Any such agreement should be in writing. A 
notice under this paragraph shall offer the requester an opportunity to 
discuss the matter with USPTO personnel in order to reformulate the 
request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
    (f) Charges for other services. Apart from the other provisions of 
this section, the FOIA Officer shall ordinarily charge the direct cost 
of special services. Such special services could include certifying that 
records are true copies or sending records by other than ordinary mail.
    (g) Charging interest. The FOIA Officer shall charge interest on any 
unpaid bill starting on the 31st calendar day following the date of 
billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate 
provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and accrue from the date of the billing until 
payment is received by the FOIA Officer. The FOIA Officer shall follow 
the provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 
104-134), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the 
use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.
    (h) Aggregating requests. If a FOIA Officer reasonably believes that 
a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to 
divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding 
fees, the FOIA Officer may aggregate those requests and charge 
accordingly. The FOIA Officer may presume that multiple requests of this 
type made within a 30-calendar-day period have been made in order to 
avoid fees. If requests are separated by a longer period, the FOIA 
Officer shall aggregate them only if a solid basis exists for 
determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances 
involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be 
aggregated.
    (i) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in 
paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section, the FOIA Officer shall not 
require the requester to make an advance payment: a payment made before 
work is begun or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already 
completed (i.e., a payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not 
an advance payment.
    (2) If the FOIA Officer determines or estimates that a total fee to 
be charged under this section will be more than $250.00, the requester 
must pay the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the 
request, unless the FOIA Officer receives a satisfactory assurance of 
full payment from a requester who has a history of prompt payment.
    (3) If a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged 
FOIA fee to USPTO or another responsible Federal agency within 30 
calendar days of the date of billing, the FOIA Officer shall require the 
requester to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and 
to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, 
before the FOIA Officer begins to process a new request or continues to 
process a pending request from that requester.
    (4) In cases in which the FOIA Officer requires payment under 
paragraphs (i)(2) or (3) of this section, the request shall not be 
considered received and further work will not be done on it until the 
required payment is received.
    (5) Upon the completion of processing of a request, when a specific 
fee is determined to be payable and appropriate notice has been given to 
the requester, the FOIA Officer shall make records available to the 
requester only upon receipt of full payment of the fee.
    (j) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule 
of this section does not apply to fees charged under

[[Page 391]]

any statute (except for FOIA) that specifically requires USPTO or 
another responsible Federal agency to set and collect fees for 
particular types of records. If records responsive to requests are 
maintained for distribution by agencies operating such statutorily based 
fee schedule programs, the FOIA Officer shall inform requesters of how 
to obtain records from those sources.
    (k) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records 
responsive to a request will be furnished without charge or at a charge 
reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section if 
the FOIA Officer determines, based on all available information, that 
the requester has demonstrated that:
    (i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public 
interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of the operations or activities of the Government; and
    (ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the 
commercial interest of the requester.
    (2) To determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, 
the FOIA Officer shall consider the following factors:
    (i) The subject of the request: whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns the operations or activities of the Government. The 
subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or 
activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct 
and clear, not remote or attenuated.
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of Government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the 
requested records must be meaningfully informative about Government 
operations or activities in order to be ``likely to contribute'' to an 
increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The 
disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in 
either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be 
likely to contribute to such understanding.
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
public likely to result from disclosure: whether disclosure of the 
requested information will contribute to the understanding of a 
reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as 
opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's 
expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively 
convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be 
presumed that a representative of the news media satisfies this 
consideration. It shall be presumed that a requester who merely provides 
information to media sources does not satisfy this consideration.
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of Government operations or activities. The 
public's understanding of the subject in question prior to the 
disclosure must be significantly enhanced by the disclosure.
    (3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement is met, 
the FOIA Officer shall consider the following factors:
    (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure. The FOIA Officer shall consider any commercial 
interest of the requester (with reference to the definition of 
``commercial use request'' in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), or of 
any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be 
furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an 
opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this 
consideration.
    (ii) The primary interest in disclosure: whether any identified 
commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in 
comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is 
``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'' A fee waiver 
or reduction is justified if the public interest standard (paragraph 
(k)(1)(i) of this section) is satisfied and the public interest is 
greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. The FOIA 
Officer ordinarily shall presume that if a news media requester has 
satisfied the public interest standard, the

[[Page 392]]

public interest is the primary interest served by disclosure to that 
requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and 
market Government information for direct economic return shall not be 
presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
    (4) If only some of the records to be released satisfy the 
requirements for a fee waiver, a waiver shall be granted for those 
records.
    (5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the 
factors listed in paragraphs (k)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as 
they apply to each request.


<R04>
                         Subpart B--Privacy Act


<R05>
Sec. 102.21  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The purpose of this subpart is to establish policies and 
procedures for implementing the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 
U.S.C. 552a) (the Act). The main objectives are to facilitate full 
exercise of rights conferred on individuals under the Act and to ensure 
the protection of privacy as to individuals on whom USPTO maintains 
records in systems of records under the Act. USPTO accepts the 
responsibility to act promptly and in accordance with the Act upon 
receipt of any inquiry, request or appeal from a citizen of the United 
States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the 
United States, regardless of the age of the individual. Further, USPTO 
accepts the obligations to maintain only such information on individuals 
as is relevant and necessary to the performance of its lawful functions, 
to maintain that information with such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, 
and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness in 
determinations made by USPTO about the individual, to obtain information 
from the individual to the extent practicable, and to take every 
reasonable step to protect that information from unwarranted disclosure. 
USPTO will maintain no record describing how an individual exercises 
rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by 
statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or 
unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law 
enforcement activity. An individual's name and address will not be sold 
or rented by USPTO unless such action is specifically authorized by law; 
however, this provision shall not be construed to require the 
withholding of names and addresses otherwise permitted to be made 
public.
    (b) This subpart is administered by the Privacy Officer of USPTO.
    (c) Matters outside the scope of this subpart include the following:
    (1) Requests for records which do not pertain to the individual 
making the request, or to the individual about whom the request is made 
if the requester is the parent or guardian of the individual;
    (2) Requests involving information pertaining to an individual which 
is in a record or file but not within the scope of a system of records 
notice published in the Federal Register;
    (3) Requests to correct a record where a grievance procedure is 
available to the individual either by regulation or by provision in a 
collective bargaining agreement with USPTO, and the individual has 
initiated, or has expressed in writing the intention of initiating, such 
grievance procedure. An individual selecting the grievance procedure 
waives the use of the procedures in this subpart to correct or amend a 
record; and,
    (4) Requests for employee-employer services and counseling which 
were routinely granted prior to enactment of the Act, including, but not 
limited to, test calculations of retirement benefits, explanations of 
health and life insurance programs, and explanations of tax withholding 
options.
    (d) Any request for records which pertains to the individual making 
the request, or to the individual about whom the request is made if the 
requester is the parent or guardian of the individual, shall be 
processed under the Act and this subpart and under the Freedom of 
Information Act and USPTO's implementing regulations at Subpart A of 
this part, regardless whether the Act or the Freedom of Information Act 
is mentioned in the request.

[[Page 393]]


<R05>
Sec. 102.22  Definitions.

    (a) All terms used in this subpart which are defined in 5 U.S.C. 
552a shall have the same meaning herein.
    (b) As used in this subpart:
    (1) Act means the ``Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 
552a)''.

initial denial of a request by that individual for correction or 
amendment.
    (3) USPTO means the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
    (4) Inquiry means either a request for general information regarding 
the Act and this subpart or a request by an individual (or that 
individual's parent or guardian) that USPTO determine whether it has any 
record in a system of records which pertains to that individual.
    (5) Person means any human being and also shall include but not be 
limited to, corporations, associations, partnerships, trustees, 
receivers, personal representatives, and public or private 
organizations.
    (6) Privacy Officer means a USPTO employee designated to administer 
this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 102.23  Procedures for making inquiries.

    (a) Any individual, regardless of age, who is a citizen of the 
United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into 
the United States may submit an inquiry to USPTO. The inquiry should be 
made either in person at Crystal Park Two, 2121 Crystal Park Drive, 
Suite 714, Arlington, Virginia, or by mail addressed to the Privacy 
Officer, United States Patent and Trademark Office, WASHINGTON DC 20231 
or to the official identified in the notification procedures paragraph 
of the systems of records notice published in the Federal Register. If 
an individual believes USPTO maintains a record pertaining to that 
individual but does not know which system of records might contain such 
a record, the USPTO Privacy Officer will provide assistance in person or 
by mail.
    (b) Inquiries submitted by mail should include the words ``PRIVACY 
ACT INQUIRY'' in capital letters at the top of the letter and on the 
face of the envelope. If the inquiry is for general information 
regarding the Act and this subpart, no particular information is 
required. USPTO reserves the right to require compliance with the 
identification procedures appearing at Sec. 102.24(d) where 
circumstances warrant. If the inquiry is a request that USPTO determine 
whether it has, in a given system of records, a record which pertains to 
the individual, the following information should be submitted:
    (1) Name of individual whose record is sought;
    (2) Individual whose record is sought is either a U.S. citizen or an 
alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence;
    (3) Identifying data that will help locate the record (for example, 
maiden name, occupational license number, period or place of employment, 
etc.);
    (4) Record sought, by description and by record system name, if 
known;
    (5) Action requested (that is, sending information on how to 
exercise rights under the Act; determining whether requested record 
exists; gaining access to requested record; or obtaining copy of 
requested record);
    (6) Copy of court guardianship order or minor's birth certificate, 
as provided in Sec. 102.24(f)(3), but only if requester is guardian or 
parent of individual whose record is sought;
    (7) Requester's name (printed), signature, address, and telephone 
number (optional);
    (8) Date; and,
    (9) Certification of request by notary or other official, but only 
if
    (i) Request is for notification that requested record exists, for 
access to requested record or for copy of requested record;
    (ii) Record is not available to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552; and

[[Page 394]]

    (iii) Requester does not appear before an employee of USPTO for 
verification of identity.
    (c) Any inquiry which is not addressed as specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section or which is not marked as specified in paragraph (b) of 
this section will be so addressed and marked by USPTO personnel and 
forwarded immediately to the Privacy Officer. An inquiry which is not 
properly addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been 
``received'' for purposes of measuring the time period for response 
until actual receipt by the Privacy Officer. In each instance when an 
inquiry so forwarded is received, the Privacy Officer shall notify the 
individual that his or her inquiry was improperly addressed and the date 
the inquiry was received at the proper address.
    (d)(1) Each inquiry received shall be acted upon promptly by the 
Privacy Officer. Every effort will be made to respond within ten working 
days (i.e., excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) of 
the date of receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten working 
days, the Privacy Officer shall send an acknowledgment during that 
period providing information on the status of the inquiry and asking for 
such further information as may be necessary to process the inquiry. The 
first correspondence sent by the Privacy Officer to the requester shall 
contain USPTO's control number assigned to the request, as well as a 
note that the requester should use that number in all future contacts in 
order to facilitate processing. USPTO shall use that control number in 
all subsequent correspondence.
    (2) If the Privacy Officer fails to send an acknowledgment within 
ten working days, as provided above, the requester may ask the General 
Counsel to take corrective action. No failure of the Privacy Officer to 
send an acknowledgment shall confer administrative finality for purposes 
of judicial review.
    (e) An individual shall not be required to state a reason or 
otherwise justify his or her inquiry.
    (f) Special note should be taken of the fact that certain agencies 
are responsible for publishing notices of systems of records having 
Government-wide application to other agencies, including USPTO. The 
agencies known to be publishing these general notices and the types of 
records covered therein appear in an appendix to this part. The 
provisions of this section, and particularly paragraph (a) of this 
section, should be followed in making inquiries with respect to such 
records. Such records in USPTO are subject to the provisions of this 
part to the extent indicated in the appendix to this part. The 
exemptions, if any, determined by an agency publishing a general notice 
shall be invoked and applied by USPTO after consultation, as necessary, 
with that other agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102.24  Procedures for making requests for records.

    (a) Any individual, regardless of age, who is a citizen of the 
United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into 
the United States may submit a request for access to records to USPTO. 
The request should be made either in person at Crystal Park Two, 2121 
Crystal Drive, Suite 714, Arlington, Virginia, or by mail addressed to 
the Privacy Officer, United States Patent and Trademark Office, 
Washington, DC 20231.
    (b) Requests submitted by mail should include the words ``PRIVACY 
ACT REQUEST'' in capital letters at the top of the letter and on the 
face of the envelope. Any request which is not addressed as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section or which is not marked as specified in 
this paragraph will be so addressed and marked by USPTO personnel and 
forwarded immediately to the Privacy Officer. A request which is not 
properly addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been 
``received'' for purposes of measuring time periods for response until 
actual receipt by the Privacy Officer. In each instance when a request 
so forwarded is received, the Privacy Officer shall notify the 
individual that his or her request was improperly addressed and the date 
when the request was received at the proper address.
    (c) If the request follows an inquiry under Sec. 102.23 in 
connection with which the individual's identity was established by 
USPTO, the individual need

[[Page 395]]

only indicate the record to which access is sought, provide the USPTO 
control number assigned to the request, and sign and date the request. 
If the request is not preceded by an inquiry under Sec. 102.23, the 
procedures of this section should be followed.
    (d) The requirements for identification of individuals seeking 
access to records are as follows:
    (1) In person. Each individual making a request in person shall be 
required to present satisfactory proof of identity. The means of proof, 
in the order of preference and priority, are:
    (i) A document bearing the individual's photograph (for example, 
driver's license, passport or military or civilian identification card);
    (ii) A document, preferably issued for participation in a federally 
sponsored program, bearing the individual's signature (for example, 
unemployment insurance book, employer's identification card, national 
credit card, and professional, craft or union membership card); and
    (iii) A document bearing neither the photograph nor the signature of 
the individual, preferably issued for participation in a federally 
sponsored program (for example, Medicaid card). In the event the 
individual can provide no suitable documentation of identity, USPTO will 
require a signed statement asserting the individual's identity and 
stipulating that the individual understands the penalty provision of 5 
U.S.C. 552a(i)(3) recited in Sec. 102.32(a). In order to avoid any 
unwarranted disclosure of an individual's records, USPTO reserves the 
right to determine the adequacy of proof of identity offered by any 
individual, particularly when the request involves a sensitive record.
    (2) Not in person. If the individual making a request does not 
appear in person before the Privacy Officer or other employee authorized 
to determine identity, a certification of a notary public or equivalent 
officer empowered to administer oaths must accompany the request under 
the circumstances prescribed in Sec. 102.23(b)(9). The certification in 
or attached to the letter must be substantially in accordance with the 
following text:

City of --------
County of -------- :ss
(Name of individual), who affixed (his) (her) signature below in my 
presence, came before me, a (title), in and for the aforesaid County and 
State, this ------ day of ------, 20--, and established (his) (her) 
identity to my satisfaction.
My commission expires --------.
(Signature)

    (3) Parents of minors and legal guardians. An individual acting as 
the parent of a minor or the legal guardian of the individual to whom a 
record pertains shall establish his or her personal identity in the same 
manner prescribed in either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. 
In addition, such other individual shall establish his or her identity 
in the representative capacity of parent or legal guardian. In the case 
of the parent of a minor, the proof of identity shall be a certified or 
authenticated copy of the minor's birth certificate. In the case of a 
legal guardian of an individual who has been declared incompetent due to 
physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent 
jurisdiction, the proof of identity shall be a certified or 
authenticated copy of the court's order. For purposes of the Act, a 
parent or legal guardian may represent only a living individual, not a 
decedent. A parent or legal guardian may be accompanied during personal 
access to a record by another individual, provided the provisions of 
Sec. 102.25(f) are satisfied.
    (e) When the provisions of this subpart are alleged to impede an 
individual in exercising his or her right to access, USPTO will 
consider, from an individual making a request, alternative suggestions 
regarding proof of identity and access to records.
    (f) An individual shall not be required to state a reason or 
otherwise justify his or her request for access to a record.


<R05>
Sec. 102.25  Disclosure of requested records to individuals.

    (a)(1) The Privacy Officer shall act promptly upon each request. 
Every effort will be made to respond within ten working days (i.e., 
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the date of 
receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten working days due to 
unusual circumstances, the Privacy Officer shall send an acknowledgment 
during that

[[Page 396]]

period providing information on the status of the request and asking for 
any further information that may be necessary to process the request. 
``Unusual circumstances'' shall include circumstances in which
    (i) A search for and collection of requested records from inactive 
storage, field facilities or other establishments is required;
    (ii) A voluminous amount of data is involved;
    (iii) Information on other individuals must be separated or expunged 
from the particular record; or
    (iv) Consultations with other agencies having a substantial interest 
in the determination of the request are necessary.
    (2) If the Privacy Officer fails to send an acknowledgment within 
ten working days, as provided above in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the requester may ask the General Counsel to take corrective action. No 
failure of the Privacy Officer to send an acknowledgment shall confer 
administrative finality for purposes of judicial review.
    (b) Grant of access--(1) Notification. An individual shall be 
granted access to a record pertaining to him or her, except where the 
provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section apply. The Privacy 
Officer will notify the individual of a determination to grant access, 
and provide the following information:
    (i) The methods of access, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section;
    (ii) The place at which the record may be inspected;
    (iii) The earliest date on which the record may be inspected and the 
period of time that the records will remain available for inspection. In 
no event shall the earliest date be later than thirty calendar days from 
the date of notification;
    (iv) The estimated date by which a copy of the record could be 
mailed and the estimate of fees pursuant to Sec. 102.31. In no event 
shall the estimated date be later than thirty calendar days from the 
date of notification;
    (v) The fact that the individual, if he or she wishes, may be 
accompanied by another individual during personal access, subject to the 
procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section; and,
    (vi) Any additional requirements needed to grant access to a 
specific record.
    (2) Methods of access. The following methods of access to records by 
an individual may be available depending on the circumstances of a given 
situation:
    (i) Inspection in person may be had in a location specified by the 
Privacy Officer during business hours;
    (ii) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to 
the individual may be arranged, but only if the Privacy Officer 
determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's 
access can be properly supervised at that facility, and that transmittal 
of the records to that facility will not unduly interfere with 
operations of USPTO or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of both 
money and manpower; and
    (iii) Copies may be mailed at the request of the individual, subject 
to payment of the fees prescribed in Sec. 102.31. USPTO, on its own 
initiative, may elect to provide a copy by mail, in which case no fee 
will be charged the individual.
    (c) Access to medical records is governed by the provisions of 
Sec. 102.26.
    (d) USPTO will supply such other information and assistance at the 
time of access as to make the record intelligible to the individual.
    (e) USPTO reserves the right to limit access to copies and abstracts 
of original records, rather than the original records. This election 
would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an automated 
data media such as tape or diskette, when the record contains 
information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is 
permissible under exemptions (for example, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)). In no 
event shall original records of USPTO be made available to the 
individual except under the immediate supervision of the Privacy Officer 
or the Privacy Officer's designee.
    (f) Any individual who requests access to a record pertaining to 
that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her 
choice. ``Accompanied'' includes discussion of the record in the 
presence of the other individual. The individual to whom the record 
pertains shall authorize the

[[Page 397]]

presence of the other individual in writing. The authorization shall 
include the name of the other individual, a specific description of the 
record to which access is sought, the USPTO control number assigned to 
the request, the date, and the signature of the individual to whom the 
record pertains. The other individual shall sign the authorization in 
the presence of the Privacy Officer. An individual shall not be required 
to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her decision to be 
accompanied by another individual during personal access to a record.
    (g) Initial denial of access--(1) Grounds. Access by an individual 
to a record which pertains to that individual will be denied only upon a 
determination by the Privacy Officer that:
    (i) The record is exempt under Sec. 102.33 or Sec. 102.34, or exempt 
by determination of another agency publishing notice of the system of 
records, as described in Sec. 102.23(f);
    (ii) The record is information compiled in reasonable anticipation 
of a civil action or proceeding;
    (iii) The provisions of Sec. 102.26 pertaining to medical records 
temporarily have been invoked; or
    (iv) The individual has unreasonably failed to comply with the 
procedural requirements of this part.
    (2) Notification. The Privacy Officer shall give notice of denial of 
access to records to the individual in writing and shall include the 
following information:
    (i) The Privacy Officer's name and title or position;
    (ii) The date of the denial;
    (iii) The reasons for the denial, including citation to the 
appropriate section of the Act and this part;
    (iv) The individual's opportunities, if any, for further 
administrative consideration, including the identity and address of the 
responsible official. If no further administrative consideration within 
USPTO is available, the notice shall state that the denial is 
administratively final; and
    (v) If stated to be administratively final within USPTO, the 
individual's right to judicial review provided under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(1), as limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(5).
    (3) Administrative review. When an initial denial of a request is 
issued by the Privacy Officer, the individual's opportunities for 
further consideration shall be as follows:
    (i) As to denial under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, two 
opportunities for further consideration are available in the 
alternative:
    (A) If the individual contests the application of the exemption to 
the records, review procedures in Sec. 102.25(g)(3)(ii) shall apply; or
    (B) If the individual challenges the exemption itself, the procedure 
is a petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule under 5 
U.S.C. 553(e). If the exemption was determined by USPTO, such petition 
shall be filed with the General Counsel. If the exemption was determined 
by another agency (as described in Sec. 102.23(f)), USPTO will provide 
the individual with the name and address of the other agency and any 
relief sought by the individual shall be that provided by the 
regulations of the other agency. Within USPTO, no such denial is 
administratively final until such a petition has been filed by the 
individual and disposed of on the merits by the General Counsel.
    (ii) As to denial under paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) of this section, 
(g)(1)(iv) of this section or (to the limited extent provided in 
paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) of this section) paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this 
section, the individual may file for review with the General Counsel, as 
indicated in the Privacy Officer's initial denial notification. The 
procedures appearing in Sec. 102.28 shall be followed by both the 
individual and USPTO to the maximum extent practicable.
    (iii) As to denial under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, no 
further administrative consideration within USPTO is available because 
the denial is not administratively final until expiration of the time 
period indicated in Sec. 102.26(a).
    (h) If a request is partially granted and partially denied, the 
Privacy Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section 
as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.

    (a) No response to any request for access to medical records by an 
individual will be issued by the Privacy Officer for a period of seven 
working days (i.e., excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public 
holidays) from the date of receipt.
    (b) USPTO has published as a routine use, for all systems of records 
containing medical records, consultations with an individual's physician 
or psychologist if, in the sole judgment of USPTO, disclosure could have 
an adverse effect upon the individual. The mandatory waiting period set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section will permit exercise of this 
routine use in appropriate cases. USPTO will pay no cost of any such 
consultation.
    (c) In every case of a request by an individual for access to 
medical records, the Privacy Officer shall:
    (1) Inform the individual of the waiting period prescribed in 
paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) Obtain the name and address of the individual's physician and/or 
psychologist, if the individual consents to give them;
    (3) Obtain specific, written consent for USPTO to consult the 
individual's physician and/or psychologist in the event that USPTO 
believes such consultation is advisable, if the individual consents to 
give such authorization;
    (4) Obtain specific, written consent for USPTO to provide the 
medical records to the individual's physician or psychologist in the 
event that USPTO believes access to the record by the individual is best 
effected under the guidance of the individual's physician or 
psychologist, if the individual consents to give such authorization; and
    (5) Forward the individual's medical record to USPTO's medical 
expert for review and a determination on whether consultation with or 
transmittal of the medical records to the individual's physician or 
psychologist is warranted. If the consultation with or transmittal of 
such records to the individual's physician or psychologist is determined 
to be warranted, USPTO's medical expert shall so consult or transmit. 
Whether or not such a consultation or transmittal occurs, USPTO's 
medical officer shall provide instruction to the Privacy Officer 
regarding the conditions of access by the individual to his or her 
medical records.
    (d) If an individual refuses in writing to give the names and 
consents set forth in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section 
and USPTO has determined that disclosure could have an adverse effect 
upon the individual, USPTO shall give the individual access to said 
records by means of a copy, provided without cost to the requester, sent 
registered mail return receipt requested.


<R05>
Sec. 102.27  Procedures for making requests for correction or amendment.

    (a) Any individual, regardless of age, who is a citizen of the 
United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into 
the United States may submit a request for correction or amendment to 
USPTO. The request should be made either in person or by mail addressed 
to the Privacy Officer who processed the individual's request for access 
to the record, and to whom is delegated authority to make initial 
determinations on requests for correction or amendment. The office of 
the Privacy Officer is open to the public between the hours of 9 a.m. 
and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding legal public holidays).
    (b) Requests submitted by mail should include the words ``PRIVACY 
ACT REQUEST'' in capital letters at the top of the letter and on the 
face of the envelope. Any request which is not addressed as specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section or which is not marked as specified in 
this paragraph will be so addressed and marked by USPTO personnel and 
forwarded immediately to the Privacy Officer. A request which is not 
properly addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been 
``received'' for purposes of measuring the time period for response 
until actual receipt by the Privacy Officer. In each instance when a 
request so forwarded is received, the Privacy Officer shall notify the 
individual that his or her request was improperly addressed and the date 
the request was received at the proper address.

[[Page 399]]

    (c) Since the request, in all cases, will follow a request for 
access under Sec. 102.25, the individual's identity will be established 
by his or her signature on the request and use of the USPTO control 
number assigned to the request.
    (d) A request for correction or amendment should include the 
following:
    (1) Specific identification of the record sought to be corrected or 
amended (for example, description, title, date, paragraph, sentence, 
line and words);
    (2) The specific wording to be deleted, if any;
    (3) The specific wording to be inserted or added, if any, and the 
exact place at which to be inserted or added; and
    (4) A statement of the basis for the requested correction or 
amendment, with all available supporting documents and materials which 
substantiate the statement. The statement should identify the criterion 
of the Act being invoked, that is, whether the information in the record 
is unnecessary, inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely or incomplete.


<R05>
Sec. 102.28  Review of requests for correction or amendment.

    (a)(1)(i) Not later than ten working days (i.e., excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after receipt of a request 
to correct or amend a record, the Privacy Officer shall send an 
acknowledgment providing an estimate of time within which action will be 
taken on the request and asking for such further information as may be 
necessary to process the request. The estimate of time may take into 
account unusual circumstances as described in Sec. 102.25(a). No 
acknowledgment will be sent if the request can be reviewed, processed, 
and the individual notified of the results of review (either compliance 
or denial) within the ten working days. Requests filed in person will be 
acknowledged in writing at the time submitted.
    (ii) If the Privacy Officer fails to send the acknowledgment within 
ten working days, as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, 
the requester may ask the General Counsel to take corrective action. No 
failure of the Privacy Officer to send an acknowledgment shall confer 
administrative finality for purposes of judicial review.
    (2) Promptly after acknowledging receipt of a request, or after 
receiving such further information as might have been requested, or 
after arriving at a decision within the ten working days, the Privacy 
Officer shall either:
    (i) Make the requested correction or amendment and advise the 
individual in writing of such action, providing either a copy of the 
corrected or amended record or a statement as to the means whereby the 
correction or amendment was effected in cases where a copy cannot be 
provided (for example, erasure of information from a record maintained 
only in magnetically recorded computer files); or
    (ii) Inform the individual in writing that his or her request is 
denied and provide the following information:
    (A) The Privacy Officer's name and title or position;
    (B) The date of the denial;
    (C) The reasons for the denial, including citation to the 
appropriate sections of the Act and this subpart; and
    (D) The procedures for appeal of the denial as set forth in 
Sec. 102.29, including the address of the General Counsel.
    (3) The term promptly in this section means within thirty working 
days (i.e., excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If 
the Privacy Officer cannot make the determination within thirty working 
days, the individual will be advised in writing of the reason therefor 
and of the estimated date by which the determination will be made.
    (b) Whenever an individual's record is corrected or amended pursuant 
to a request by that individual, the Privacy Officer shall be 
responsible for notifying all persons and agencies to which the 
corrected or amended portion of the record had been disclosed prior to 
its correction or amendment, if an accounting of such disclosure 
required by the Act was made. The notification shall require a recipient 
agency maintaining the record to acknowledge receipt of the 
notification, to correct or amend the record, and to apprise any agency 
or person to which it had disclosed the record of the substance of the 
correction or amendment.

[[Page 400]]

    (c) The following criteria will be considered by the Privacy Officer 
in reviewing a request for correction or amendment:
    (1) The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual;
    (2) The factual accuracy of the information;
    (3) The relevance and necessity of the information in terms of 
purpose for which it was collected;
    (4) The timeliness and currency of the information in light of the 
purpose for which it was collected;
    (5) The completeness of the information in terms of the purpose for 
which it was collected;
    (6) The degree of risk that denial of the request could unfairly 
result in determinations adverse to the individual;
    (7) The character of the record sought to be corrected or amended; 
and
    (8) The propriety and feasibility of complying with the specific 
means of correction or amendment requested by the individual.
    (d) USPTO will not undertake to gather evidence for the individual, 
but does reserve the right to verify the evidence which the individual 
submits.
    (e) Correction or amendment of a record requested by an individual 
will be denied only upon a determination by the Privacy Officer that:
    (1) The individual has failed to establish, by a preponderance of 
the evidence, the propriety of the correction or amendment in light of 
the criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section;
    (2) The record sought to be corrected or amended is part of the 
official record in a terminated judicial, quasi-judicial, or quasi-
legislative proceeding to which the individual was a party or 
participant;
    (3) The information in the record sought to be corrected or amended, 
or the record sought to be corrected or amended, is the subject of a 
pending judicial, quasi-judicial, or quasi-legislative proceeding to 
which the individual is a party or participant;
    (4) The correction or amendment would violate a duly enacted statute 
or promulgated regulation; or
    (5) The individual has unreasonably failed to comply with the 
procedural requirements of this part.
    (f) If a request is partially granted and partially denied, the 
Privacy Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section 
as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.


<R05>
Sec. 102.29  Appeal of initial adverse determination on correction or amendment.

    (a) When a request for correction or amendment has been denied 
initially under Sec. 102.28, the individual may submit a written appeal 
within thirty working days (i.e., excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal 
public holidays) after the date of the initial denial. When an appeal is 
submitted by mail, the postmark is conclusive as to timeliness.
    (b) An appeal should be addressed to the General Counsel, United 
States Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, DC 20231. An appeal 
should include the words ``PRIVACY APPEAL'' in capital letters at the 
top of the letter and on the face of the envelope. An appeal not 
addressed and marked as provided herein will be so marked by USPTO 
personnel when it is so identified and will be forwarded immediately to 
the General Counsel. An appeal which is not properly addressed by the 
individual will not be deemed to have been ``received'' for purposes of 
measuring the time periods in this section until actual receipt by the 
General Counsel. In each instance when an appeal so forwarded is 
received, the General Counsel shall notify the individual that his or 
her appeal was improperly addressed and the date when the appeal was 
received at the proper address.
    (c) The individual's appeal shall include a statement of the reasons 
why the initial denial is believed to be in error and USPTO's control 
number assigned to the request. The appeal shall be signed by the 
individual. The record which the individual requests be corrected or 
amended and all correspondence between the Privacy Officer and the 
requester will be furnished by the Privacy Officer who issued the 
initial denial. Although the foregoing normally will comprise the entire 
record on appeal, the General Counsel may seek additional information 
necessary to assure that the final determination

[[Page 401]]

is fair and equitable and, in such instances, disclose the additional 
information to the individual to the greatest extent possible, and 
provide an opportunity for comment thereon.
    (d) No personal appearance or hearing on appeal will be allowed.
    (e) The General Counsel shall act upon the appeal and issue a final 
determination in writing not later than thirty working days (i.e., 
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) from the date on 
which the appeal is received, except that the General Counsel may extend 
the thirty days upon deciding that a fair and equitable review cannot be 
made within that period, but only if the individual is advised in 
writing of the reason for the extension and the estimated date by which 
a final determination will issue. The estimated date should not be later 
than the sixtieth working day after receipt of the appeal unless unusual 
circumstances, as described in Sec. 102.25(a), are met.
    (f) If the appeal is determined in favor of the individual, the 
final determination shall include the specific corrections or amendments 
to be made and a copy thereof shall be transmitted promptly both to the 
individual and to the Privacy Officer who issued the initial denial. 
Upon receipt of such final determination, the Privacy Officer promptly 
shall take the actions set forth in Sec. 102.28(a)(2)(i) and (b).
    (g) If the appeal is denied, the final determination shall be 
transmitted promptly to the individual and state the reasons for the 
denial. The notice of final determination also shall inform the 
individual of the following:
    (1) The right of the individual under the Act to file a concise 
statement of reasons for disagreeing with the final determination. The 
statement ordinarily should not exceed one page and USPTO reserves the 
right to reject a statement of excessive length. Such a statement shall 
be filed with the General Counsel. It should provide the USPTO control 
number assigned to the request, indicate the date of the final 
determination and be signed by the individual. The General Counsel shall 
acknowledge receipt of such statement and inform the individual of the 
date on which it was received.
    (2) The facts that any such disagreement statement filed by the 
individual will be noted in the disputed record, that the purposes and 
uses to which the statement will be put are those applicable to the 
record in which it is noted, and that a copy of the statement will be 
provided to persons and agencies to which the record is disclosed 
subsequent to the date of receipt of such statement;
    (3) The fact that USPTO will append to any such disagreement 
statement filed by the individual, a copy of the final determination or 
summary thereof which also will be provided to persons and agencies to 
which the disagreement statement is disclosed; and,
    (4) The right of the individual to judicial review of the final 
determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A), as limited by 5 U.S.C. 
552a(g)(5).
    (h) In making the final determination, the General Counsel shall 
employ the criteria set forth in Sec. 102.28(c) and shall deny an appeal 
only on the grounds set forth in Sec. 102.28(e).
    (i) If an appeal is partially granted and partially denied, the 
General Counsel shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section 
as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.
    (j) Although a copy of the final determination or a summary thereof 
will be treated as part of the individual's record for purposes of 
disclosure in instances where the individual has filed a disagreement 
statement, it will not be subject to correction or amendment by the 
individual.
    (k) The provisions of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(3) of this 
section satisfy the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3).


<R05>

shall make reasonable efforts to notify any individual when any record 
in a system of records is disclosed to any person under compulsory legal 
process, promptly upon being informed that such process has become a 
matter of public record.


<R05>
Sec. 102.31  Fees.

    The only fees to be charged to or collected from an individual under 
the provisions of this part are for duplication of records at the 
request of the individual. The Privacy Officer shall charge fees for 
duplication of records under the Act in the same way in which they 
charge duplication fees under Sec. 102.11, except as provided in this 
section.

[[Page 403]]

    (a) No fees shall be charged or collected for the following: Search 
for and retrieval of the records; review of the records; copying at the

transportation of records and personnel; and first-class postage.
    (b) It is the policy of USPTO to provide an individual with one copy 
of each record corrected or amended pursuant to his or her request 
without charge as evidence of the correction or amendment.
    (c) As required by the United States Office of Personnel Management 
in its published regulations implementing the Act, USPTO will charge no

Government-wide published notice of systems of records.


<R05>
Sec. 102.32  Penalties.

    (a) The Act provides, in pertinent part:

    Any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any

    (b) A person who falsely or fraudulently attempts to obtain records 
under the Act also may be subject to prosecution under such other 
criminal statutes as 18 U.S.C. 494, 495 and 1001.


<R05>
Sec. 102.33  General exemptions.

    (a) Individuals may not have access to records maintained by USPTO 
but which were provided by another agency which has determined by 
regulation that such information is subject to general exemption under 5 
U.S.C. 552a(j). If such exempt records are within a request for access, 
USPTO will advise the individual of their existence and of the name and 
address of the source agency. For any further information concerning the 
record and the exemption, the individual must contact that source 
agency.
    (b) The general exemption determined to be necessary and proper with 
respect to systems of records maintained by USPTO, including the parts 
of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they 
are exempted, and the justification for the exemption, is as follows: 
Investigative Records--Contract and Grant Frauds and Employee Criminal 
Misconduct--COMMERCE/DEPT.--12. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), these 
records are hereby determined to be exempt from all provisions of the 
Act, except 5 U.S.C. 552a (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), 
(e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i). These exemptions are 
necessary to ensure the proper functions of the law enforcement 
activity, to protect confidential sources of information, to fulfill 
promises of confidentiality, to prevent interference with law 
enforcement proceedings, to avoid the disclosure of investigative 
techniques, to avoid the endangering of law enforcement personnel, to 
avoid premature disclosure of the knowledge of criminal activity and the 
evidentiary bases of possible enforcement actions, and to maintain the 
integrity of the law enforcement process.


<R05>
Sec. 102.34  Specific exemptions.

    (a)(1) Some systems of records under the Act which are maintained by 
USPTO contain, from time-to-time, material subject to the exemption 
appearing at 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), relating to national defense and 
foreign policy materials. The systems of records published in the 
Federal Register by USPTO which are within this exemption are: COMMERCE/
PAT-TM-6, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-7, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-8, COMMERCE/PAT-TM-9.
    (2) USPTO hereby asserts a claim to exemption of such materials 
wherever they might appear in such systems of records, or any systems of 
records, at present or in the future. The materials would be exempt from 
5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f) to 
protect materials required by Executive order to be kept secret in the 
interest of the national defense and foreign policy.
    (b) The specific exemptions determined to be necessary and proper 
with respect to systems of records maintained by USPTO, including the 
parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from 
which they are exempted, and the justification for the exemption, are as 
follows:
    (1)(i) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The systems of records 
exempt (some only conditionally), the

[[Page 404]]

sections of the Act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as 
follows:
    (A) Investigative Records--Contract and Grant Frauds and Employee 
Criminal Misconduct--COMMERCE/DEPT-12, but only on condition that the 
general exemption claimed in Sec. 102.33(b)(3) is held to be invalid;
    (B) Investigative Records--Persons Within the Investigative 
Jurisdiction of USPTO--COMMERCE/DEPT-13;
    (C) Litigation, Claims and Administrative Proceeding Records-- 
COMMERCE/DEPT-14;
    (D) Attorneys and Agents Registered to Practice Before the Office-- 
COMMERCE/PAT-TM-1;
    (E) Complaints, Investigations and Disciplinary Proceedings Relating 
to Registered Patent Attorneys and Agents--COMMERCE/PAT-TM-2; and
    (F) Non-Registered Persons Rendering Assistance to Patent 
Applicants-- COMMERCE/PAT-TM-5.
    (ii) The foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), 
(e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the 
exemption are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the 
investigatory process, to insure the proper functioning and integrity of 
law enforcement activities, to prevent disclosure of investigative 
techniques, to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information, to 
fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the 
confidentiality of information and to avoid endangering these sources 
and law enforcement personnel. Special note is taken of the fact that 
the proviso clause in this exemption imports due process and procedural 
protections for the individual. The existence and general character of 
the information exempted will be made known to the individual to whom it 
pertains.
    (2)(i) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). The systems of records 
exempt (some only conditionally), the sections of the act from which 
exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:
    (A) Investigative Records--Contract and Grant Frauds and Employee 
Criminal Misconduct--COMMERCE/DEPT-12, but only on condition that the 
general exemption claimed in Sec. 102.33(b)(3) is held to be invalid;
    (B) Investigative Records--Persons Within the Investigative 
Jurisdiction of USPTO--COMMERCE/DEPT-13; and
    (C) Litigation, Claims, and Administrative Proceeding Records-- 
COMMERCE/DEPT-14.
    (ii) The foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), 
(e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the 
exemption are to maintain the ability to obtain candid and necessary 
information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect the 
confidentiality of information, to avoid endangering these sources and, 
ultimately, to facilitate proper selection or continuance of the best 
applicants or persons for a given position or contract. Special note is 
made of the limitation on the extent to which this exemption may be 
asserted. The existence and general character of the information 
exempted will be made known to the individual to whom it pertains.
    (c) At the present time, USPTO claims no exemption under 5 U.S.C. 
552a(k) (3), (4), (6) and (7).

summons and complaint is served on the Office or on the Director or an 
employee in his or her official capacity.
    (b) This subpart is intended, and should be construed, to ensure the 
efficient administration of the Office and not to impede any legal

<R04>
   Subpart C--Employee Testimony and Production of Documents in Legal 
                               Proceedings


<R05>
Sec. 104.21  Scope and purpose.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the policies and procedures of the 
Office regarding the testimony of employees as witnesses in legal 
proceedings and the production or disclosure of information contained in 
Office documents for use in legal proceedings pursuant to a demand.
    (b) Exceptions. This subpart does not apply to any legal proceeding 
in which:
    (1) An employee is to testify regarding facts or events that are 
unrelated to official business; or
    (2) A former employee is to testify as an expert in connection with 
a particular matter in which the former employee did not participate 
personally while at the Office.


<R05>
Sec. 104.22  Demand for testimony or production of documents.

    (a) Whenever a demand for testimony or for the production of 
documents is made upon an employee, the employee shall immediately 
notify the Office of the General Counsel at the telephone number or 
addresses in Sec. 104.2 and make arrangements to send the subpoena to 
the General Counsel promptly.
    (b) An employee may not give testimony, produce documents, or answer 
inquiries from a person not employed by the Office regarding testimony 
or documents subject to a demand or a potential demand under the 
provisions of this subpart without the approval of the General Counsel. 
The General Counsel may authorize the provision of certified copies not 
otherwise available under Part 1 of this title subject to payment of 
applicable fees under Sec. 1.19.
    (c)(1) Demand for testimony or documents. A demand for the testimony 
of an employee under this subpart shall be addressed to the General 
Counsel as indicated in Sec. 104.2.
    (2) Subpoenas. A subpoena for employee testimony or for a document 
shall be served in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil or 
Criminal Procedure or applicable state procedure, and a copy of the 
subpoena shall be sent to the General Counsel as indicated in 
Sec. 104.2.
    (3) Affidavits. Except when the United States is a party, every 
demand shall be accompanied by an affidavit or declaration under 28 
U.S.C. 1746 or 35 U.S.C. 25(b) setting forth the title of the legal 
proceeding, the forum, the requesting party's interest in the legal 
proceeding, the reason for the demand, a showing that the desired 
testimony or document is not reasonably available from any other source, 
and, if testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony, a 
general summary of the desired testimony, and a showing that no document 
could be provided and used in lieu of testimony.
    (d) Failure of the attorney to cooperate in good faith to enable the 
General Counsel to make an informed determination under this subpart may 
serve as a basis for a determination not to comply with the demand.
    (e) A determination under this subpart to comply or not to comply 
with a demand is not a waiver or an assertion of any other ground for 
noncompliance, including privilege, lack of relevance, or technical 
deficiency.
    (f) Noncompliance. If the General Counsel makes a determination not 
to comply, he or she will seek Department of Justice representation for 
the employee and will attempt to have the subpoena modified or quashed. 
If Department of Justice representation cannot be arranged, the employee 
should appear at the time and place set forth in the subpoena. In such a 
case, the employee should produce a copy of these rules and state that 
the General Counsel has advised the employee not to provide the 
requested testimony nor to produce the requested document. If a legal 
tribunal rules that the demand in the subpoena must be complied with, 
the employee shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand, 
citing United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).


<R05>
Sec. 104.23  Expert or opinion testimony.

    (a)(1) If the General Counsel authorizes an employee to give 
testimony in a legal proceeding not involving the United States, the 
testimony, if otherwise proper, shall be limited to facts within the 
personal knowledge of the employee. Employees, with or without 
compensation, shall not provide expert

[[Page 408]]

testimony in any legal proceedings regarding Office information, 
subjects, or activities except on behalf of the United States or a party 
represented by the United States Department of Justice.
    (2) The General Counsel may authorize an employee to appear and give 
the expert or opinion testimony upon the requester showing, pursuant to 
Sec. 104.3 of this part, that exceptional circumstances warrant such 
testimony and that the anticipated testimony will not be adverse to the 
interest of the Office or the United States.
    (b)(1) If, while testifying in any legal proceeding, an employee is 
asked for expert or opinion testimony regarding Office information, 
subjects, or activities, which testimony has not been approved in 
advance in writing in accordance with the regulations in this subpart, 
the witness shall:
    (i) Respectfully decline to answer on the grounds that such expert 
or opinion testimony is forbidden by this subpart;
    (ii) Request an opportunity to consult with the General Counsel 
before giving such testimony; and
    (iii) Explain that upon such consultation, approval for such 
testimony may be provided.
    (2) If the tribunal conducting the proceeding then orders the 
employee to provide expert or opinion testimony regarding Office 
information, subjects, or activities without the opportunity to consult 
with the General Counsel, the employee shall respectfully refuse to 
provide such testimony, citing United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 
U.S. 462 (1951).
    (c) If an employee is unaware of the regulations in this subpart and 
provides expert or opinion testimony regarding Office information, 
subjects, or activities in a legal proceeding without the aforementioned 
consultation, the employee shall, as soon after testifying as possible, 
inform the General Counsel that such testimony was given and provide a 
written summary of the expert or opinion testimony provided.
    (d) Proceeding where the United States is a party. In a proceeding 
in which the United States is a party or is representing a party, an 
employee may not testify as an expert or opinion witness for any party 
other than the United States.

the testimony of employees regarding information protected by the 
confidentiality provisions of the Patent Act (35 U.S.C. 122), the 
Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Trade Secrets Act (18 U.S.C. 1905), or 
any other confidentiality statute, must satisfy the requirements for 
disclosure set forth in those statutes and associated rules before the 
records may be provided or testimony given.


<R04>
                   Subpart D--Employee Indemnification


<R05>
Sec. 104.31  Scope.

    The procedure in this subpart shall be followed if a civil action or 
proceeding is brought, in any court, against an employee (including the 
employee's estate) for personal injury, loss of property, or death, 
resulting from the employee's activities while acting within the scope 
of the employee's office or employment. When the employee is 
incapacitated or deceased, actions required of an employee should be 
performed by the employee's executor, administrator, or comparable legal 
representative.


<R05>
Sec. 104.32  Procedure for requesting indemnification.

    (a) After being served with process or pleadings in such an action 
or proceeding, the employee shall within five (5) calendar days of 
receipt, deliver to the General Counsel all such process and pleadings 
or an attested true copy thereof, together with a fully detailed report 
of the circumstances of the incident giving rise to the court action or 
proceeding.
    (b)(1) An employee may request indemnification to satisfy a verdict, 
judgment, or award entered against that employee only if the employee 
has timely satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) No request for indemnification will be considered unless the 
employee has submitted a written request

[[Page 409]]

through the employee's supervisory chain to the General Counsel with:

judgment, appeal bond, award, or settlement proposal;

Sec. 201.2  Information given by the Copyright Office.

    (a) In general. (1) Information relative to the operations of the 
Copyright Office is supplied without charge. A search of the records, 
indexes, and deposits will be made for such information as they may 
contain relative to copyright claims upon application and payment of the 
statutory fee. The Copyright Office, however, does not undertake the 
making of comparisons of copyright deposits to determine similarity 
between works.
    (2) The Copyright Office does not furnish the names of copyright 
attorneys, publishers, agents, or other similar information.
    (3) In the administration of the Copyright Act in general, the 
Copyright Office interprets the Act. The Copyright Office, however, does 
not give specific legal advice on the rights of persons, whether in 
connection with particular uses of copyrighted works, cases of alleged 
foreign or domestic copyright infringement, contracts between authors 
and publishers, or other matters of a similar nature.
    (b) Inspection and copying of records. (1) Inspection and copying of 
completed records and indexes relating to a registration or a recorded 
document, and inspection of copies or identifying material deposited in 
connection with a completed copyright registration may be undertaken in 
the Certifications and Documents Section. Since some of these materials 
are not stored on the immediate premises of the Copyright

[[Page 417]]

Office, it is advisable to consult the Certifications and Documents 
Section to determine the length of time necessary to produce the 
requested materials.
    (2) It is the general policy of the Copyright Office to deny direct 
public access to in-process files and to any work (or other) areas where 
they are kept. However, direct public use of computers intended to 
access the automated equivalent of limited portions of these files is 
permitted on a specified terminal in the Records Maintenance Unit, LM B-
14, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, upon payment of 
applicable fees.
    (3) Information contained in Copyright Office in-process files may 
be obtained by anyone upon payment of applicable fees and request to the 
Information and Reference Division, in accordance with the following 
procedures:
    (i) In general, all requests by the public for information in the 
in-process and open unfinished business files should be made to the 
Certifications and Documents Section, which upon receipt of applicable 
fees will give a report that provides the following for each request:
    (A) The date(s) of receipt of:
    (1) The application(s) for registration that may have been submitted 
and is (are) in process;
    (2) The document(s) that may have been submitted for recordation and 
is (are) in process;
    (3) The copy or copies (or phonorecords) that may have been 
submitted;
    (B) The title of the work(s); and
    (C) The name of the remitter.
    (ii) Such searches of the in-process files will be given priority to 
the extent permitted by the demands of normal work flow of the affected 
sections of the Copyright Office.
    (4) Access will be afforded as follows to pending applications for 
registration, the deposit material accompanying them, and pending 
documents for recordation that were submitted within the twelve month 
period immediately preceding the request for access:
    (i) In the case of applications for registration and deposits 
accompanying them, upon the request of the copyright claimant or his/her 
authorized representative, and
    (ii) In the case of documents, upon the request of at least one of 
the persons who executed the document or by an authorized representative 
of that person.

These requests should be made to the Public Information Office, and the 
review of the materials will be permitted there. No charge will be made 
for reviewing these materials; the appropriate search fee identified in 
Sec. 201.3(c) or Sec. 201.3(d) will be assessed, and the appropriate 
copying fee identified in Sec. 201.3(c) or Sec. 201.3(d) will be 
assessed if the claimant wants and is entitled to a copy of the 
material.
    (5) In exceptional circumstances, the Register of Copyrights may 
allow inspection of pending applications and open correspondence files 
by someone other than the copyright claimant, upon submission of a 
written request which is deemed by the Register to show good cause for 
such access and establishes that the person making the request is one 
properly and directly concerned. The written request should be addressed 
to Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. Box 70400, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 
20024.
    (6) In no case will direct public access be permitted to any 
financial or accounting records.
    (7) The Copyright Office maintains administrative staff manuals 
referred to as its ``Compendium of Office Practices I'' and ``Compendium 
of Office Practices II'' for the general guidance of its staff in making 
registrations and recording documents. The manuals, as amended and 
supplemented from time to time, are available for purchase from the 
National Technical Information Service (Compendium I) and the Government 
Printing Office (Compendium II). They are also available for public 
inspection and copying in the Certifications and Documents Section.
    (c) Correspondence. (1) Official correspondence, including 
preliminary applications, between copyright claimants or their agents 
and the Copyright

[[Page 418]]

Office, and directly relating to a completed registration, a recorded 
document, a rejected application for registration, or a document for 
which recordation was refused is available for public inspection. 
Included in the correspondence available for public inspection is that 
portion of the file directly relating to a completed registration, 
recorded document, a rejected application for registration, or a 
document for which recordation was refused which was once open to public 
inspection as a closed case, even if the case is subsequently reopened. 
Public inspection is available only for the correspondence contained in 
the file during the time it was closed because of one of the 
aforementioned actions. Correspondence relating to the reopening of the 
file and reconsideration of the case is considered part of an in-process 
file until final action is taken, and public inspection of that 
correspondence is governed by Sec. 201.2(b). Requests for reproductions 
of the correspondence shall be made pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) Correspondence, application forms, and any accompanying material 
forming a part of a pending application are considered in-process files 
and access to them is governed by paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) Correspondence, memoranda, reports, opinions, and similar 
material relating to internal matters of personnel and procedures, 
office administration, security matters, and internal consideration of 
policy and decisional matters including the work product of an attorney, 
are not open to public inspection.
    (4) The Copyright Office will return unanswered any abusive or 
scurrilous correspondence.
    (d) Requests for copies. (1) Requests for copies of records should 
include the following:
    (i) A clear identification of the type of records desired (for 
example, additional certificates of registration, copies of 
correspondence, copies of deposits).
    (ii) A specification of whether the copies are to be certified or 
uncertified.
    (iii) A clear identification of the specific records to be copied. 
Requests should include the following specific information, if possible:
    (A) The type of work involved (for example, novel, lyrics, 
photograph);
    (B) The registration number;
    (C) The year date or approximate year date of registration;
    (D) The complete title of the work;
    (E) The author(s) including any pseudonym by which the author may be

    (F) The claimant(s); and
    (G) If the requested copy is of an assignment, license, contract, or 
other recorded document, the volume and page number of the recorded 
document.
    (iv) If the copy requested is an additional certificate of 
registration, include the fee. The Certifications and Documents Section 
will review requests for copies of other records and quote fees for 
each.
    (v) The telephone number and address of the requestor.
    (2) Requests for certified or uncertified reproductions of the 
copies, phonorecords, or identifying material deposited in connection 
with a copyright registration of published or unpublished works in the 
custody of the Copyright Office will be granted only when one of the 
following three conditions has been met:
    (i) The Copyright Office receives written authorization from the 
copyright claimant of record or his or her designated agent, or from the 
owner of any of the exclusive rights in the copyright as long as this 
ownership can be demonstrated by written documentation of the transfer 
of ownership.
    (ii) The Copyright Office receives a written request from an 
attorney on behalf of either the plaintiff or defendant in connection 
with litigation, actual or prospective, involving the copyrighted work. 
The following information must be included in such a request:
    (A) The names of all the parties involved and the nature of the 
controversy;
    (B) The name of the court in which the actual case is pending or, in 
the case of a prospective proceeding, a full statement of the facts of 
the controversy in which the copyrighted work is involved; and

[[Page 419]]

    (C) Satisfactory assurance that the requested reproduction will be 
used only in connection with the specified litigation.
    (iii) The Copyright Office receives a court order for reproduction 
of the deposited copies, phonorecords, or identifying material of a 
registered work which is the subject of litigation. The order must be 
issued by a court having jurisdiction of the case in which the 
reproduction is to be submitted as evidence.
    (3) When a request is made for a reproduction of a phonorecord, such 
as an audiotape or cassette, in which either a sound recording or the 
underlying musical, dramatic, or literary work is embodied, the 
Copyright Office will provide proximate reproduction. The Copyright 
Office reserves the right to substitute a monaural reproduction for a 
stereo, quadraphonic, or any other type of fixation of the work accepted 
for deposit.

Sec. 201.4  Recordation of transfers and certain other documents.

    (a) General. (1) This section prescribes conditions for the 
recordation of transfers of copyright ownership and other documents 
pertaining to a copyright under section 205 of title 17 of the United 
States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553. The filing or recordation of 
the following documents is not within the provisions of this section:
    (i) Certain contracts entered into by cable systems located outside 
of the 48 contiguous States (17 U.S.C. 111(e); see 37 CFR 201.12);
    (ii) Notices of identity and signal carriage complement, and 
statements of account, of cable systems (17 U.S.C. 111(d); see 37 CFR 
201.11; 201.17);
    (iii) Original, signed notices of intention to obtain compulsory 
license to make and distribute phonorecords of nondramatic musical works 
(17 U.S.C. 115(b); see 37 CFR 201.18);
    (iv) License agreements, and terms and rates of royalty payments, 
voluntarily negotiated between one or more public broadcasting entities 
and certain owners of copyright (17 U.S.C. 118; see 37 CFR 201.9);
    (v) Notices of termination (17 U.S.C. 203, 304(c); see 37 CFR 
201.10); and
    (vi) Statements regarding the identity of authors of anonymous and 
pseudonymous works, and statements relating to the death of authors (17 
U.S.C. 302).
    (2) A transfer of copyright ownership has the meaning set forth in 
section 101 of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 
94-553. A document shall be considered to ``pertain to a copyright'' if 
it has a direct or indirect relationship to the existence, scope, 
duration, or identification of a copyright, or to the ownership, 
division, allocation, licensing, transfer, or exercise of rights under a 
copyright. That

[[Page 421]]

relationship may be past, present, future, or potential.
    (3) For purposes of this section:
    (i) A sworn certification is an affidavit under the official seal of 
any officer authorized to administer oaths within the United States, or 
if the original is located outside of the United States, under the 
official seal of any diplomatic or consular officer of the United States 
or of a person authorized to administer oaths whose authority is proved 
by the certificate of such an officer, or a statement in accordance with 
section 1746 of title 28 of the United States Code; and
    (ii) An official certification is a certification, by the 
appropriate Government official, that the original of the document is on 
file in a public office and that the reproduction is a true copy or the 
original.
    (b) Forms. The Copyright Office does not provide forms for the use 
of persons recording documents.
    (c) Recordable documents. Any transfer of copyright ownership 
(including any instrument of conveyance, or note or memorandum of the 
transfer), or any other document pertaining to a copyright, may be 
recorded in the Copyright Office if it is accompanied by the fee set 
forth in paragraph (d) of this section, and if the requirements of this 
paragraph with respect to signatures, completeness, and legibility are 
met.
    (1) To be recordable, the document must bear the actual signature or 
signatures of the person or persons who executed it. Alternatively, the 
document may be recorded if it is a legible photocopy or other legible 
facsimile reproduction of the signed document, accompanied by a sworn 
certification or an official certification that the reproduction is a 
true copy of the signed document. Any sworn certification accompanying a 
reproduction shall be signed by at least one of the parties to the 
signed document, or by an authorized representative of that person.
    (2) To be recordable, the document must be complete by its own 
terms.
    (i) A document that contains a reference to any schedule, appendix, 
exhibit, addendum, or other material as being attached to the document 
or made a part of it shall be recordable only if the attachment is also 
submitted for recordation with the document or if the reference is 
deleted by the parties to the document. If a document has been submitted 
for recordation and has been returned by the Copyright Office at the 
request of the sender for deletion of the reference to an attachment, 
the document will be recorded only if the deletion is signed or 
initialed by the persons who executed the document or by their 
authorized representatives. In exceptional cases a document containing a 
reference to an attachment will be recorded without the attached 
material and without deletion of the reference if the person seeking 
recordation submits a written request specifically asserting that:
    (A) The attachment is completely unavailable for recordation; and
    (B) The attachment is not essential to the identification of the 
subject matter of the document; and
    (C) It would be impossible or wholly impracticable to have the 
parties to the document sign or initial a deletion of the reference.

In such exceptional cases, the Copyright Office records of the document 
will be annotated to show that recordation was made in response to a 
specific request under this paragraph.
    (ii) If a document otherwise recordable under this title indicates 
on its face that it is a self-contained part of a larger instrument (for 
example: if it is designated ``Attachment A'' or ``Exhibit B''), the 
Copyright Office will raise the question of completeness, but will 
record the document if the person requesting recordation asserts that 
the document is sufficiently complete as it stands.
    (iii) When the document submitted for recordation merely identifies 
or incorporates by reference another document, or certain terms of 
another document, the Copyright Office will raise no question of 
completeness, and will not require recordation of the other document.
    (3) To be recordable, the document must be legible and capable of 
being reproduced in legible microform copies.
    (d) Fees. The fees for recordation of a document are prescribed in 
Sec. 201.3(c).

[[Page 422]]

    (e) Recordation. The date of recordation is the date when a proper 
document under paragraph (c) of this section and a proper fee under 
paragraph (d) of this section are all received in the Copyright Office. 
After recordation the document is returned to the sender with a 
certificate of record.

Sec. 201.5  Corrections and amplifications of copyright registrations; applications for supplementary registration.

    (a) General. (1) This section prescribes conditions relating to the 
filing of an application for supplementary registration, to correct an 
error in a copyright registration or to amplify the information given in 
a registration, under section 408(d) of title 17 of the United States 
Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553. For the purposes of this section:
    (i) A basic registration means any of the following:
    (A) A copyright registration made under sections 408, 409, and 410 
of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553;
    (B) A renewal registration made under section 304 of title 17 of the 
United States Code, as so amended;
    (C) A registration of claim to copyright made under title 17 of the 
United States Code as it existed before January 1, 1978; or
    (D) A renewal registration made under title 17 of the United States 
Code as it existed before January 1, 1978; and
    (ii) A supplementary registration means a registration made upon 
application under section 408(d) of title 17 of the United States Code, 
as amended by Pub. L. 94-553, and the provisions of this section.
    (2) No correction or amplification of the information in a basic 
registration will be made except pursuant to the provisions of this 
Sec. 201.5. As an exception, where it is discovered that the record of a 
basic registration contains an error that the Copyright Office itself 
should have recognized at the time registration was made, the Office 
will take appropriate measures to rectify its error.
    (b) Persons entitled to file an application for supplementary 
registration; grounds of application. (1) Supplementary registration can 
be made only if a basic copyright registration for the same work has 
already been completed. After a basic registration has been completed, 
any author or other copyright claimant of the work, or the owner of any 
exclusive right in the work, or the duly authorized agent of any such 
author, other claimant, or owner, who wishes to correct or amplify the 
information given in the basic registration for the work may file an 
application for supplementary registration.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ If the person who, or on whose behalf, an application for 
supplementary registration is submitted is the same as the person 
identified as the copyright claimant in the basic registration, the 
Copyright Office will place a note referring to the supplementary 
registration on its records of the basic registration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Supplementary registration may be made either to correct or to 
amplify the information in a basic registration. For the purposes of 
this section:
    (i) A correction is appropriate if information in the basic 
registration was incorrect at the time that basic registration was made, 
and the error is not one that the Copyright Office itself should have 
recognized;
    (ii) An amplification is appropriate:
    (A) To supplement or clarify the information that was required by 
the application for the basic registration and should have been 
provided, such as the identity of a co-author or co-claimant, but was 
omitted at the time the basic registration was made, or
    (B) To reflect changes in facts, other than those relating to 
transfer, license, or ownership of rights in the work, that have 
occurred since the basic registration was made.
    (iii) Supplementary registration is not appropriate:
    (A) As an amplification, to reflect a change in ownership that 
occurred on or after the effective date of the basic registration or to 
reflect the division, allocation, licensing or transfer of rights in a 
work; or

[[Page 423]]

    (B) To correct errors in statements or notices on the copies of 
phonorecords of a work, or to reflect changes in the content of a work; 
and
    (iv) Where a basic renewal registration has been made for a work 
during the last year of the relevant first-term copyright, supplementary 
registration to correct the renewal claimant or basis of claim or to add 
a renewal claimant is ordinarily possible only if the application for 
supplementary registration and fee are received in the Copyright Office 
within the last year of the relevant first-term copyright. If the error 
or omission in a basic renewal registration is extremely minor, and does 
not involve the identity of the renewal claimant or the legal basis of 
the claim, supplementary registration may be made at any time. In an 
exceptional case, however, supplementary registration may be made to 
correct the name of the renewal claimant and the legal basis of the 
claim at any time if clear, convincing, objective documentation is 
submitted to the Copyright Office which proves that an inadvertent error 
was made in failing to designate the correct living statutory renewal 
claimant in the basic renewal registration.
    (c) Form and content of application for supplementary registration. 
(1) An application for supplementary registration shall be made on a 
form prescribed by the Copyright Office, shall be accompanied by the 
appropriate fee identified in Sec. 201.3(c) and shall contain the 
following information:
    (i) The title of the work as it appears in the basic registration, 
including previous or alternative titles if they appear;
    (ii) The registration number of the basic registration;
    (iii) The year when the basic registration was completed;
    (iv) The name or names of the author or authors of the work, and the 
copyright claimant or claimants in the work, as they appear in the basic 
registration;
    (v) In the case of a correction:
    (A) The line number and heading or description of the part of the 
basic registration where the error occurred;
    (B) A transcription of the erroneous information as it appears in 
the basic registration;
    (C) A statement of the correct information as it should have 
appeared; and
    (D) If desired, an explanation of the error or its correction;
    (vi) In the case of an amplification:
    (A) The line number and heading or description of the part of the 
basic registration where the information to be amplified appears;
    (B) A clear and succinct statement of the information to be added; 
and
    (C) If desired, an explanation of the amplification;
    (vii) The name and address:
    (A) To which correspondence concerning the application should be 
sent; and
    (B) To which the certificate of supplementary registration should be 
mailed; and
    (viii) The certification shall consist of:
    (A) The handwritten signature of the author, other copyright 
claimant, or owner of exclusive right(s) in the work, or of the duly 
authorized agent of such author, other claimant or owner (who shall also 
be identified);
    (B) The typed or printed name of the person whose signature appears, 
and the date of signature; and
    (C) A statement that the person signing the application is the 
author, other copyright claimant, or owner of exclusive right(s) in the 
work, or the authorized agent of such author, other claimant, or owner, 
and that the statements made in the application are correct to the best 
of that person's knowledge.
    (2) The form prescribed by the Copyright Office for the foregoing 
purposes is designated ``Application for Supplementary Copyright 
Registration (Form CA)''. Copies of the form are available free upon 
request to the Public Information Office, Library of Congress, Copyright 
Office, 101 Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC 20559-6000.
    (3) Copies, phonorecords or supporting documents cannot be made part 
of the record of a supplementary registration and should not be 
submitted with the application.
    (d) Effect of supplementary registration. (1) When a supplementary 
registration is completed, the Copyright Office will

[[Page 424]]

assign it a new registration number in the appropriate class, and issue 
a certificate of supplementary registration under that number.
    (2) As provided in section 408(d) of title 17, the information 
contained in a supplementary registration augments but does not 
supersede that contained in the basic registration. The basic 
registration will not be expunged or cancelled.

Sec. 201.6  Payment and refund of Copyright Office fees.

    (a) In general. All fees sent to the Copyright Office should be in 
the form of a money order, check or bank draft payable to the Register 
of Copyrights. Coin or currency sent to the Office in letters or 
packages will be at the remitter's risk. Remittances from foreign 
countries should be in the form of an International Money Order or Bank 
Draft payable and immediately negotiable in the United States for the 
full amount of the fee required. Uncertified checks are accepted subject 
to collection. Where the statutory fee is submitted in the form of a 
check, the registration of the copyright claim or other record made by 
the Office is provisional until payment in money is received. In the 
event the fee is not paid, the registration or other record shall be 
expunged.
    (b) Deposit accounts. Persons or firms having a considerable amount 
of business with the Copyright Office may, for their own convenience, 
prepay copyright expenses by establishing a Deposit Account.
    (c) Refunds. Money remitted to the Copyright Office for original, 
basic, supplementary or renewal registration will not be refunded if the 
claim is rejected because the material deposited does not constitute 
copyrightable subject matter or because the claim is invalid for any 
other reason. Payments made by mistake or in excess of the statutory fee 
will be refunded, but amounts of $50 or less will not be refunded unless 
specifically requested, and refunds of less than $2 may be made in 
postage stamps. Before making any refund for fees remitted in relation 
to nonregistration copyright services, the Copyright Office shall deduct 
an administrative processing fee in an amount equivalent to one hour of 
the requested service, or the minimum fee set by statute for the 
service.
    (d) Return of deposit copies. Copies of works deposited in the 
Copyright Office pursuant to law are either retained in the Copyright 
Office, transferred for the permanent collections or other uses of the 
Library of Congress, or disposed of according to law. When an 
application is rejected, the Copyright Office reserves the right to 
retain the deposited copies.

Sec. 201.7  Cancellation of completed registrations.

    (a) Definition. Cancellation is an action taken by the Copyright 
Office whereby either the registration is eliminated on the ground that 
the registration is invalid under the applicable law and regulations, or 
the registration number is eliminated and a new registration is made 
under a different class and number.
    (b) General policy. The Copyright Office will cancel a completed 
registration only in those cases where:
    (1) It is clear that no registration should have been made because 
the work does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or fails to 
satisfy the other legal and formal requirements for obtaining copyright;
    (2) Registration may be authorized but the application, deposit 
material, or fee does not meet the requirements of the law and Copyright 
Office regulations, and the Office is unable to get the defect 
corrected; or
    (3) An existing registration in the wrong class is to be replaced by 
a new registration in the correct class.
    (c) Circumstances under which a registration will be cancelled. (1) 
Where the Copyright Office becomes aware after

[[Page 425]]

registration that a work is not copyrightable, either because the 
authorship is de minimis or the work does not contain authorship subject 
to copyright, the registration will be cancelled. The copyright claimant 
will be notified by correspondence of the proposed cancellation and the 
reasons therefor, and be given 30 days, from the date the Copyright 
Office letter is mailed, to show cause in writing why the cancellation 
should not be made. If the claimant fails to respond within the 30 day 
period, or if the Office after considering the response, determines that 
the registration was made in error and not in accordance with title 17 
U.S.C., Chapters 1 through 8, the registration will be cancelled.
    (2) When a check received in payment of a registration fee is 
returned to the Copyright Office marked ``insufficient funds'' or is 
otherwise uncollectible the Copyright Office will immediately cancel any 
registration(s) for which the dishonored check was submitted and will 
notify the remitter the registration has been cancelled because the 
check was returned as uncollectible.
    (3) Where registration is made in the wrong class, the Copyright 
Office will cancel the first registration, replace it with a new 
registration in the correct class, and issue a corrected certificate.
    (4) Where registration has been made for a work which appears to be 
copyrightable but after registration the Copyright Office becomes aware 
that, on the administrative record before the Office, the statutory 
requirements have apparently not been satisfied, or that information 
essential to registration has been omitted entirely from the application 
or is questionable, or correct deposit material has not been deposited, 
the Office will correspond with the copyright claimant in an attempt to 
secure the required information or deposit material or to clarify the 
information previously given on the application. If the Copyright Office 
receives no reply to its correspondence within 30 days of the date the 
letter is mailed, or the response does not resolve the substantive 
defect, the registration will be cancelled. The correspondence will 
include the reason for the cancellation. The following are instances 
where a completed registration will be cancelled unless the substantive 
defect in the registration can be cured:
    (i) Eligibility for registration has not been established;
    (ii) A work published before March 1, 1989, was registered more than 
5 years after the date of first publication and the deposit copy or 
phonorecord does not contain a statutory copyright notice;
    (iii) The deposit copies or phonorecords of a work published before 
January 1, 1978 do not contain a copyright notice or the notice is 
defective;
    (iv) A renewal claim was registered after the statutory time limits 
for registration had apparently expired;
    (v) The application and copy(s) or phonorecord(s) do not match each 
other and the Office cannot locate a copy or phonorecord as described in 
the application elsewhere in the Copyright Office or the Library of 
Congress;
    (vi) The application for registration does not identify a copyright 
claimant or it appears from the transfer statement on the application or 
elsewhere that the ``claimant'' named in the application does not have 
the right to claim copyright;
    (vii) A claim to copyright is based on material added to a 
preexisting work and a reading of the application in its totality 
indicates that there is no copyrightable new material on which to base a 
claim;
    (viii) A work subject to the manufacturing provisions of the Act of 
1909 was apparently published in violation of those provisions;
    (ix) For a work published after January 1, 1978, the only claimant 
given on the application was deceased on the date the application was 
certified;
    (x) A work is not anonymous or pseudonymous and statements on the 
application and/or copy vary so much that the author cannot be 
identified; and
    (xi) Statements on the application conflict or are so unclear that 
the claimant cannot be adequately identified.
    (d) Minor substantive errors. Where a registration includes minor 
substantive errors or omissions which would generally have been 
rectified before registration, the Copyright Office will attempt to 
rectify the error

[[Page 426]]

through correspondence with the remitter. Except in those cases 
enumerated in paragraph (c) of this section, if the Office is unable for 
any reason to obtain the correct information or deposit copy, the 
registration record will be annotated to state the nature of the 
informality and show that the Copyright Office attempted to correct the 
registration.

Sec. 201.8  Disruption of postal or other transportation or communication services.

    (a) For purposes of 17 U.S.C. 709, when the Register has determined 
that there is or has been a general disruption or suspension of postal 
or other transportation or communications services that has delayed the 
receipt by the Copyright Office of deposits, applications, fees, or any 
other materials, the Register shall publish an announcement of that 
determination, stating the date on which the disruption or suspension 
commenced. The announcement may, if appropriate, limit the means of 
delivery that are subject to relief pursuant to section 709. Following 
the cessation of the disruption or suspension of services, the Register 
shall publish an announcement stating the date on which the disruption 
or suspension has terminated.
    (b) At the request of any person who provides satisfactory evidence 
that he or she has attempted to deliver a deposit, application, fee or 
other material to the Copyright Office but that receipt by the Copyright 
Office was delayed due to a general disruption or suspension of postal 
or other transportation or communications services, the Register shall 
assign, as the date of receipt of the deposit, application, fee or other 
material, the date on which the Register determines the material would 
have been received but for the disruption or suspension of services, if 
the deposit, application, fee or other material was actually received in 
the Copyright Office within one month after the disruption or suspension 
of services has terminated.
    (c) Timing. The request shall be made:
    (1) With respect to an application for copyright registration, no 
earlier than the date on which the claimant receives the certificate of 
registration and no later than one year after the date on which the 
claimant receives the certificate of registration; provided, however, 
that a request may be made prior to receipt of a certificate of 
registration--
    (i) If the Copyright Office has communicated with the claimant 
relating to the application and the claimant makes the request as part 
of a response to the communication from the Office; or
    (ii) If the Register determines that good cause exists to entertain 
a request prior to the issuance of a certificate of registration;
    (2) With respect to a transfer of copyright ownership or other 
document submitted for recordation pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 205, no later 
than one year after the date on which the person submitting the transfer 
or document receives the certificate of recordation;
    (3) With respect to any other material, no later than one year after 
the date on which the material was actually received in the Copyright 
Office.
    (d) In cases in which a certificate or registration or a certificate 
of recordation has already been issued, the original certificate must be 
returned to the Copyright Office along with the request.
    (e) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, satisfactory 
evidence shall consist of:
    (1) A receipt from the United States Postal Service indicating the 
date on which the United States Postal Service received material for 
delivery to the Copyright Office by means of first class mail, Priority 
Mail or Express Mail;
    (2) A receipt from a delivery service such as, or comparable to, 
United Parcel Service, Federal Express, or Airborne Express, indicating 
the date on which the delivery service received material for delivery to 
the Copyright Office and
    (i) The date on which delivery was to be made to the Copyright 
Office, or
    (ii) The period of time (e.g., overnight, or 2 days) from receipt by 
the delivery service to the date on which

[[Page 427]]

delivery was to be made to the Copyright Office;
    (3) Other documentary evidence which the Register deems equivalent 
to the evidence set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section; 
or
    (4) A sworn statement from a person with actual knowledge of the 
facts relating to the attempt to deliver the material to the Copyright 
Office, setting forth with particularity facts which satisfy the 
Register that in the absence of the general disruption or suspension of 
postal or other transportation or communications services, the material 
would have been received by the Copyright Office by a particular date.
    (f) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the Register 
shall presume that but for the general disruption or suspension of 
postal or other transportation or communications services,
    (1) Materials deposited with the United States Postal Service for 
delivery by means of first class mail would have been received in the 
Copyright Office seven days after deposit with the United States Postal 
Service;
    (2) Materials deposited with the United States Postal Service for 
delivery by means of Priority mail would have been received in the 
Copyright Office three days after deposit with the United States Postal 
Service;
    (3) Materials deposited with the United States Postal Service for 
delivery by means of Express mail would have been received in the 
Copyright Office one day after deposit with the United States Postal 
Service;
    (4) Materials deposited with a delivery service such as, or 
comparable to, United Parcel Service, Federal Express, or Airborne 
Express, would have been received in the Copyright Office on the date 
indicated on the receipt from the delivery service.
    (g) Requests pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be 
addressed to: Chief, Copyright Office Receiving & Processing Division, 
Copyright Office, and if delivered by hand they should be brought to the 
Copyright Office Public Information Office, Library of Congress, James 
Madison Memorial Building, Room 401, First and Independence Avenue, SE., 
Washington, DC. If mailed, the request should be addressed to Chief, 
Receiving & Processing Division, P.O. Box 71380, Washington, DC 20024-

notice who constitute more than one-half of that author's termination 
interest: That author's surviving widow or widower; and all of that 
author's surviving children; and, where any of that author's children 
are dead, all of the surviving children of any such deceased child of 
that author; however, instead of the information required by this 
paragraph (v), the notice may contain both of the following:
    (A) A statement of as much of such information as is currently 
available to the person or persons signing the notice, with a brief 
explanation of the reasons why full information is or may be lacking; 
together with
    (B) A statement that, to the best knowledge and belief of the person 
or persons signing the notice, the notice has been signed by all persons 
whose signature is necessary to terminate the grant under section 304(c) 
of title 17, U.S.C., or by their duly authorized agents.
    (2) Clear identification of the information specified by paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section requires a complete and unambiguous statement of 
facts in the notice itself, without incorporation by reference of 
information in other documents or records.
    (c) Signature. (1) In the case of a termination of a grant executed 
by a person or persons other than the author, the notice shall be signed 
by all of the surviving person or persons who executed the grant, or by 
their duly authorized agents.
    (2) In the case of a termination of a grant executed by one or more 
of the authors of the work, the notice as to any one author's share 
shall be signed by that author or by his or her duly authorized agent. 
If that author is dead, the notice shall be signed by the number and 
proportion of the owners of that author's termination interest required 
under clauses (1) and (2) of section 304(c) of title 17, U.S.C., or by 
their duly authorized agents, and shall contain a brief statement of 
their relationship or relationships to that author.
    (3) Where a signature is by a duly authorized agent, it shall 
clearly identify the person or persons on whose behalf the agent is 
acting.
    (4) The handwritten signature of each person effecting the 
termination shall either be accompanied by a statement of the full name 
and address of that person, typewritten or printed legibly by hand, or 
shall clearly correspond to such a statement elswhere in the notice.
    (d) Service. (1) The notice of termination shall be served upon each 
grantee whose rights are being terminated, or the grantee's successor in 
title, by

[[Page 429]]

personal service, or by first-class mail sent to an address which, after 
a reasonable investigation, is found to be the last known address of the 
grantee or successor in title.
    (2) The service provision of section 304(c)(4) of title 17, U.S.C., 
will be satisfied if, before the notice of termination is served, a 
reasonable investigation is made by the person or persons executing the 
notice as to the current ownership of the rights being terminated, and 
based on such investigation:
    (i) If there is no reason to believe that such rights have been 
transferred by the grantee to a successor in title, the notice is served 
on the grantee; or
    (ii) If there is reason to believe that such rights have been 
transferred by the grantee to a particular successor in title, the 
notice is served on such successor in title.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a reasonable 
investigation includes, but is not limited to, a search of the records 
in the Copyright Office; in the case of a musical composition with 
respect to which performing rights are licensed by a performing rights 
society, a ``reasonable investigation'' also includes a report from that 
performing rights society identifying the person or persons claiming 
current ownership of the rights being terminated.
    (4) Compliance with the provisions of clauses (2) and (3) of this 
paragraph (d) will satisfy the service requirements of section 304(c)(4) 
of title 17, U.S.C. However, as long as the statutory requirements, have 
been met, the failure to comply with the regulatory provisions of 
paragraphs (d) (2) or (3) of this section will not affect the validity 
of the service.
    (e) Harmless errors. (1) Harmless errors in a notice that do not 
materially affect the adequacy of the information required to serve the 
purposes of section 304(c) of title 17, U.S.C., shall not render the 
notice invalid.
    (2) Without prejudice to the general rule provided by paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section (e), errors made in giving the date or 
registration number referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, 
or in complying with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this 
section, or in describing the precise relationships under clause (2) of 
paragraph (c) of this section, shall not affect the validity of the 
notice if the errors were made in good faith and without any intention 
to deceive, mislead, or conceal relevant information.
    (f) Recordation. (1) A copy of the notice of termination will be 
recorded in the Copyright Office upon payment of the fee prescribed by 
paragraph (2) of this paragraph (f) and upon compliance with the 
following provisions:
    (i) The copy submitted for recordation shall be a complete and exact 
duplicate of the notice of termination as served and shall include the 
actual signature or signatures, or a reproduction of the actual 
signature or signatures, appearing on the notice; where separate copies 
of the same notice were served on more than one grantee or successor in 
title, only one copy need be submitted for recordation; and
    (ii) The copy submitted for recordation shall be accompanied by a 
statement setting forth the date on which the notice was served and the 
manner of service, unless such information is contained in the notice.
    (2) The fee for recordation of a document is prescribed in 
Sec. 201.3(c).
    (3) The date of recordation is the date when all of the elements 
required for recordation, including the prescribed fee and, if required, 
the statement referred to in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, have 
been received in the Copyright Office. After recordation, the document, 
including any accompanying statement, is returned to the sender with a 
certificate of record.
    (4) Recordation of a notice of termination by the Copyright Office 
is without prejudice to any party claiming that the legal and formal 
requirements for issuing a valid notice have not been met.

Sec. 201.11  Satellite carrier statements of account covering statutory licenses for secondary transmissions for private home viewing.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the deposit 
of

[[Page 430]]

Statements of Account and royalty fees in the Copyright Office as 
required by the satellite carrier license of section 119(b)(1) of title 
17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 103-369, in order 
that certain secondary transmissions by satellite carriers for private 
home viewing be subject to statutory licensing.
    (b) Definitions. (1) The terms distributor, network station, private 
home viewing, satellite carrier, subscriber, superstation, and unserved 
household have the meanings set forth in section 119(d) of title 17 of 
the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 103-369.
    (2) The terms primary transmission and secondary transmission have 
the meanings set forth in section 111(f) of title 17 of the United 
States Code.
    (c) Accounting periods and deposit. (1) Statements of Account shall 
cover semiannual accounting periods of January 1 through June 30, and 
July 1 through December 31, and shall be deposited in the Copyright 
Office, together with the total statutory royalty fee or the confirmed 
arbitration royalty fee for such accounting periods as prescribed by 
section 119(b)(1)(B) and (c)(3) of title 17, by not later than July 30, 
if the Statement of Account covers the January 1 through June 30 
accounting period, and by not later than the immediately following 
January 30, if the Statement of Account covers the July 1 through 
December 31 accounting period.
    (2) Upon receiving a Statement of Account and royalty fee, the 
Copyright Office will make an official record of the actual date when 
such statement and fee were physically received in the Copyright Office. 
Thereafter, the Licensing Division of the Copyright Office will examine 
the statement and fee for obvious errors or omissions appearing on the 
face of the documents, and will require that any such obvious errors or 
omissions be corrected before final processing of the documents is 
completed. If, as the result of communications between the Copyright 
Office and the satellite carrier, an additional fee is deposited or 
changes or additions are made in the Statement of Account, the date that 
additional deposit or information was actually received in the Office 
will be added to the official record of the case. However, completion by 
the Copyright Office of the final processing of a Statement of Account 
and royalty fee deposit shall establish only the fact of such completion 
and the date or dates of receipt shown in the official record. It shall 
in no case be considered a determination that the Statement of Account 
was, in fact, properly prepared and accurate, that the correct amount of 
the royalty fee had been deposited, that the statutory time limits for 
filing had been met, or that any other requirements to qualify for a 
statutory license have been satisfied.
    (3) Statements of Account and royalty fees received before the end 
of the particular accounting period they purport to cover will not be 
processed by the Copyright Office. Statements of Account and royalty 
fees received after the filing deadlines of July 30 or January 30, 
respectively, will be accepted for whatever legal effect they may have, 
if any.
    (4) In the Register's discretion, four years after the close of any 
calendar year, the Register may close out the royalty payments account 
for that calendar year, and may treat any funds remaining in such 
account and any subsequent deposits that would otherwise be attributable 
to that calendar year as attributable to the succeeding calendar year.
    (d) Forms. (1) Each Statement of Account shall be furnished on an 
appropriate form prescribed by the Copyright Office, and shall contain 
the information required by that form and its accompanying instructions. 
Computation of the copyright royalty fee shall be in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in the forms. Copies of Statement of Account forms 
are available free upon request to the Library of Congress, Copyright 
Office, Licensing Division, 101 Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC 
20557-6400.
    (2) The form prescribed by the Copyright Office is designated

true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, 
and belief, and are made in good faith.

    (f) Royalty fee payment. All royalty fees may be paid by electronic 
transfer of funds, provided the payment is received in the designated 
United States Federal Reserve Bank by the filing deadline for the 
relevant accounting period. Except in the case of an electronic payment, 
the royalty fee payable for the period covered by the Statement of 
Account shall accompany that Statement of Account and shall be deposited 
at the Copyright Office with it. Payment must be in the form of a 
certified check, cashier's check, or a

[[Page 432]]

money order, payable to: Register of Copyrights; or a United States 
Treasury electronic payment.
    (g) Corrections, supplemental payments, and refunds. (1) Upon 
compliance with the procedures and within the time limits set forth in 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section, corrections to Statements of Account 
will be placed on record, supplemental royalty fee payments will be 
received for deposit, or refunds will be issued, in the following cases:
    (i) Where, with respect to the accounting period covered by a 
Statement of Account, any of the information given in the Statement 
filed in the Copyright Office is incorrect or incomplete; or
    (ii) Where calculation of the royalty fee payable for a particular 
accounting period was incorrect, and the amount deposited in the 
Copyright Office for that period was either too high or too low.
    (2) Corrections to Statements of Account will not be placed on 
record, supplemental royalty fee payments will not be received for 
deposit, and refunds will not be issued, where the information in the 
Statements of Account, the royalty fee calculations, or the payments 
were correct as of the date on which the accounting period ended, but 
changes (for example, addition or deletion of a signal) took place 
later.
    (3) Requests that corrections to a Statement of Account be placed on 
record, that fee payments be accepted, or requests for the issuance of 
refunds, shall be made only in the cases mentioned in paragraph (g)(1) 
of this section. Such requests shall be addressed to the Licensing 
Division of the Copyright Office, and shall meet the following 
conditions:
    (i) The request must be in writing, must clearly identify its 
purpose, and, in the case of a request for a refund, must be received in 
the Copyright Office before the expiration of 30 days from the last day 
of the applicable Statement of Account filing period, or before the 
expiration of 30 days from the date of receipt at the Copyright Office 
of the royalty payment that is the subject of the request, whichever 
time period is longer. A telegraphic or similar unsigned communication 
will be considered to meet this requirement if it clearly identifies the 
basis of the request, if it is received in the Copyright Office within 
the required 30-day period, and if a written request meeting all the 
conditions of this paragraph (g)(3) is also received in the Copyright 
Office within 14 days after the end of such 30-day period:
    (ii) The Statement of Account to which the request pertains must be 
sufficiently identified in the request (by inclusion of the name of the 
owner of the satellite carrier and the accounting period in question) so 
that it can be readily located in the records of the Copyright Office;
    (iii) The request must contain a clear statement of the facts on 
which it is based and provide a clear basis on which a refund may be 
granted, in accordance with the following procedures:
    (A) In the case of a request filed under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this 
section, where the information given in the Statement of Account is 
incorrect or incomplete, the request must clearly identify the erroneous 
or incomplete information and provide the correct or additional 
information:
    (B) In the case of a request filed under paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of 
this section, where the royalty fee was miscalculated and the amount 
deposited in the Copyright Office was either too high or too low, the 
request must be accompanied by an affidavit under the official seal of 
any officer authorized to administer oaths within the United States, or 
a statement in accordance with section 1746 of title 28 of the United 
States Code, made and signed in accordance with paragraph (e)(9) of this 
section. The affidavit or statement shall describe the reasons why the 
royalty fee was improperly calculated and include a detailed analysis of 
the proper royalty calculation.
    (iv)(A) All requests filed under this paragraph (g) must be 
accompanied by a filing fee in the amount of $15 for each Statement of 
Account involved. Payment of this fee may be in the form of a personal 
or company check, or of a certified check, cashier's check or money 
order, payable to: Register of Copyrights. No request will be processed 
until the appropriate filing fees are received.

[[Page 433]]

    (B) All requests that a supplemental royalty fee payment be received 
for deposit under this paragraph (g) must be accompanied by a remittance 
in the full amount of such fee. Payment of the supplemental royalty fee 
must be in the form of certified check, cashier's check, or money order, 
payable to: Register of Copyrights; or electronic payment. No such 
request will be processed until an acceptable remittance in the full 
amount of the supplemental royalty fee has been received.
    (v) All requests submitted under this paragraph (g) must be signed 
by the satellite carrier owner named in the Statement of Account, or the 
duly authorized agent of the owner, in accordance with paragraph (e)(9) 
of this section.
    (vi) A request for a refund is not necessary where the Licensing 
Division, during its examination of a Statement of Account or related 
document, discovers an error that has resulted in a royalty overpayment. 
In this case, the Licensing Division will forward the royalty refund to 
the satellite carrier owner named in the Statement of Account without 
regard to the time limitations provided for in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of 
this section.
    (4) Following final processing, all requests submitted under this 
paragraph (g) will be filed with the original Statement of Account in 
the records of the Copyright Office. Nothing contained in this paragraph 
shall be considered to relieve satellite carriers from their full 
obligations under title 17 of the United States Code, and the filing of 
a correction or supplemental payment shall have only such effect as may 
be attributed to it by a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (h) Interest. (1) Royalty fee payments submitted as a result of late 
or amended filings will include interest. Interest will begin to accrue 
beginning on the first day after the close of the period for filing 
statements of account for all underpayments or late payments of 
royalties for the satellite carrier statutory license for secondary 
transmissions for private home viewing occurring within that accounting 
period. The accrual period will end on the date appearing on the 
certified check, cashier's check, money order, or electronic payment 
submitted by a satellite carrier, provided that such payment is received 
by the Copyright Office within five business days of that date. If the 
payment is not received by the Copyright Office within five business 
days of its date, the accrual period will end on the date of actual 
receipt by the Copyright Office.
    (2)(i) The interest rate applicable to a specific accounting period 
beginning with the 1992/2 period shall be the Current Value of Funds 
Rate, as established by section 8025.40 of the Treasury Financial Manual 
and published in the Federal Register, in effect on the first business 
day after the close of the filing deadline for that accounting period. 
Satellite carriers wishing to obtain the interest rate for a specific 
accounting period may do so by consulting the Federal Register for the 
applicable Current Value of Funds Rate, or by contacting the Licensing 
Division of the Copyright Office.
    (ii) The interest rate applicable to a specific accounting period 
earlier than the 1992/2 period shall be the rate fixed by the Licensing 
Division of the Copyright Office pursuant to 37 CFR 201.11(h) in effect 
on June 30, 1992.
    (3) Interest is not required to be paid on any royalty underpayment 
or late payment from a particular accounting period if the interest 
charge is less than or equal to five dollars ($5.00).

Sec. 201.13  Notices of objection to certain noncommercial performances of nondramatic literary or musical works.

    (a) Definitions. (1) A Notice of Objection is a notice, as required 
by section 110(4) of title 17 of the United States Code as amended by 
Pub. L. 94-553, to be served as a condition of preventing the 
noncommercial performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work 
under certain circumstances.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the copyright owner of a 
nondramatic literary or musical work is the author of the work 
(including, in the case of a work made for hire, the employer or other 
person for whom the work was prepared), or a person or organization that 
has obtained ownership of the exclusive right, initially owned by the 
author of performance of the type referred to in 17 U.S.C. 110(4). If 
the other requirements of this section are met, a Notice of Objection 
may cover the works of more than one copyright owner.
    (b) Form. The Copyright Office does not provide printed forms for 
the use of persons serving Notices of Objection.
    (c) Contents. (1) A Notice of Objection must clearly state that the 
copyright owner objects to the performance, and must include all of the 
following:
    (i) Reference to the statutory authority on which the Notice of 
Objection is based, either by citation of 17 U.S.C. 110(4) or by a more 
general characterization or description of that statutory provision;
    (ii) The date and place of the performance to which an objection is 
being made; however, if the exact date or place of a particular 
performance, or both, are not known to the copyright owner, it is 
sufficient if the Notice describes whatever information the copyright 
owner has about the date and place of a particular performance, and the 
source of that information unless the source was considered private or 
confidential;
    (iii) Clear identification, by title and at least one author, of the 
particular nondramatic literary or musical work or works, to the 
performance of which the copyright owner thereof is lodging objection; a 
Notice may cover any number of separately identified copyrighted works 
owned by the copyright owner or owners serving the objection. 
Alternatively, a blanket notice, with or without separate identification 
of certain copyrighted works, and purporting to cover one or more groups 
of copyrighted works not separately identified by title and author, 
shall have effect if the conditions specified in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section are met; and
    (iv) A concise statement of the reasons for the objection.
    (2) A blanket notice purporting to cover one or more groups of 
copyrighted works not separately identified by title and author shall be 
valid only if all of the following conditions are met:
    (i) The Notice shall identify each group of works covered by the 
blanket notice by a description of any common

[[Page 435]]

characteristics distinguishing them from other copyrighted works, such 
as common author, common copyright owner, common publisher, or common 
licensing agent;
    (ii) The Notice shall identify a particular individual whom the 
person responsible for the performance can contact for more detailed 
information about the works covered by the blanket notice and to 
determine whether a particular work planned for performance is in fact 
covered by the Notice. Such identification shall include the full name 
and business and residence addresses of the individual, telephone 
numbers at which the individual can be reached throughout the period 
between service of the notice and the performance, and name, addresses, 
and telephone numbers of another individual to contact during that 
period in case the first cannot be reached.
    (iii) If the copyright owner or owners of all works covered by the 
blanket notice is not identified in the Notice, the Notice shall include 
an offer to identify, by name and last known address, the owner or 
owners of any and all such works, upon request made to the individual 
referred to in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (3) A Notice of Objection must also include clear and prominent 
statements explaining that:
    (i) A failure to exclude the works identified in the Notice from the 
performance in question may subject the person responsible for the 
performance to liability for copyright infringement; and
    (ii) The objection is without legal effect if there is no direct or 
indirect admission charge for the performance, and if the other

Secs. 201.15-201.16  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 201.17  Statements of Account covering compulsory licenses for secondary transmissions by cable systems.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the deposit 
of Statements of Account and royalty fees in the Coypright Office as 
required by section 111(d)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code in 
order for secondary transmissions of cable systems to be subject to 
compulsory licensing.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Gross receipts for the ``basic service of 
providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters'' 
include the full amount of monthly (or other periodic) service fees for 
any and all services or tiers of services which include one or more 
secondary transmissions of television or radio broadcast signals, for 
additional set fees, and for converter fees. In no case shall gross 
receipts be less than the cost of obtaining the signals of primary 
broadcast transmitters for subsequent retransmission. All such gross 
receipts shall be aggregated and the distant signal equivalent (DSE) 
calculations shall be made against the aggregated amount. Gross receipts 
for secondary transmission services do not include installation 
(including connection, relocation, disconnection, or reconnection) fees, 
separate charges for security, alarm or facsimile services, charges for 
late payments, or charges for pay cable or other program origination 
services: Provided That, the origination services are not offered in 
combination with secondary transmission service for a single fee.
    (2) A cable system is a facility, located in any State, Territory, 
Trust Territory, or Possession, that in whole or in part receives 
signals transmitted or programs broadcast by one or more television 
broadcast stations licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, 
and makes secondary transmissions of such signals or programs by wires, 
cables, microwave, or other communications channels to subscribing 
members of the public who pay for such service. A system that meets this 
definition is considered a ``cable system'' for copyright purposes, even 
if

[[Page 437]]

the FCC excludes it from being considered a ``cable system'' because of 
the number or nature of its subscribers or the nature of its secondary 
transmissions. The Statements of Account and royalty fees to be 
deposited under Sec. 201.17 of this section, shall be recorded and 
deposited by each individual cable system desiring its secondary 
transmissions to be subject to compulsory licensing. The owner of each 
individual cable system on the last day of the accounting period covered 
by a Statement of Account is responsible for depositing the Statement of 
Account and remitting the copyright royalty fees. For these purposes, 
and the purpose of Sec. 201.17 of this section, an ``individual'' cable 
system is each cable system recognized as a distinct entity under the 
rules, regulations, and practices of the Federal Communications 
Commission in effect on the last day of the accounting period covered by 
a Statement of Account, in the case of the preparation and deposit of a 
Statement of Account and copyright royalty fee. For these purposes, two 
or more cable facilities are considered as one individual cable system 
if the facilities are either:
    (i) In contiguous communities under common ownership or control or
    (ii) Operating from one headend.
    (3) FCC means the Federal Communications Commission.
    (4) In the case of cable systems which make secondary transmissions 
of all available FM radio signals, which signals are not electronically 
processed by the system as separate and discrete signals, an FM radio 
signal is ``generally receivable'' if:
    (i) It is usually carried by the system whenever it is received at 
the system's headend, and
    (ii) As a result of monitoring at reasonable times and intervals, it 
can be expected to be received at the system's headend, with the 
system's FM antenna, at least three consecutive hours each day at the 
same time each day, five or more days a week, for four or more weeks 
during any calendar quarter, with a strength of not less than fifty 
microvolts per meter measured at the foot of the tower or pole to which 
the antenna is attached.
    (5) The terms primary transmission, secondary transmission, local 
service area of a primary transmitter, distant signal equivalent, 
network station, independent station, and noncommercial educational 
station have the meanings set forth in section 111(f) of title 17 of the 
United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553 and Pub. L. 103-369.
    (6) A primary transmitter is a ``distant'' station, for purposes of 
this section, if the programming of such transmitter is carried by the 
cable system in whole or in part beyond the local service area of such 
primary transmitter.
    (7) A translator station is, with respect to programs both 
originally transmitted and retransmitted by it, a primary transmitter 
for the purposes of this section. A translator station which retransmits 
the programs of a network station will be considered a network station; 
a translator station which retransmits the programs of an independent 
station shall be considered an independent station; and a translator 
station which retransmits the programs of a noncommercial educational 
station shall be considered a noncommercial educational station. The 
determination of whether a translator station should be identified as a 
``distant'' station depends on the local service area of the translator 
station.
    (8) For purposes of this section, the ``rules and regulations of the 
FCC in effect on October 19, 1976,'' which permitted a cable system, at 
its election, to omit the retransmission of a particular program and 
substitute another program in its place, refers to that portion of 
former 47 CFR 76.61(b)(2), revised June 25, 1981, and Sec. 76.63 
(referring to Sec. 76.61(b)(2)), deleted June 25, 1981, concerning the 
substitution of a program that is primarily of local interest to the 
distant community (e.g., a local news or public affairs program).
    (9) For purposes of this section, the ``rules and regulations of the 
FCC'', which require a cable system to omit the retransmission of a 
particular program and substitute another program in its place, refers 
to 47 CFR 76.67.
    (10) For purposes of this section, a cable system ``lacks the 
activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis all 
signals which it is authorized to carry'' only if:
    (i) All of its activated television channels are used exclusively 
for the

[[Page 438]]

secondary transmission of television signals; and
    (ii) The number of primary television transmitters secondarily 
transmitted by the cable system exceeds the number of its activated 
television channels.
    (c) Accounting periods and deposit. (1) Statements of Account shall 
cover semiannual accounting periods of (i) January 1 through June 30, 
and (ii) July 1 through December 31, and shall be deposited in the 
Copyright Office, together with the total royalty fee for such 
accounting periods as prescribed by section 111(d)(1) (B), (C), or (D) 
of title 17, by not later than the immediately following August 29, if 
the Statement of Account covers the January 1 through June 30 accounting 
period, and by not later than the immediately following March 1, if the 
Statement of Account covers the July 1 through December 31 accounting 
period.
    (2) Upon receiving a Statement of Account and royalty fee, the 
Copyright Office will make an official record of the actual date when 
such Statement and fee were physically received in the Copyright Office. 
Thereafter, the Office will examine the Statement and fee for obvious 
errors or omissions appearing on the face of the documents, and will 
require that any such obvious errors or omissions be corrected before 
final processing of the documents is completed. If, as the result of 
communications between the Copyright Office and the cable system, an 
additional fee is deposited or changes or additions are made in the 
Statement of Account, the date that additional deposit or information 
was actually received in the Office will be added to the official record 
of the case. However, completion by the Copyright Office of the final 
processing of a Statement of Account and royalty fee deposit shall 
establish only the fact of such completion and the date or dates of 
receipt shown in the official record. It shall in no case be considered 
a determination that the Statement of Account was, in fact, properly 
prepared and accurate, that the correct amount of the royalty fee had 
been deposited, that the statutory time limits for filing had been met, 
or that any other requirements to qualify for a compulsory license have 
been satisfied.
    (3) Statements of Account and royalty fees received before the end 
of the particular accounting period they purport to cover will not be 
processed by the Copyright Office. Statements of Account and royalty 
fees received after the filing deadlines of August 29 or March 1, 
respectively, will be accepted for whatever legal effect they may have, 
if any.
    (4) In the Register's discretion, four years after the close of any 
calendar year, the Register may, close out the royalty payments account 
for that calendar year, and may treat any funds remaining in such 
account and any subsequent deposits that would otherwise be attributable 
to that calendar year as attributable to the succeeding calendar year.
    (d) Forms. (1) Each Statement of Account shall be furnished on an 
appropriate form prescribed by the Copyright Office, and shall contain 
the information required by that form and its accompanying instructions. 
Computation of distant signal equivalents and the copyright royalty fee 
shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in the forms. 
Copies of Statement of Account forms are available free upon request to 
the Library of Congress, Copyright Office, Licensing Division, 101 
Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC 20557-6400.
    (2) The forms prescribed by the Copyright Office are designated 
``Statement of Account for Secondary Transmissions By Cable Systems'':
    (i) Form SA1-2--``Short Form'' for use by cable systems whose 
semiannual gross receipts for secondary transmission total less than 
$379,600; and
    (ii) Form SA3--``Long Form'' for use by cable systems whose 
semiannual gross receipts for secondary transmission total $379,600 or 
more.
    (e) Contents. Each Statement of Account shall contain the following 
information:
    (1) A clear designation of the accounting period covered by the 
Statement.
    (2) The designation ``Owner,'' followed by:
    (i) The full legal name of the owner of the cable system. The owner 
of the

[[Page 439]]

cable system is the individual or entity that provides the 
retransmission service and collects payment from the end user either 
directly or indirectly through a third party. If the owner is a 
partnership, the name of the partnership is to be followed by the name 
of at least one individual partner;
    (ii) Any other name or names under which the owner conducts the 
business of the cable system; and
    (iii) The full mailing address of the owner.

Ownership, other names under which the owner conducts the business of 
the cable system, and the owner's mailing address shall reflect facts 
existing on the last day of the accounting period covered by the 
Statement of Account.
    (3) The designation ``System,'' followed by:
    (i) Any business or trade names used to identify the business and 
operation of the system, unless these names have already been given 
under the designation ``Owner''; and
    (ii) The full mailing address of the system, unless such address is 
the same as the address given under the designation ``Owner''.

Business or trade names used to identify the business and operation of 
the system, and the system's mailing address, shall reflect the facts 
existing on the last day of the accounting period covered by the 
Statement of Account.
    (4) The designation ``Area Served'', followed by the name of the 
community or communities served by the system. For this purpose a 
``community'' is the same as a ``community unit'' as defined in FCC 
rules and regulations.
    (5) The designation ``Channels,'' followed by:
    (i) The number of channels on which the cable system made secondary 
transmissions to its subscribers, and
    (ii) The cable system's total activated channel capacity, in each 
case during the period covered by the Statement.
    (6) The designation ``Secondary Transmission Service: Subscribers 
and Rates'', followed by:
    (i) A brief description of each subscriber category for which a 
charge is made by the cable system for the basic service of providing 
secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters;
    (ii) The number of subscribers to the cable system in each such 
subscriber category; and
    (iii) The charge or charges made per subscriber to each such 
subscriber category for the basic service of providing such secondary 
transmissions. Standard rate variations within a particular category 
should be summarized; discounts allowed for advance payment should not 
be included. For these purposes:
    (A) The description, the number of subscribers, and the charge or 
charges made shall reflect the facts existing on the last day of the 
period covered by the Statement; and
    (B) Each entity (for example, the owner of a private home, the 
resident of an apartment, the owner of a motel, or the owner of an 
apartment house) which is charged by the cable system for the basic 
service of providing secondary transmissions shall be considered one 
subscriber.
    (7) The designation ``Gross Receipts'', followed by the gross amount 
paid to the cable system by subscribers for the basic service of 
providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmissions 
during the period covered by the Statement of Account. If the cable 
system maintains its revenue accounts on an accrual basis, gross 
receipts for any accounting period includes all such amounts accrued for 
secondary transmission service furnished during that period, regardless 
of when accrued:
    (i) Less the amount of any bad debts actually written-off during 
that accounting period, excluding bad debts for secondary transmission 
service furnished before January 1, 1978;
    (ii) Plus the amount of any previously written-off bad debts for 
secondary transmission service which were actually recovered during that 
accounting period, excluding bad debt recoveries for secondary 
transmission service furnished before January 1, 1978.


If the cable system maintains its revenue accounts on a cash basis, 
gross receipts for any accounting period includes all such amounts 
actually received by the cable system during that

[[Page 440]]

accounting period, excluding amounts paid for secondary transmission 
service furnished before January 1, 1978; however, amounts received 
before January 1, 1978, for secondary transmission service furnished 
after that date, are to be considered as if they had been received 
during the accounting period in which the service covered by such 
payments was furnished.
    (8) The designation ``Services Other Than Secondary Transmissions: 
Rates,'' followed by a description of each package of service which 
consists solely of services other than secondary transmission services, 
for which a separate charge was made or established, and which the cable 
system furnished or made available to subscribers during the period 
covered by the Statement of Account, together with the amount of such 
charge. However, no information need be given concerning services 
furnished at cost. Specific amounts charged for pay cable programming 
need not be given if the rates are on a variable, per-program basis. 
(The fact of such variable charge shall be indicated.)
    (9) The designation ``Primary Transmitters: Television'', followed 
by an identification of all primary television transmitters whose 
signals were carried by the cable system during the period covered by 
the Statement of Account, other than primary transmitters of programs 
carried by the cable system exclusively pursuant to rules, regulations, 
or authorizations of the FCC in effect on October 19, 1976, permitting 
the substitution of signals under certain circumstances, and required to 
be specially identified by paragraph (e)(11) of this section, together 
with the information listed below:
    (i) The station call sign of the primary transmitter.
    (ii) The name of the community to which that primary transmitter is 
licensed by the FCC (in the case of domestic signals) or with which that 
primary transmitter is identified (in the case of foreign signals).
    (iii) The number of the channel upon which that primary transmitter 
broadcasts in the community to which that primary transmitter is 
licensed by the FCC (in the case of domestic signals) or with which that 
primary transmitter is identified (in the case of foreign signals).
    (iv) A designation as to whether that primary transmitter is a 
``network station'', an ``independent station'', or a ``noncommercial 
educational station''.
    (v) A designation as to whether that primary transmitter is a 
``distant'' station.
    (vi) If that primary transmitter is a ``distant'' station, a 
specification of whether the signals of that primary transmitter are 
carried:
    (A) On a part-time basis where full-time carriage is not possible 
because the cable system lacks the activated channel capacity to 
retransmit on a full-time basis all signals which it is authorized to 
carry; or
    (B) On any other basis.

If the signals of that primary transmitter are carried on a part-time 
basis because of lack of activated channel capacity, the Statement shall 
also include a log showing the dates on which such carriage occurred, 
and the hours during which such carriage occurred on those dates. Hours 
of carriage shall be accurate to the nearest quarter-hour, except that, 
in any case where such part-time carriage extends to the end of the 
broadcast day of the primary transmitter, an approximate ending hour may 
be given if it is indicated as an estimate.
    (vii) The information indicated by paragraph (e)(9), subclauses (v) 
and (vi) of this section, is not required to be given by any cable 
system that appropriately completed Form SA1-2 for the period covered by 
the Statement.
    (viii) Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, where a 
cable system carried a distant primary transmitter under FCC rules and 
regulations in effect on October 19, 1976 which permitted carriage of 
specific network programs on a part-time basis in certain circumstances 
(former 47 CFR 76.59 (d) (2) and (4), 76.61(e) (2) and (4), and 76.63, 
referring to Sec. 76.61(e) (2) and (4), all of which were deleted June 
25, 1981), carriage of that primary transmitter on that basis need not 
be reported, and that carriage is to be excluded in computing the 
distant signal equivalent of that primary transmitter.

[[Page 441]]

    (10) The designation ``Primary Transmitters: Radio'', followed by an 
identification of primary radio transmitters whose signals were carried 
by the cable system during the period covered by the Statement of 
Account, together with the information listed below:
    (i) A designation as to whether each primary transmitter was 
electronically processed by the system as a separate and discrete 
signal.
    (ii) The station call sign of each:
    (A) AM primary transmitter;
    (B) FM primary transmitter, the signals of which were electronically 
processed by the system as separate and discrete signals; and
    (C) FM primary transmitter carried on an all-band retransmission 
basis, the signals of which were generally receivable by the system.
    (iii) A designation as to whether the primary transmitter is AM or 
FM.
    (iv) The name of the community to which that primary transmitter is 
licensed by the FCC (in the case of domestic signals) or with which that 
primary transmitter is identified (in the case of foreign signals).
    (11) A special statement and program log, which shall consist of the 
information indicated below for all nonnetwork television programming 
that, during the period covered by the Statement, was carried in whole 
or in part beyond the local service area of the primary transmitter of 
such programming under (i) rules or regulations of the FCC requiring a 
cable system to omit the further transmission of a particular program 
and permitting the substitution of another program in place of the 
omitted transmission; or (ii) rules, regulations, or authorizations of 
the FCC in effect on October 19, 1976, permitting a cable system, at its 
election, to omit the further transmission of a particular program and 
permitting the substitution of another program in place of the omitted 
transmission:
    (A) The name or title of the substitute program.
    (B) Whether the substitute program was transmitted live by its 
primary transmitter.
    (C) The station call sign of the primary transmitter of the 
substitute program.
    (D) The name of the community to which the primary transmitter of 
the substitute program is licensed by the FCC (in the case of domestic 
signals) or with which that primary transmitter is identified (in the 
case of foreign signals).
    (E) The date when the secondary transmission of the substitute 
program occurred, and the hours during which such secondary transmission 
occurred on that date accurate to the nearest 5 minutes.
    (F) A designation as to whether deletion of the omitted program was 
permitted by the rules, regulations, or authorizations of the FCC in 
effect on October 19, 1976, or was required by the rules, regulations, 
or authorizations of the FCC.
    (12) A statement of the total royalty fee payable for the period 
covered by the Statement of Account, together with a royalty fee 
analysis which gives a clear, complete, and detailed presentation of the 
determination of such fee. This analysis shall present in appropriate 
sequence all facts, figures, and mathematical processes used in 
determining such fee, and shall do so in such manner as required in the 
appropriate form so as to permit the Copyright Office to verify readily, 
from the face of the Statement of Account, the accuracy of such 
determination and fee. The royalty fee analysis is not required to be 
given by any cable system whose gross receipts from subscribers for the 
period covered by the Statement of Account, for the basic service of 
providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmissions, 
total $98,600 or less.
    (13) The name, address, and telephone number of an individual who 
may be contacted by the Copyright Office for further information about 
the Statement of Account.
    (14) The handwritten signature of:
    (i) The owner of the cable system or a duly authorized agent of the 
owner, if the owner is not a partnership or a corporation; or
    (ii) A partner, if the owner is a partnership; or

The signature shall be accompanied by:

[[Page 442]]

    (A) The printed or typewritten name of the person signing the 
Statement of Account;
    (B) The date of signature;
    (C) If the owner of the cable system is a partnership or a 
corporation, by the title or official position held in the partnership 
or corporation by the person signing the Statement of Account;
    (D) A certification of the capacity of the person signing; and
    (E) A declaration of the veracity of the statements of fact 
contained in the Statement of Account and the good faith of the person 
signing in making such statement of fact.
    (f) Computation of distant signal equivalents. (1) A cable system 
that elects to delete a particular television program and substitute for 
that program another television program (``substitute program'') under 
rules, regulations, or authorizations of the FCC in effect on October 
19, 1976, which permit a cable system, at its election, to omit the 
retransmission of a particular program and substitute another program in 
its place shall compute the distant signal equivalent (``DSE'') of each 
primary transmitter that broadcasts one or more substitute programs by 
dividing:
    (i) The number of the primary transmitter's live, nonnetwork, 
substitute programs that were carried by the cable system, during the 
period covered by the Statement of Account, in substitution for programs 
deleted at the option of the system; by
    (ii) The number of days in the year in which the substitution 
occurred.
    (2)(i) Where a cable system carries a primary transmitter on a full-
time basis during any portion of an accounting period, the system shall 
compute a DSE for that primary transmitter as if it was carried full-
time during the entire accounting period.
    (ii) Where a cable system carries a primary transmitter solely on a 
substitute or part-time basis, in accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of 
this section, the system shall compute a DSE for that primary 
transmitter based on its cumulative carriage on a substitute or part-
time basis. If that primary transmitter is carried on a full-time basis 
as well as on a substitute or part-time basis, the full DSE for that 
primary transmitter shall be the full DSE type value for that primary 
transmitter, for the entire accounting period.
    (3)(i) In computing the DSE of a primary transmitter in a particular 
case of carriage before July 1, 1981, the cable system may make no 
prorated adjustments other than those specified as permissible 
``exceptions and limitations'' in the definition of ``distant signal 
equivalent'' in the fifth paragraph of section 111(f) of title 17 of the 
United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553. Four prorated 
adjustments, as prescribed in the fourth and fifth sentences of said 
definition, are permitted under certain conditions where:
    (A) A station is carried pursuant to the late-night programming 
rules of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on the date of 
carriage;
    (B) A station is carried pursuant to the specialty programming rules 
of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on the date of 
carriage;
    (C) A station is carried on a part-time basis where full-time 
carriage is not possible because the cable system lacks the activated 
channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis all signals which it 
is authorized to carry; and
    (D) A station is carried on a ``substitute'' basis under rules, 
regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission 
in effect on October 19, 1976.
    (ii) In computing the DSE of a primary transmitter in a particular 
case of carriage on or after July 1, 1981, the cable system may make no 
prorated adjustments other than those specified as permissible 
``exceptions and limitations'' in the definition of ``distant signal 
equivalent'' in the fifth paragraph of section 111(f) of title 17 of the 
United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553, and which remain in 
force under that provision. Two prorated adjustments, as prescribed in 
the fourth and fifth sentences of said definition, are permitted under 
certain conditions where:
    (A) A station is carried on a part-time basis where full-time 
carriage is not possible because the cable system lacks the activated 
channel capacity to

[[Page 443]]

retransmit on a full-time basis all signals which it is authorized to 
carry; and
    (B) A station is carried on a ``substitute'' basis under rules, 
regulations, or authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission 
in effect on October 19, 1976, which permitted a cable system, at its 
election, to omit the retransmission of a particular program and 
substitute another program in its place.
    (4) In computing a DSE, a cable system may round off to the third 
decimal point. If a DSE is rounded off in any case in a Statement of 
Account, it must be rounded off throughout the Statement. Where a cable 
system has chosen to round off, and the fourth decimal point for a 
particular DSE value would, without rounding off, have been 1, 2, 3, or 
4, the third decimal point remains unchanged; if, in such a case, the 
fourth decimal point would, without rounding off, be 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, 
the third decimal point must be rounded off to the next higher number.
    (5) For the purposes of computing DSE values, specialty primary 
television transmitters in the United States and all Canadian and 
Mexican primary television transmitters shall be assigned a value of 
one.
    (g) Computation of the copyright royalty fee: Partially distant 
stations. A cable system located partly within and partly without the 
local service area of a primary television transmitter (``partially 
distant station'') computes the royalty fee specified in section 
111(d)(1)(B) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of the Copyright Act (``DSE fee'') by 
excluding gross receipts from subscribers located within that station's 
local service area from total gross receipts. A cable system which 
carries two or more partially distant stations with local service areas 
that do not exactly coincide shall compute a separate DSE fee for each 
group of subscribers who are located outside of the local service areas 
of exactly the same complement of distant stations. Computation of the 
DSE fee for each subscriber group is to be based on:
    (1) The total distant signal equivalents of that group's complement 
of distant stations, and
    (2) The total gross receipts from that group of subscribers. The 
copyright royalty fee for that cable system is:
    (i) The total of the subscriber group royalty fees thus computed, or
    (ii) 0.956 of 1 percent of the system's gross receipts from all 
subscribers, whichever is larger.
    (h) Computation of the copyright royalty fee pursuant to the 1982 
cable rate adjustment. (1) For the purposes of this paragraph, in 
addition to the definitions of paragraph (b) of this section, the 
following definitions shall also apply:
    (i) Current base rate means the applicable royalty rates in effect 
on December 31, 1982, as reflected in 37 CFR 256.2(a).
    (ii) If the 3.75% rate does not apply to certain DSE's in the case 
of a cable system located wholly or in part within a top 100 television 
market, the current base rate together with the surcharge shall apply. 
However, the surcharge shall not apply for carriage of a particular 
signal first carried prior to March 31, 1972. With respect to statements 
of account covering the filing period beginning January 1, 1990, and 
subsequent filing periods, the current base rate together with the 
surcharge shall apply only to those DSE's that represent commercial VHF 
signals which place a predicted Grade B contour, in whole or in part, 
over a cable system. The surcharge will not apply if the signal is 
exempt from the syndicated exclusivity rules in effect on June 24, 1981.
    (iii) The 3.75% rate means the rate established by 37 CFR 256.2(c), 
in effect on March 15, 1983.
    (iv) Top 100 television market means a television market defined or 
interpreted as being within either the ``top 50 television markets'' or 
``second 50 television markets'' in accordance with 47 CFR 76.51, in 
effect on June 24, 1981.
    (v) The 1982 cable rate adjustment means the rate adjustment adopted 
by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal on October 20, 1982 (CRT Docket No. 
81-2, 47 FR 52146, November 19, 1982).
    (vi) The terms DSE or DSE's mean ``distant signal equivalent(s)'' as 
defined in 17 U.S.C. 111(f) and any fraction thereof.

[[Page 444]]

    (2) A cable system filing Form SA3 shall compute its royalty fee in 
the following manner:
    (i) The cable system shall first determine those DSE's to which the 
3.75% rate established by 37 CFR 256.2(c) applies.
    (ii) If the 3.75% rate does not apply to certain DSE's in the case 
of a cable system located wholly or in part within a top 100 television 
market, the current base rate together with the surcharge shall apply. 
However, the surcharge shall not apply for carriage of a particular 
signal first carried prior to March 31, 1972. With respect to statements 
of account covering the filing period beginning January 1, 1990, and 
subsequent filing periods, the current base rate together with the 
surcharge shall apply only to those DSE's that represent commercial VHF 
signals which place a predicted Grade B contour, in whole or in part, 
over a cable system. The surcharge will not apply if the signal is 
exempt from the syndicated exclusivity rules in effect on June 24, 1981.
    (iii) If the 3.75% rate does not apply to certain DSE's, in the case 
of a cable system located wholly outside a top 100 television market, 
the current base rate shall apply.
    (iv) Commencing with the semiannual accounting period of January 1, 
1998, through June 30, 1998, the 3.75% rate applies to certain DSE's 
with respect to the communities within the cable system where carriage 
would not have been permitted under the rules and regulations of the 
Federal Communications Commission in effect on June 24, 1981, but in all 
other communities within the cable system, the current base rate and the 
syndicated exclusivity surcharge, where applicable, shall apply. Such 
computation shall be made as provided for on Form SA3. The calculations 
shall be based upon the gross receipts from all subscribers, within the 
relevant communities, for the basic service of providing secondary 
transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters, without regard to 
whether those subscribers actually received the station in question. For 
partially-distant stations, gross receipts shall be the total gross 
receipts from subscribers outside the local service area.
    (3) A cable system whose semiannual gross receipts for secondary 
transmissions totalled $214,000 or more during the period January 1, 
1983, through June 30, 1983, shall compute its royalty fee for carriage 
during that period in the following manner:
    (i) Copyright royalty fees must be paid on the basis of carriage for 
the entire accounting period except where proration of the DSE is 
permitted as described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Where a distant signal was carried at any time only between 
January 1, 1983, and March 14, 1983;
    (A) In the case of a cable system located wholly or in part within a 
top 100 television market, the current base rate, together with the 
surcharge shall apply. However, the surcharge shall not apply for 
carriage of a particular signal first carried prior to March 31, 1972.
    (B) In case of a cable system located wholly outside a top 100 
television market, the current base rate shall apply.
    (iii) Where a distant signal was carried at any time after March 14, 
1983;
    (A) The cable system shall first determine those DSE's to which the 
3.75% rate established by 37 CFR 256.2(c) applies.
    (B) If the 3.75% rate is applicable to a particular DSE, it shall be 
applied against the per centum .5967 (representing the number of days 
from March 15, 1983, through June 30, 1983, inclusive, in relation to 
the entire accounting period); and either
    (1) In the case of a cable system located wholly or in part within a 
top 100 television market, the current base rate, together with the 
surcharge, applied against the per centum .4033 (representing the number 
of days from January 1, 1983, through March 14, 1983, inclusive, in 
relation to the entire accounting period); however, the surcharge shall 
not apply for carriage of a particular signal first carried prior to 
March 31, 1972; or
    (2) In the case of a cable system located wholly outside a top 100 
television market, the current base rate applied against the per centum 
.4033.

[[Page 445]]

    (C) If the 3.75% rate does not apply to certain DSE's, in the case 
of a cable system located wholly or in part within a top 100 television 
market, the current base rate together with the surcharge shall apply. 
However, the surcharge shall not apply for carriage of a particular 
signal first carried prior to March 31, 1972.
    (D) If the 3.75% rate does not apply to certain DSE's, in the case 
of a cable system located wholly outside a top 100 television market, 
the current base rate shall apply.
    (4)(i) Separate Supplemental DSE Schedules as prescribed by the 
Copyright Office shall be completed and filed by a cable system affected 
by the 1982 cable rate adjustment for the accounting periods January 1, 
1983, through June 30, 1983 (83-1), and July 1, 1983, through December 
31, 1983 (83-2). Each Supplemental DSE schedule shall contain the 
information required by that form and its accompanying instructions.
    (ii) The Supplemental DSE Schedule will be mailed to all cable 
systems whose gross receipts for secondary transmissions total $214,000 
or more either for accounting period 83-1 or for 83-2, and shall be 
completed and returned to the Copyright Office with the supplemental 
royalty fee due, if any, within sixty-five (65) days from the date of 
mailing by the Copyright Office.
    (iii) Cable systems located wholly outside all major and smaller 
television markets as defined by the FCC are not affected by the 1982 
cable rate adjustment. Such systems shall complete a certifying 
statement provided in the Supplemental DSE Schedule and return it within 
sixty-five (65) days from the date of mailing by the Copyright Office.
    (5)(i) It shall be presumed that the 3.75% rate of 37 CFR 308.2(c) 
applies to DSE's accruing from newly added distant signals, carried for 
the first time by a cable system after June 24, 1981.
    (ii) The presumption of paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section can be 
rebutted in whole or in part:
    (A) By actual carriage of a particular distant signal prior to June 
25, 1981, as reported in Statements of Account duly filed with the 
Copyright Office (``actual carriage''), unless the prior carriage was 
not permitted by the FCC; or
    (B) By carriage of no more than the number of distant signals which 
was or would have been allotted to the cable system under the FCC's 
quota for importation of network and nonspecialty independent stations 
(47 CFR 76.59(b), 76.61 (b) and (c) and 76.63, referring to 76.61 (b) 
and (c), in effect on June 24, 1981).
    (6) To qualify as an FCC-permitted signal on the ground of 
individual waiver of the FCC rules (47 CFR 76.7 in effect on June 24, 
1981), the waiver must have actually been granted by the FCC, and the 
signal must have been first carried by the cable system after April 15, 
1976.
    (7) Expanded geographic carriage after June 24, 1981, of a signal 
previously carried within only certain parts of a cable system is 
governed by the current base rate and the surcharge, if applicable.
    (8) In cases of expanded temporal carriage of the same signal, 
previously carried pursuant to the FCC's former part-time or substitute 
carriage rules (47 CFR 76.61(b)(2), 76.61 (e)(1) and (e)(3), and 76.63, 
referring to 76.61 (e)(1) and (e)(3), in effect on June 24, 1981), the 
3.75% rate shall be applied to any additional fraction of a DSE accruing 
from the expanded temporal carriage of that signal. To identify such 
additional DSE's, a comparison shall be made of DSE's reported for that 
signal in any single accounting period prior to the July 1, 1981, to 
December 31, 1981, period (81-2), as designated by the cable system, 
with the DSE's for that same signal reported in the current relevant 
accounting period.
    (9) Substitution of like signals pursuant to 37 CFR 256.2(c) is 
possible at the relevant non-3.75% rate (the surcharge together with the 
current base rate, or the current base rate alone) only if the 
substitution does not exceed the number of distant signals which was or 
would have been allotted to the cable system under the FCC's television 
market quota for importation of network and nonspecialty independent 
stations (47 CFR 76.59(b), 76.61 (b) and (c), and 76.63, referring to 
76.61 (b) and (c), in effect on June 24, 1981.

[[Page 446]]

    (i) Royalty fee payment. (1) All royalty fees may be paid by 
electronic transfer of funds, provided the payment is received in the 
designated United States Federal Reserve Bank by the filing deadline for 
the relevant accounting period. Except in the case of an electronic 
payment, the royalty fee payable for the period covered by the Statement 
of Account shall accompany that Statement of Account and shall be 
deposited at the Copyright Office with it. Payment must be in the form 
of a certified check, cashier's check, or a money order, payable to: 
Register of Copyrights; or a United States Treasury electronic payment.
    (2) Royalty fee payments submitted as a result of late or amended 
filings shall include interest. Interest shall begin to accrue beginning 
on the first day after the close of the period for filing statements of 
account for all underpayments of royalties for the cable compulsory 
license occurring within that accounting period. The accrual period 
shall end on the date appearing on the certified check, cashier's check, 
money order or electronic payment submitted by a cable system, provided 
that such payment is received by the Copyright Office within five 
business days of that date. If the payment is not received by the 
Copyright Office within five business days of its date, then the accrual 
period shall end on the date of actual receipt by the Copyright Office.
    (i) The interest rate applicable to a specific accounting period 
beginning with the 1992/2 period shall be the Current Value of Funds 
Rate, as established by section 8025.40 of the Treasury Financial Manual 
and published in the Federal Register, in effect on the first business 
day after the close of the filing deadline for that accounting period. 
Cable operators wishing to obtain the interest rate for a specific 
accounting period may do so by consulting the Federal Register for the 
applicable Current Value of Funds Rate, or by contacting the Licensing 
Division of the Copyright Office.
    (ii) The interest rate applicable to a specific accounting period 
earlier than the 1992/2 period shall be the rate fixed by the Licensing 
Division of the Copyright Office pursuant to 37 CFR 201.17(i) in effect 
on June 30, 1992.
    (iii) Interest is not required to be paid on any royalty 
underpayment or late payment from a particular accounting period if the 
interest charge is less than or equal to five dollars ($5.00).
    (j) Corrections, supplemental payments, and refunds. (1) Upon 
compliance with the procedures and within the time limits set forth in 
paragraph (j)(3) of this section, corrections to Statements of Account 
will be placed on record, supplemental royalty fee payments will be 
received for deposit, or refunds will be issued, in the following cases:
    (i) Where, with respect to the accounting period covered by a 
Statement of Account, any of the information given in the Statement 
filed in the Copyright Office is incorrect or incomplete;
    (ii) Where, for any reason except that mentioned in paragraph 
(j)(1)(iii) of this section, calculation of the royalty fee payable for 
a particular accounting period was incorrect, and the amount deposited 
in the Copyright Office for that period was either too high or too low; 
or
    (iii) Where, for the semiannual accounting period of January 1, 
1978, through June 30, 1978, the total royalty fee deposited was 
incorrect because the cable operator failed to compute royalties 
attributable to carriage of late-night, specialty, or part-time 
programming between January 1, 1978, and February 9, 1978.
    (2) Corrections to Statements of Account will not be placed on 
record, supplemental royalty fee payments will not be received for 
deposit, and refunds will not be issued, where the information in the 
Statements of Account, the royalty fee calculations, or the payments 
were correct as of the date on which the accounting period ended, but 
changes (for example, addition or deletion of a distant signal) took 
place later.
    (3) Requests that corrections to a Statement of Account be placed on 
record, that fee payments be accepted, or requests for the issuance of 
refunds, shall be made only in the cases mentioned in paragraph (j)(1) 
of this section. Such requests shall be addressed

[[Page 447]]

to the Licensing Division of the Copyright Office, and shall meet the 
following conditions:
    (i) The request must be in writing, must clearly identify its 
purpose, and, in the case of a request for a refund, must be received in 
the Copyright Office before the expiration of 60 days from the last day 
of the applicable Statement of Account filing period, or before the 
expiration of 60 days from the date of receipt at the Copyright Office 
of the royalty payment that is the subject of the request, whichever 
time period is longer. A request made by telephone or by telegraphic or 
similar unsigned communication, will be considered to meet this 
requirement if it clearly identifies the basis of the request, if it is 
received in the Copyright Office within the required 60-day period, and 
if a written request meeting all the conditions of this paragraph (j)(3) 
is also received in the Copyright Office within 14 days after the end of 
such 60-day period;
    (ii) The Statement of Account to which the request pertains must be 
sufficiently identified in the request (by inclusion of the name of the 
owner of the cable system, the community or communities served, and the 
accounting period in question) so that it can be readily located in the 
records of the Copyright Office;
    (iii) The request must contain a clear statement of the facts on 
which it is based and provide a clear basis on which a refund may be 
granted, in accordance with the following procedures:
    (A) In the case of a request filed under paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this 
section, where the information given in the Statement of Account is 
incorrect or incomplete, the request must clearly identify the erroneous 
or incomplete information and provide the correct or additional 
information;
    (B) In the case of a request filed under paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of 
this section, where the royalty fee was miscalculated and the amount 
deposited in the Copyright Office was either too high or too low, the 
request must be accompanied by an affidavit under the official seal of 
any officer authorized to administer oaths within the United States, or 
a statement in accordance with section 1746 of title 28 of the United 
States Code, made and signed in accordance with paragraph (e)(14) of 
this section. The affidavit or statement shall describe the reasons why 
the royalty fee was improperly calculated and include a detailed 
analysis of the proper royalty calculations;
    (C) In the case of a request filed under paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of 
this section, the request shall be identified as ``Transitional and 
Supplemental Royalty Fee Payment'' and include a detailed analysis of 
the proper royalty calculations;
    (iv)(A) All requests filed under this paragraph (j) (except those 
filed under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph) must be accompanied 
by a filing fee in the amount of $15 for each Statement of Account 
involved. Payment of this fee may be in the form of a personal or 
company check, or of a certified check, cashier's check or money order, 
payable to: Register of Copyrights. No request will be processed until 
the appropriate filing fees are received.
    (B) All requests that a supplemental royalty fee payment be received 
for deposit under this paragraph (j), must be accompanied by a 
remittance in the full amount of such fee. Payment of the supplemental 
royalty fee must be in the form of a certified check, cashier's check, 
or money order, payable to: Register of Copyrights; or an electronic 
payment. No such request will be processed until an acceptable 
remittance in the full amount of the supplemental royalty fee has been 
received.
    (v) All requests submitted under this paragraph (j) must be signed 
by the cable system owner named in the Statement of Account, or the duly 
authorized agent of the owner, in accordance with paragraph (e)(14) of 
this section.
    (vi) A request for a refund is not necessary where the Licensing 
Division, during its examination of a Statement of Account or related 
document, discovers an error that has resulted in a royalty overpayment. 
In this case, the Licensing Division will forward the royalty refund to 
the cable system owner named in the Statement of Account without regard 
to the time limitations provided for in paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this 
section.

[[Page 448]]

    (4) Following final processing, all requests submitted under this 
paragraph (j) will be filed with the original Statement of Account in 
the records of the Copyright Office. Nothing contained in this paragraph 
shall be considered to relieve cable systems from their full obligations 
under title 17 of the United States Code, and the filing of a correction 
or supplemental payment shall have only such effect as may be attributed 
to it by a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (k) Satellite carriers not eligible. Satellite carriers and 
satellite resale carriers are not eligible for the cable compulsory 
license based upon an interpretation of the whole of section 111 of 
title 17 of the United States Code.

Sec. 201.18  Notice of intention to obtain a compulsory license for making and distributing phonorecords of nondramatic musical works.

    (a) General. (1) A ``Notice of Intention'' is a notice identified in 
section 115(b) of title 17 of the United States Code, and required by 
that section to be served on a copyright owner, or in certain cases to 
be filed in the Copyright Office, to obtain a compulsory license to make 
and distribute phonorecords of nondramatic musical works.
    (2) A separate Notice of Intention shall be served or filed for each 
nondramatic musical work embodied, or intended to be embodied, in 
phonorecords made under the compulsory license.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the term copyright owner, in 
the case of any work having more than one copyright owner, means any one 
of the co-owners. In such cases, the service of a Notice of Intention on 
any one of the co-owners under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be 
sufficient with respect to all co-owners.
    (4) For the purposes of this section, a digital phonorecord delivery 
shall be treated as a type of phonorecord configuration, and a digital 
phonorecord delivery shall be treated as a phonorecord manufactured, 
made, and distributed on the date the phonorecord is digitally 
transmitted.
    (b) Form. The Copyright Office does not provide printed forms for 
the use of persons serving or filing Notices of Intention.
    (c) Content. (1) A Notice of Intention shall be clearly and 
prominently designated, at the head of the notice, as a ``Notice of 
Intention to Obtain a Compulsory License for Making and Distributing 
Phonorecords,'' and shall include a clear statement of the following 
information:
    (i) The full legal name of the person or entity intending to obtain 
the compulsory license, together with all fictitious or assumed names 
used by such person or entity for the purpose of conducting the business 
of making and distributing phonorecords;
    (ii) The full address, including a specific number and street name 
or rural route, of the place of business of the person or entity 
intending to obtain the compulsory license. A post office box or similar 
designation will not be sufficient for this purpose except where it is 
the only address that can be used in that geographic location;
    (iii) A statement of the nature of each and every business 
organization that the person or entity intending to obtain the 
compulsory license will use for the purpose of conducting the business 
of making and distributing phonorecords under the license (for example, 
a corporation, a partnership, or an individual proprietorship); 
additionally:
    (A) If the person or entity intending to obtain the compulsory 
license is a corporation registered with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission under section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 
the Notice shall so state.
    (B) If the person or entity intending to obtain the compulsory 
license is a corporation that is not registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act 
of 1934, the Notice shall include a list of the names of the 
corporation's directors and officers, and the names of each beneficial 
owner of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of

[[Page 449]]

the outstanding securities of the corporation.
    (C) In all other cases, the Notice shall include the names of each 
entity or individual owning a beneficial interest of twenty-five percent 
(25%) or more in the entity intending to exercise the compulsory 
license. If a corporate entity is named in response to this paragraph 
(C), then: If that corporation is registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act 
of 1934, the Notice shall so state; if that corporation is not so 
registered, the Notice shall include a list of the names of the 
corporation's directors and officers, and the names of each beneficial 
owner of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding securities 
of that corporation;
    (iv) The fiscal year of the person or entity intending to obtain the 
compulsory license. If that fiscal year is a calendar year, the Notice 
shall state that this is the case;
    (v) The title of the nondramatic musical work embodied or intended 
to be embodied in phonorecords made under the compulsory license, and 
the names of the author or authors of such work if known;
    (vi) The types of all phonorecord configurations already made (if 
any) and expected to be made under the compulsory license (for example: 
Single disk, long-playing disk, cassette, cartridge, reel-to-reel, a 
digital phonorecord delivery, or a combination of them);
    (vii) The expected date of initial distribution of phonorecords 
already made (if any) or expected to be made under the compulsory 
license;
    (viii) The name of the principal recording artist or group actually 
engaged or expected to be engaged in rendering the performances fixed on 
phonorecords already made (if any) or expected to be made under the 
compulsory license;
    (ix) The catalog number or numbers, and label name or names, used or 
expected to be used on phonorecords already made (if any) or expected to 
be made under the compulsory license; and
    (x) In the case of phonorecords already made (if any) under the 
compulsory license, the date or dates of such manufacture.
    (2) A ``clear statement'' of the information listed in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section requires a clearly intelligible, legible, and 
unambiguous statement in the Notice itself and (subject to paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section) without incorporation by reference of 
facts or information contained in other documents or records.
    (3) Where information is required to be given by paragraph (c)(1) of

Sec. 201.19  Royalties and statements of account under compulsory license for making and distributing phonorecords of nondramatic musical works.

    (a) Definitions. (1) A Monthly Statement of Account is a statement 
accompanying monthly royalty payments identified in section 115(c)(5) of 
title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553, and 
required by that section to be made under the compulsory license to make 
and distribute phonorecords of nondramatic musical works.
    (2) An Annual Statement of Account is a statement identified in 
section 115(c)(5) of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by 
Pub. L. 94-553, and required by that section to be filed for every 
compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of nondramatic 
musical works.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, the term copyright owner, in 
the case of any work having more than one copyright owner means any one 
of the co-owners. In such cases, the service of a Statement of Account, 
on one co-owner under paragraph (e)(7) or (f)(7) of this section shall 
be sufficient with respect to all co-owners.
    (4) For the purposes of this section, a compulsory licensee is a 
person or entity exercising the compulsory license to make and 
distribute phonorecords of nondramatic musical works as provided under 
section 115 of title 17 of the United States Code.
    (5) For the purposes of this section, a digital phonorecord delivery 
shall be treated as a type of phonorecord configuration, and a digital 
phonorecord delivery shall be treated as a phonorecord, with the 
following clarifications:
    (i) A digital phonorecord delivery shall be treated as a phonorecord 
made and distributed on the date the phonorecord is digitally 
transmitted; and
    (ii) A digital phonorecord delivery shall be treated as having been 
voluntarily distributed and relinquished from possession, and a 
compulsory licensee shall be treated as having permanently parted with 
possession of a digital phonorecord delivery, on the date that the 
phonorecord is digitally transmitted.
    (6) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5), a phonorecord is 
considered voluntarily distributed if the compulsory licensee has 
voluntarily and permanently parted with possession of the phonorecord. 
For this purpose, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of this 
section, a compulsory licensee

[[Page 451]]

shall be considered to have ``permanently parted with possession'' of a 
phonorecord made under the license:
    (i) In the case of phonorecords relinquished from possession for 
purposes other than sale, at the time at which the compulsory licensee 
actually first parts with possession;
    (ii) In the case of phonorecords relinquished from possession for 
purposes of sale without a privilege of returning unsold phonorecords 
for credit or exchange, at the time at which the compulsory licensee 
actually first parts with possession;
    (iii) In the case of phonorecords relinquished from possession for 
purposes of sale accompanied by a privilege of returning unsold 
phonorecords for credit or exchange:
    (A) At the time when revenue from a sale of the phonorecord is 
``recognized'' by the compulsory licensee; or
    (B) Nine months from the month in which the compulsory licensee 
actually first parted with possession, whichever occurs first.

For these purposes, a compulsory licensee shall be considered to 
``recognize'' revenue from the sale of a phonorecord when sales revenue 
would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles as expressed by the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, whichever would 
cause sales revenue to be recognized first.
    (7) To the extent that the terms reserve, credit and return appear 
in this section, such provisions shall not apply to digital phonorecord 
deliveries.
    (8) A phonorecord reserve comprises the number of phonorecords, if 
any, that have been relinquished from possession for purposes of sale in 
a given month accompanied by a privilege of return, as described in 
paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, and that have not been considered 
voluntarily distributed during the month in which the compulsory 
licensee actually first parted with their possession. The initial number 
of phonorecords comprising a phonorecord reserve shall be determined in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as expressed by 
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board.
    (9) A negative reserve balance comprises the aggregate number of 
phonorecords, if any, that have been relinquished from possession for 
purposes of sale accompanied by a privilege of return, as described in 
paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, and that have been returned to 
the compulsory licensee, but because all available phonorecord reserves 
have been eliminated, have not been used to reduce a phonorecord 
reserve.
    (10) An incomplete transmission is any digital transmission of a 
sound recording which, as determined by means within the sole control of 
the distributor, does not result in a specifically identifiable 
reproduction of the entire sound recording by or for any transmission 
recipient.
    (11) A retransmission is a subsequent digital transmission of the 
same sound recording initially transmitted to an identified recipient 
for the purpose of completing the delivery of a complete and usable 
reproduction of that sound recording to that recipient.
    (b) Accounting requirements where sales revenue is ``recognized''. 
Where under paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(A) of this section, revenue from the 
sale of phonorecords is ``recognized'' during any month after the month 
in which the compulsory licensee actually first parted with their 
possession, said compulsory licensee shall reduce particular phonorecord 
reserves by the number of phonorecords for which revenue is being 
``recognized,'' as follows:
    (1) If the number of phonorecords for which revenue is being 
``recognized'' is smaller than the number of phonorecords comprising the 
earliest eligible phonorecord reserve, this phonorecord reserve shall be 
reduced by the number of phonorecords for which revenue is being 
``recognized.'' Subject to the time limitations of subparagraph (B) of 
this Sec. 201.19(a)(5)(iii), the number of phonorecords remaining in 
this reserve shall be available for use in subsequent months.
    (2) If the number of phonorecords for which revenue is being 
``recognized'' is greater than the number of phonorecords comprising the 
earliest eligible phonorecord reserve but less

[[Page 452]]

than the total number of phonorecords comprising all eligible 
phonorecord reserves, the compulsory licensee shall first eliminate 
those phonorecord reserves, beginning with the earliest eligible 
phonorecord reserve and continuing to the next succeeding phonorecord 
reserves, that are completely offset by phonorecords for which revenue 
is being ``recognized.'' Said licensee shall then reduce the next 
succeeding phonorecord reserve by the number of phonorecords for which 
revenue is being ``recognized'' that have not been used to eliminate a 
phonorecord reserve. Subject to the time limitations of subparagraph (B) 
of this Sec. 201.19(a)(5)(iii), the number of phonorecords remaining in 
this reserve shall be available for use in subsequent months.
    (3) If the number of phonorecords for which revenue is being 
``recognized'' equals the number of phonorecords comprising all eligible 
phonorecord reserves, the person or entity exercising the compulsory 
license shall eliminate all of the phonorecord reserves.
    (c) Accounting requirements for offsetting phonorecord reserves with 
returned phonorecords. (1) In the case of a phonorecord that has been 
relinquished from possession for purposes of sale accompanied by a 
privilege of return, as described in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this 
section, where the phonorecord is returned to the compulsory licensee 
for credit or exchange before said compulsory licensee is considered to 
have ``permanently parted with possession'' of the phonorecord under 
paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the compulsory licensee may use such 
phonorecord to reduce a ``phonorecord reserve,'' as defined in paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section.
    (2) In such cases, the compulsory licensee shall reduce particular 
phonorecord reserves by the number of phonorecords that are returned 
during the month covered by the Monthly Statement of Account in the 
following manner:
    (i) If the number of phonorecords that are returned during the month 
covered by the Monthly Statement is smaller than the number comprising 
the earliest eligible phonorecord reserve, the compulsory licensee shall 
reduce this phonorecord reserve by the total number of returned 
phonorecords. Subject to the time limitations of paragraph (B) of 
Sec. 201.19(a)(5)(iii), the number of phonorecords remaining in this 
reserve shall be available for use in subsequent months.
    (ii) If the number of phonorecords that are returned during the 
month covered by the Monthly Statement is greater than the number of 
phonorecords comprising the earliest eligible phonorecord reserve but 
less than the total number of phonorecords comprising all eligible 
phonorecord reserves, the compulsory licensee shall first eliminate 
those phonorecord reserves, beginning with the earliest eligible 
phonorecord reserve, and continuing to the next succeeding phonorecord 
reserves, that are completely offset by returned phonorecords. Said 
licensee shall then reduce the next succeeding phonorecord reserve by 
the number of returned phonorecords that have not been used to eliminate 
a phonorecord reserve. Subject to the time limitations of paragraph (B) 
of Sec. 201.19(a)(5)(iii), the number of phonorecords remaining in this 
reserve shall be available for use in subsequent months.
    (iii) If the number of phonorecords that are returned during the 
month covered by the Monthly Statement is equal to or is greater than 
the total number of phonorecords comprising all eligible phonorecord 
reserves, the compulsory licensee shall eliminate all eligible 
phonorecord reserves. Where said number is greater than the total number 
of phonorecords comprising all eligible phonorecord reserves, said 
compulsory licensee shall establish a ``negative reserve balance,'' as 
defined in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (3) Except where a negative reserve balance exists, a separate and 
distinct phonorecord reserve shall be established for each month during 
which the compulsory licensee relinquishes phonorecords from possession 
for purposes of sale accompanied by a privilege of return, as described 
in paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section. In accordance with paragraph 
(B) of Sec. 201.19(a)(5)(iii), any phonorecord remaining in a particular 
phonorecord reserve nine months from the month in

[[Page 453]]

which the particular reserve was established shall be considered 
``voluntarily distributed''; at that point, the particular monthly 
phonorecord reserve shall lapse and royalties for the phonorecords 
remaining in it shall be paid as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of 
this section.
    (4) Where a negative reserve balance exists, the aggregate total of 
phonorecords comprising it shall be accumulated into a single balance 
rather than being separated into distinct monthly balances. Following 
the establishment of a negative reserve balance, any phonorecords 
relinquished from possession by the compulsory licensee for purposes of 
sale or otherwise, shall be credited against such negative balance, and 
the negative reserve balance shall be reduced accordingly. The nine-
month limit provided by paragraph (B) of Sec. 201.19(a)(5)(iii) shall 
have no effect upon a negative reserve balance; where a negative reserve 
balance exists, relinquishment from possession of a phonorecord by the 
compulsory licensee at any time shall be used to reduce such balance, 
and shall not be considered a ``voluntary distribution'' within the 
meaning of paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
    (5) In no case shall a phonorecord reserve be established while a 
negative reserve balance is in existence; conversely, in no case shall a 
negative reserve balance be established before all available phonorecord 
reserves have been eliminated.
    (d) Situations in which a compulsory licensee is barred from 
maintaining reserves. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this 
section, in any case where, within three years before the phonorecord 
was relinquished from possession, the compulsory licensee has had final 
judgment entered against it for failure to pay royalties for the 
reproduction of copyrighted music on phonorecords, or within such period 
has been definitively found in any proceeding involving bankruptcy, 
insolvency, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or 
similar action, to have failed to pay such royalties, that compulsory 
licensee shall be considered to have ``Permanently parted with 
possession'' of a phonorecord made under the license at the time at 
which that licensee actually first parts with possession. For these 
purposes the ``compulsory licensee,'' as defined in Sec. 201.19(a)(4), 
shall include:
    (1) In the case of any corporation, the corporation or any director, 
officer, or beneficial owner of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the 
outstanding securities of the corporation;
    (2) In all other cases, any entity or individual owning a beneficial 
interest of twenty-five percent (25%) or more in the entity exercising 
the compulsory license.
    (e) Monthly statements of account--(1) Forms. The Copyright Office 
does not provide printed forms for the use of persons serving Monthly 
Statements of Account.
    (2) General content. A Monthly Statement of Account shall be clearly 
and prominently identified as a ``Monthly Statement of Account Under 
Compulsory License for Making and Distributing Phonorecords,'' and shall 
include a clear statement of the following information:
    (i) The period (month and year) covered by the Monthly Statement;
    (ii) The full legal name of the compulsory licensee, together with 
all fictitious or assumed names used by such person or entity for the 
purpose of conducting the business of making and distributing 
phonorecords;
    (iii) The full address, including a specific number and street name 
or rural route, of the place of business of the compulsory licensee. A 
post office box or similar designation will not be sufficient for this 
purpose, except where it is the only address that can be used in that 
geographic location;
    (iv) The title or titles of the nondramatic musical work or works 
embodied in phonorecords made under the compulsory license and owned by 
the copyright owner being served with the Monthly Statement and the name 
of the author or authors of such work or works, if known;
    (v) For each nondramatic musical work that is owned by the same 
copyright owner being served with the Monthly Statement and that is 
embodied in phonorecords covered by the compulsory license, a detailed 
statement of all of the information called for in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section;

[[Page 454]]

    (vi) The total royalty payable for the month covered by the Monthly 
Statement, computed in accordance with the requirements of this section 
and the formula specified in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, together 
with a statement of account showing in detail how the royalty was 
computed; and
    (vii) In any case where the compulsory licensee falls within the 
provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, a clear description of the 
action or proceeding involved, including the date of the final judgment 
or definitive finding described in that paragraph.
    (3) Specific content of monthly statements: Identification and 
accounting of phonorecords. (i) The information called for by paragraph 
(e)(2)(v) of this section shall, with respect to each nondramatic 
musical work, include a separate listing of each of the following items 
of information:
    (A) The number of phonorecords, including digital phonorecord 
deliveries, made during the month covered by the Monthly Statement;
    (B) The number of phonorecords that, during the month covered by the 
Monthly Statement and regardless of when made, were either:

    Relinquished from possession for purposes other than sale;
    Relinquished from possession for purposes of sale without any 
privilege of returning unsold phonorecords for credit or exchange;
    Relinquished from possession for purposes of sale accompanied by a 
privilege of returning unsold phonorecords for credit or exchange;
    Returned to the compulsory licensee for credit or exchange;
    Placed in a phonorecord reserve (except that if a negative reserve 
balance exists give either the number of phonorecords added to the 
negative reserve balance, or the number of phonorecords relinquished 
from possession that have been used to reduce the negative reserve 
balance);
    Never delivered due to a failed transmission; or
    Digitally retransmitted in order to complete a digital phonorecord 
delivery.

    (C) The number of phonorecords, regardless of when made, that were 
relinquished from possession during a month earlier than the month 
covered by the Monthly Statement but that, during the month covered by 
the Monthly Statement either have had revenue from their sale 
``recognized'' under paragraph (a)(5)(iii) of this section, or were 
comprised in a phonorecord reserve that lapsed after nine months under 
paragraph (B) of Sec. 201.19(a)(5)(iii).
    (ii) Each of the items of information called for by paragraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this section shall also include, and if necessary shall be 
broken down to identify separately, the following:
    (A) The catalog number or numbers and label name or names, used on 
the phonorecords;
    (B) The names of the principal recording artist or group engaged in 
rendering the performances fixed on the phonorecords;
    (C) The playing time on the phonorecords of each nondramatic musical 
work covered by the statement; and
    (D) Each phonorecord configuration involved (for example: single 
disk, long-playing disk, cartridge, cassette, reel-to-reel, digital 
phonorecord delivery, or a combination of them).
    (E) The date of and a reason for each incomplete transmission.
    (4) Royalty payment and accounting. (i) The total royalty called for 
by paragraph (e)(2)(vi) of this section shall, as specified in section 
115(c)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code, be payable for every 
phonorecord ``voluntarily distributed'' during the month covered by the 
Monthly Statement.
    (ii) The amount of the royalty payment shall be calculated in 
accordance with the following formula:

    Step 1: Compute the number of phonorecords shipped for sale with a 
privilege of return. This is the total of phonorecords that, during the 
month covered by the Monthly Statement, were relinquished from 
possession by the compulsory licensee, accompanied by the privilege of 
returning unsold phonorecords to the compulsory licensee for credit or 
exchange. This total does not include: (1) Any phonorecords relinquished 
from possession by the compulsory licensee for purposes of sale without 
the privilege of return; and (2) any phonorecords relinquished from 
possession for purposes other than sale.
    Step 2: Subtract the number of phonorecords reserved. This involves 
deducting, from the subtotal arrived at in Step 1, the number of 
phonorecords that have been placed in the phonorecord reserve for the 
month covered by the Monthly Statement. The number of

[[Page 455]]

phonorecords reserved is determined by multiplying the subtotal from 
Step 1 by the percentage reserve level established under Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practices. This step should be skipped by a 
compulsory licensee barred from maintaining reserves under paragraph (d) 
of this section.
    Step 3: Add the total of all phonorecords that were shipped during 
the month and were not counted in Step 1. This total is the sum of two 
figures: (1) The number of phonorecords that, during the month covered 
by the Monthly Statement, were relinquished from possession by the 
compulsory licensee for purposes of sale, without the privilege of 
returning unsold phonorecords to the compulsory licensee for credit or 
exchange; and (2) the number of phonorecords relinquished from 
possession by the compulsory licensee, during the month covered by the 
Monthly Statement, for purposes other than sale.
    Step 4: Make any necessary adjustments for sales revenue 
``recognized,'' lapsed reserves, or reduction of negative reserve 
balance during the month. If necessary, this step involves adding to or 
subtracting from the subtotal arrived at in Step 3 on the basis of three 
possible types of adjustments:
    (a) Sales revenue ``recognized.'' If, in the month covered by the 
Monthly Statement, the compulsory licensee ``recognized'' revenue from 
the sale of phonorecords that had been relinquished from possession in 
an earlier month, the number of such phonorecords is added to the Step 3 
subtotal;
    (b) Lapsed reserves. If, in the month covered by the Monthly 
Statement, there are any phonorecords remaining in the phonorecord 
reserve for the ninth previous month (that is, any phonorecord reserves 
from the ninth previous month that have not been offset under FOFI, the 
first-out-first-in accounting convention, by actual returns during the 
intervening months), the reserve lapses and the number of phonorecords 
in it is added to the Step 3 subtotal.
    (c) Reduction of negative reserve balance. If, in the month covered 
by the Monthly Statement, the aggregate reserve balance for all previous 
months is a negative amount, the number of phonorecords relinquished 
from possession by the compulsory licensee during that month and used to 
reduce the negative reserve balance is subtracted from the Step 3 
subtotal.
    (d) Incomplete transmissions. If, in the month covered by the 
Monthly Statement, there are any digital transmissions of a sound 
recording which do not result in specifically identifiable reproductions 
of the entire sound recording by or for any transmission recipient, as 
determined by means within the sole control of the distributor, the 
number of such phonorecords is subtracted from the Step 3 subtotal.
    (e) Retransmitted digital phonorecords. If, in the month covered by 
the Monthly Statement, there are retransmissions of a digital 
phonorecord to a recipient who did not receive a complete and usable 
phonorecord during an initial transmission, and such transmissions are 
made for the sole purpose of delivering a complete and usable 
reproduction of the initially requested sound recording to that 
recipient, the number of such retransmitted digital phonorecords is 
subtracted from the Step 3 subtotal.
    Step 5: Multiply by the statutory royalty rate. The total monthly 
royalty payment is obtained by multiplying the subtotal from Step 3, as 
adjusted if necessary by Step 4, by the statutory royalty rate of 5.7 
cents or 1.1 cents per minute or fraction of playing time, whichever is 
larger.

    (iii) Each step in computing the monthly payment, including the 
arithmetical calculations involved in each step, shall be set out in 
detail in the Monthly Statement.
    (5) Clear statements. The information required by paragraphs (e) (2) 
and (3) of this section involves intelligible, legible, and unambiguous 
statements in the Monthly Statements of Account itself and without 
incorporation of facts or information contained in other documents or 
records.
    (6) Oath and signature. Each Monthly Statement of Account shall 
include the handwritten signature of the compulsory licensee. If that 
compulsory licensee is a corporation, the signature shall be that of a 
duly authorized officer of the corporation; if that compulsory licensee 
is a partnership, the signature shall be that of a partner. The 
signature shall be accompanied by:
    (i) The printed or typewritten name of the person signing the 
Monthly Statement of Account;
    (ii) The date of signature;
    (iii) If the compulsory licensee is a partnership or a corporation, 
by the title or official position held in the partnership or corporation 
by the person signing the Monthly Statement of Account;
    (iv) A certification of the capacity of the person signing; and
    (v) The following statement:

    I certify that I have examined this Monthly Statement of Account and 
that all statements of fact contained herein are true, complete, and 
correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, and are 
made in good faith.


[[Page 456]]


    (7) Service. (i) Each Monthly Statement of Account shall be served 
on the copyright owner to whom or which it is directed, together with 
the total royalty for the month covered by the Monthly Statement, by 
certified mail, or by registered mail on or before the 20th day of the 
immediately succeeding month. It shall not be necessary to file a copy 
of the Monthly Statement in the Copyright Office.
    (ii)(A) In any case where a Monthly Statement of Account is sent by 
certified mail or registered mail and is returned to the sender because 
the copyright owner is not located at that address or has refused to 
accept delivery, or in any case where an address for the copyright owner 
is not known, the Monthly Statement of Account, together with any 
evidence of mailing, may be filed in the Licensing Division of the 
Copyright Office. Any Monthly Statement of Account submitted for filing 
in the Copyright Office shall be accompanied by a brief statement of the 
reason why it was not served on the copyright owner. A written 
acknowledgement of receipt and filing will be provided to the sender.
    (B) The Copyright Office will not accept any royalty fees submitted 
with Monthly Statements of Account under Sec. 202.19(e)(7)(ii).
    (C) Neither the filing of a Monthly Statement of Account in the 
Copyright Office, nor the failure to file such Monthly Statement, shall 
have effect other than that which may be attributed to it by a court of 
competent jurisdiction.
    (D) No filing fee will be required in the case of Monthly Statements 
of Account submitted to the Copyright Office under this 
Sec. 201.19(e)(7)(ii). Upon request and payment of the fee specified in 
Sec. 201.3(e), a Certificate of Filing will be provided to the sender.
    (iii) A separate Monthly Statement of Account shall be served for 
each month during which there is any activity relevant to the payment of 
royalties under section 115 of Title 17, United States Code, and under 
this section. The Annual Statement of Account identified in paragraph 
(f) of this section does not replace any Monthly Statement of Account.
    (f) Annual statements of account--(1) Forms. The Copyright Office 
does not provide printed forms for the use of persons serving Annual 
Statements of Account.
    (2) Annual period. Any Annual Statement of Account shall cover the 
full fiscal year of the compulsory licensee.
    (3) General content. An Annual Statement of Account shall be clearly 
and prominently identified as an ``Annual Statement of Account Under 
Compulsory License for Making and Distributing Phonorecords,'' and shall 
include a clear statement of the following information:
    (i) The fiscal year covered by the Annual Statement;
    (ii) The full legal name of the compulsory licensee, together with 
all fictitious or assumed names used by such person or entity for the 
purpose of conducting the business of making and distributing 
phonorecords;
    (iii) A statement of the nature of the business organization used by 
the compulsory licensee in connection with the making and distribution 
of phonorecords (for example, a corporation, a partnership, or an 
individual proprietorship); additionally:
    (A) If the compulsory licensee is a corporation registered with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission under section 12 of the Securities 
and Exchange Act of 1934, the Annual Statement shall state that this is 
the case.
    (B) If the compulsory licensee is a corporation that is not

and the names of each beneficial owner of twenty-five percent (25%) or 
more of the outstanding securities of the corporation.
    (C) In all other cases, the Annual Statement shall include the names 
of each entity or individual owning a beneficial interest of twenty-five

owner of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the outstanding securities 
of that corporation;
    (iv) The full address, including a specific number and street name

geographic location;
    (v) The title or titles of the nondramatic musical work or works 
embodied in phonorecords made under the compulsory license and owned by 
the copyright owner being served with the Annual Statement and the name

statement of all of the information called for in paragraph (f)(4) of 
this section;
    (viii) The total royalty payable for the fiscal year covered by the 
Annual Statement computed in accordance with the requirements of this 
section, together with a statement of account showing in detail how the 
royalty was computed. For these purposes, the applicable royalty as 
specified in section 115(c)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code, 
shall be payable for every phonorecord ``voluntarily distributed'' 
during the fiscal year covered by the Annual Statement;
    (ix) The total sum paid under Monthly Statements of Account by the 
compulsory licensee to the copyright owner being served with the Annual 
Statement during the fiscal year covered by the Annual Statement; and
    (x) In any case where the compulsory license falls within the 
provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, a clear description of the 
action or proceeding involved, including the date of the final judgment 
or definitive finding described in that paragraph.
    (4) Specific content of annual statements: Identification and 
accounting of phonorecords. (i) The information called for by paragraph 
(f)(3)(vii) of this section shall, with respect to each nondramatic

    (A) The number of phonorecords made through the end of the fiscal 
year covered by the Annual Statement, including any made during earlier 
years;

relinquishment;
    (D) The number of phonorecords ``voluntarily distributed'' by the 
compulsory licensee during all years before the fiscal year covered by 
the Annual Statement;
    (E) The number of phonorecords relinquished from possession of the 
compulsory licensee for purposes of sale during the fiscal year covered 
by the Annual Statement accompanied by a privilege of returning unsold 
records for credit or exchange, but not ``voluntarily distributed'' by 
the end of that year;
    (F) The number of phonorecords ``voluntarily distributed'' by the 
compulsory licensee during the fiscal year covered by the Annual 
Statement, together with:
    (1) The catalog number or numbers, and label name or names, used on 
such phonorecords; and
    (2) The names of the principal recording artists or groups engaged

[[Page 458]]

Sec. 201.19(f)(4)(i) does not reconcile, the Annual Statement shall also 
include a clear and detailed explanation of the difference. For these 
purposes, the information given under such paragraphs shall be 
considered not to reconcile if, after the number of phonorecords given 
under paragraphs (B), (C), (D), and (E) are added together and that sum 
is deducted from the number of phonorecords given under paragraph (A), 
the result is different from the amount given under paragraph (F).
    (5) Clear statement. The information required by paragraph (f)(3) of 
this section involves intelligible, legible, and unambiguous statements 
in the Annual Statement of Account itself and [subject to paragraph 
(f)(3)(iii)(A)] without incorporation by reference of facts or 
information contained in other documents or records.
    (6) Signature and certification. (i) Each Annual Statement of 
Account shall include the handwritten signature of the compulsory 
licensee. If that compulsory licensee is a corporation, the signature

compulsory licensee is a partnership, the signature shall be that of a 
partner. The signature shall be accompanied by: (A) The printed or 
typewritten name of the person signing the Annual Statement of Account; 
(B) the date of signature; (C) if the compulsory licensee is a 
partnership or a corporation, by the title or official position held in 
the partnership or corporation by the person signing the Annual 
Statement of Account; and (D) a certification of the capacity of the 
person signing.
    (ii)(A) Each Annual Statement of Account shall also be certified by 
a licensed Certified Public Accountant. Such certification shall consist 
of the following statement:

    We have examined the attached ``Annual Statement of Account Under 
Compulsory License For Making and Distributing Phonorecords'' for the 
fiscal year ended (date) of (name of the compulsory licensee) applicable 
to phonorecords embodying (title or titles of nondramatic musical works 
embodied in phonorecords made under the compulsory license) made under 
the provisions of section 115 of title 17 of the United States Code, as 
amended by Pub. L. 94-553, and applicable regulations of the United 
States Copyright Office. Our examination was made in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards and accordingly, included tests of 
the accounting records and such other auditing procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances.
    In our opinion the Annual Statement of Account referred to above 
presents fairly the number of phonorecords embodying each of the above-
identified nondramatic musical works made under compulsory license and 
voluntarily distributed by (name of the compulsory licensee) during the 
fiscal year ending (date), and the amount of royalties applicable 
thereto under such compulsory license, on a consistent basis and in 
accordance with the above cited law and applicable regulations published 
thereunder.

<R05>
Sec. 201.20  Methods of affixation and positions of the copyright notice on various types of works.

    (a) General. (1) This section specifies examples of methods of 
affixation and positions of the copyright notice on various types of 
works that will satisfy the notice requirement of section 401(c) of 
title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553. A 
notice considered ``acceptable'' under this regulation shall be 
considered to satisfy the requirement of that section that it be 
``affixed to the copies in such manner and location as to give 
reasonable notice of the claim of copyright.'' As provided by that 
section, the examples specified in this regulation shall not be 
considered exhaustive of methods of affixation and positions giving 
reasonable notice of the claim of copyright.
    (2) The provisions of this section are applicable to copies publicly 
distributed on or after December 1, 1981. This section does not 
establish any rules concerning the form of the notice or the legal 
sufficiency of particular notices, except with respect to methods of 
affixation and positions of notice. The adequacy or legal sufficiency of 
a copyright notice is determined by the law in effect at the time of 
first publication of the work.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) The terms audiovisual works, collective works, copies, device, 
fixed, machine, motion picture, pictorial, graphic, and sculptural 
works, and their variant forms, have the meanings given to them in 
section 101 of title 17.
    (2) Title 17 means title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by 
Pub. L. 94-553.
    (3) In the case of a work consisting preponderantly of leaves on 
which the work is printed or otherwise reproduced on both sides, a 
``page'' is one side of a leaf; where the preponderance

[[Page 460]]

of the leaves are printed on one side only, the terms ``page'' and 
``leaf'' mean the same.
    (4) A work is published in book form if the copies embodying it 
consist of multiple leaves bound, fastened, or assembled in a 
predetermined order, as, for example, a volume, booklet, pamphlet, or 
multipage folder. For the purpose of this section, a work need not 
consist of textual matter in order to be considered published in ``book 
form.''
    (5) A title page is a page, or two consecutive pages facing each 
other, appearing at or near the front of the copies of a work published 
in book form, on which the complete title of the work is prominently 
stated and on which the names of the author or authors, the name of the 
publisher, the place of publication, or some combination of them, are 
given.
    (6) The meaning of the terms front, back, first, last, and 
following, when used in connection with works published in book form, 
will vary in relation to the physical form of the copies, depending upon 
the particular language in which the work is written.
    (7) In the case of a work published in book form with a hard or soft 
cover, the front page and back page of the copies are the outsides of 
the front and back covers; where there is no cover, the ``front page,'' 
and ``back page'' are the pages visible at the front and back of the 
copies before they are opened.
    (8) A masthead is a body of information appearing in approximately 
the same location in most issues of a newspaper, magazine, journal, 
review, or other periodical or serial, typically containing the title of 
the periodical or serial, information about the staff, periodicity of 
issues, operation, and subscription and editorial policies, of the 
publication.
    (9) A single-leaf work is a work published in copies consisting of a 
single leaf, including copies on which the work is printed or otherwise 
reproduced on either one side or on both sides of the leaf, and also 
folders which, without cutting or tearing the copies, can be opened out 
to form a single leaf. For the purpose of this section, a work need not 
consist of textual matter in order to be considered a ``single-leaf 
work.''
    (c) Manner of affixation and position generally. (1) In all cases 
dealt with in this section, the acceptability of a notice depends upon 
its being permanently legible to an ordinary user of the work under 
normal conditions of use, and affixed to the copies in such manner and 
position that, when affixed, it is not concealed from view upon 
reasonable examination.
    (2) Where, in a particular case, a notice does not appear in one of 
the precise locations prescribed in this section but a person looking in 
one of those locations would be reasonably certain to find a notice in 
another somewhat different location, that notice will be acceptable 
under this section.
    (d) Works published in book form. In the case of works published in 
book form, a notice reproduced on the copies in any of the following 
positions is acceptable:
    (1) The title page, if any;
    (2) The page immediately following the title page, if any;
    (3) Either side of the front cover, if any; or, if there is no front 
cover, either side of the front leaf of the copies;
    (4) Either side of the back cover, if any; or, if there is no back 
cover, either side of the back leaf of the copies;
    (5) The first page of the main body of the work;
    (6) The last page of the main body of the work;
    (7) Any page between the front page and the first page of the main 
body of the work, if:
    (i) There are no more than ten pages between the front page and the 
first page of the main body of the work; and
    (ii) The notice is reproduced prominently and is set apart from 
other matter on the page where it appears;
    (8) Any page between the last page of the main body of the work and 
back page, if:
    (i) There are no more than ten pages between the last page of the 
main body of the work and the back page; and
    (ii) The notice is reproduced prominently and is set apart from the 
other matter on the page where it appears.
    (9) In the case of a work published as an issue of a periodical or 
serial, in addition to any of the locations listed in paragraphs (d) (1) 
through (8) of this

[[Page 461]]

section, a notice is acceptable if it is located:
    (i) As a part of, or adjacent to, the masthead;
    (ii) On the page containing the masthead if the notice is reproduced 
prominently and is set apart from the other matter appearing on the 
page; or
    (iii) Adjacent to a prominent heading, appearing at or near the 
front of the issue, containing the title of the periodical or serial and 
any combination of the volume and issue number and date of the issue.
    (10) In the case of a musical work, in addition to any of the 
locations listed in paragraphs (d) (1) through (9) of this section, a 
notice is acceptable if it is located on the first page of music.
    (e) Single-leaf works. In the case of single-leaf works, a notice 
reproduced on the copies anywhere on the front or back of the leaf is 
acceptable.
    (f) Contributions to collective works. For a separate contribution 
to a collective work to be considered to ``bear its own notice of 
copyright,'' as provided by 17 U.S.C. 404, a notice reproduced on the 
copies in any of the following positions is acceptable:
    (1) Where the separate contribution is reproduced on a single page, 
a notice is acceptable if it appears:
    (i) Under the title of the contribution on that page;
    (ii) Adjacent to the contribution; or
    (iii) On the same page if, through format, wording, or both, the 
application of the notice to the particular contribution is made clear;
    (2) Where the separate contribution is reproduced on more than one 
page of the collective work, a notice is acceptable if it appears:
    (i) Under a title appearing at or near the beginning of the 
contribution;
    (ii) On the first page of the main body of the contribution;
    (iii) Immediately following the end of the contribution; or
    (iv) On any of the pages where the contribution appears, if:
    (A) The contribution is reproduced on no more than twenty pages of 
the collective work;
    (B) The notice is reproduced prominently and is set apart from other 
matter on the page where it appears; and
    (C) Through format, wording, or both, the application of the notice 
to the particular contribution is made clear;
    (3) Where the separate contribution is a musical work, in addition 
to any of the locations listed in paragraphs (f) (1) and (2) of this 
section, a notice is acceptable if it is located on the first page of 
music of the contribution;
    (4) As an alternative to placing the notice on one of the pages 
where a separate contribution itself appears, the contribution is 
considered to ``bear its own notice'' if the notice appears clearly in 
juxtaposition with a separate listing of the contribution by title, or 
if the contribution is untitled, by a description reasonably identifying 
the contribution:
    (i) On the page bearing the copyright notice for the collective work 
as a whole, if any; or
    (ii) In a clearly identified and readily-accessible table of 
contents or listing of acknowledgements appearing near the front or back 
of the collective work as a whole.
    (g) Works reproduced in machine-readable copies. For works 
reproduced in machine-readable copies (such as magnetic tapes or disks, 
punched cards, or the like, from which the work cannot ordinarily be 
visually perceived except with the aid of a machine or device,\1\ each 
of the following constitute examples of acceptable methods of affixation 
and position of notice:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Works published in a form requiring the use of a machine or 
device for purposes of optical enlargement (such as film, filmstrips, 
slide films, and works published in any variety of microform) and works 
published in visually perceptible form but used in connection with 
optical scanning devices, are not within this category.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) A notice embodied in the copies in machine-readable form in such 
a manner that on visually perceptible printouts it appears either with 
or near the title, or at the end of the work;
    (2) A notice that is displayed at the user's terminal at sign on;
    (3) A notice that is continuously on terminal display; or
    (4) A legible notice reproduced durably, so as to withstand normal 
use, on a gummed or other label securely affixed to the copies or to a 
box, reel,

[[Page 462]]

cartridge, cassette, or other container used as a permanent receptacle 
for the copies.
    (h) Motion pictures and other audiovisual works. (1) The following 
constitute examples of acceptable methods of affixation and positions of 
the copyright notice on motion pictures and other audiovisual works: A 
notice that is embodied in the copies by a photomechanical or electronic 
process, in such a position that it ordinarily would appear whenever the 
work is performed in its entirety, and that is located:
    (i) With or near the title;
    (ii) With the cast, credits, and similar information;
    (iii) At or immediately following the beginning of the work; or
    (iv) At or immediately preceding the end of the work.
    (2) In the case of an untitled motion picture or other audiovisual 
work whose duration is sixty seconds or less, in addition to any of the 
locations listed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, a notice that is 
embodied in the copies by a photomechanical or electronic process, in 
such a position that it ordinarily would appear to the projectionist or 
broadcaster when preparing the work for performance, is acceptable if it 
is located on the leader of the film or tape immediately preceding the 
beginning of the work.
    (3) In the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work that 
is distributed to the public for private use, the notice may be affixed, 
in addition to the locations specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section, on the housing or container, if it is a permanent receptacle 
for the work.
    (i) Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works. The following 
constitute examples of acceptable methods of affixation and positions of 
the copyright notice on various forms of pictorial, graphic, and 
sculptural works:
    (1) Where a work is reproduced in two-dimensional copies, a notice 
affixed directly or by means of a label cemented, sewn, or otherwise 
attached durably, so as to withstand normal use, of the front or back of 
the copies, or to any backing, mounting, matting, framing, or other 
material to which the copies are durably attached, so as to withstand 
normal use, or in which they are permanently housed, is acceptable.
    (2) Where a work is reproduced in three-dimensional copies, a notice 
affixed directly or by means of a label cemented, sewn, or otherwise 
attached durably, so as to withstand normal use, to any visible portion 
of the work, or to any base, mounting, framing, or other material on 
which the copies are durably attached, so as to withstand normal use, or 
in which they are permanently housed, is acceptable.
    (3) Where, because of the size or physical characteristics of the 
material in which the work is reproduced in copies, it is impossible or 
extremely impracticable to affix a notice to the copies directly or by 
means of a durable label, a notice is acceptable if it appears on a tag 
that is of durable material, so as to withstand normal use, and that is 
attached to the copy with sufficient durability that it will remain with 
the copy while it is passing through its normal channels of commerce.
    (4) Where a work is reproduced in copies consisting of sheet-like or 
strip material bearing multiple or continuous reproductions of the work, 
the notice may be applied:
    (i) To the reproduction itself;
    (ii) To the margin, selvage, or reverse side of the material at 
frequent and regular intervals; or
    (iii) If the material contains neither a selvage nor a reverse side, 
to tags or labels, attached to the copies and to any spools, reels, or 
containers housing them in such a way that a notice is visible while the 
copies are passing through their normal channels of commerce.
    (5) If the work is permanently housed in a container, such as a game 
or puzzle box, a notice reproduced on the permanent container is 
acceptable.

Sec. 201.21  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 201.22  Advance notices of potential infringement of works consisting of sounds, images, or both.

    (a) Definitions. (1) An Advance Notice of Potential Infringement is 
a notice

[[Page 463]]

which, if served in accordance with section 411(b) of title 17 of the 
United States Code, and in accordance with the provisions of this 
section, enables a copyright owner to institute an action for copyright 
infringement either before or after the first fixation of a work 
consisting of sounds, images, or both that is first fixed simultaneously 
with its transmission, and to enjoy the full remedies of said title 17 
for copyright infringement, provided registration for the work is made 
within three months after its first transmission.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the copyright owner of a work 
consisting of sounds, images, or both, the first fixation of which is 
made simultaneously with its transmission, is the person or entity that 
will be considered the author of the work upon its fixation (including, 
in the case of a work made for hire, the employer or other person or 
entity for whom the work was prepared), or a person or organization that 
has obtained ownership of an exclusive right, initially owned by the 
person or entity that will be considered the author of the work upon its 
fixation.
    (3) A transmission program is a body of material that, as an 
aggregate, has been produced for the sole purpose of transmission to the 
public in sequence and as a unit.
    (b) Form. The Copyright Office does not provide printed forms for 
the use of persons serving Advance Notices of Potential Infringement.
    (c) Contents. (1) An Advance Notice of Potential Infringement shall

    (ii) The date, specific time, and expected duration of the intended 
first transmission of the work or works contained in the specific 
transmission program;
    (iii) The source of the intended first transmission of the work or 
works;
    (iv) Clear identification, by title, of the work or works. A single 
Advance Notice of Potential Infringement may cover all of the works of 
the copyright owner embodied in a specific transmission program. If any 
work is untitled, the Advance Notice of Potential Infringement shall 
include a detailed description of that work;
    (v) The name of at least one person or entity that will be 
considered the author of the work upon its fixation;
    (vi) The identity of the copyright owner, as defined in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. If the copyright owner is not the person or 
entity that will be considered the author of the work upon its fixation, 
the Advance Notice of Potential Infringement also shall include a brief, 
general statement summarizing the means by which the copyright owner 
obtained ownership of the copyright and the particular rights that are 
owned; and
    (vii) A description of the relevant activities of the person 
responsible for the potential infringement which would, if carried out, 
result in an infringement of the copyright.
    (2) An Advance Notice of Potential Infringement must also include 
clear and prominent statements:
    (i) Explaining that the relevant activities may, if carried out, 
subject the person responsible to liability for copyright infringement; 
and
    (ii) Declaring that the copyright owner intends to secure copyright

    (4) Updating statements. Either the artist or owner of the building 
or both may record statements updating previously recorded information 
by submitting an updated statement and paying the recording fee 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Such statements should 
repeat the information disclosed in the previous filing as regarding the 
name of the artist(s), the name of the work(s) of visual art, the name 
and address of the building, and the name of the owner(s) of the 
building. The remaining portion of the statement should correct or 
supplement the information disclosed in the previously recorded 
statement.
    (d) Fee. The fee for recording a Visual Arts Registry Statement, a 
Building Owner's Statement, or an updating statement is the recordation 
fee for a document, as prescribed in Sec. 201.3(c).
    (e) Date of recordation. The date of recordation is the date when 
all of the elements required for recordation, including the prescribed

Copyright Office. Any documentation or photographs accompanying any 
submission will be retained and filed by the Copyright Office. They may 
also be transferred to the Library of Congress, or destroyed after 
preparing suitable copies, in accordance with usual procedures.
    (f) Effect of recordation. The Copyright Office will record 
statements in the Visual Arts Registry without examination or 
verification of the accuracy or completeness of the statement, if the 
statement is designated as a ``Visual Arts Registry Statement'' and 
pertains to a work of visual art incorporated in or made part of a 
building. Recordation of the statement and payment of the recording fee 
shall establish only the fact of recordation in the official record. 
Acceptance for recordation shall not be considered a determination that 
the statement is accurate, complete, and otherwise in compliance with 
section 113(d), title 17, U.S. Code. The accuracy and completeness of 
the statement is the responsibility of the artist or building owner who 
submits it for recordation. Artists and building owners are encouraged 
to submit accurate and complete statements. Omission of any information, 
however, shall not itself invalidate the recordation, unless a court of 
competent jurisdiction finds the statement

[[Page 467]]

is materially deficient and fails to meet the minimum requirements of 
section 113(d) of title 17, U.S. Code.

    (4) Early or late filings. Statements of Account and royalty fees 
received before the end of the particular accounting period covered by 
the statement will not be processed by the Office. The statement must be 
filed after the close of the relevant accounting period. Statements of 
Account and royalty fees received after the 45-day deadline for 
quarterly statements or the two-month deadline for annual statements 
will be accepted for whatever legal effect they may have and will be 
assessed the appropriate interest charge for the late filing.
    (d) Forms. (1) Each quarterly or annual Statement of Account shall 
be submitted on the appropriate form prescribed by the Copyright Office. 
Computation of the royalty fee shall be in accordance with the 
procedures set forth in the forms and this section. Statement of Account 
forms are available from the Licensing Division, Library of Congress.

(Form DART/Q) and Annual Statement of Account for Digital Audio 
Recording Products (Form DART/A).
    (e) Contents of quarterly Statements of Account. (1) Quarterly 
period and filing. Any quarterly Statement of Account shall cover the 
full quarter of the calendar or fiscal accounting year for the 
particular quarter for which it is filed. A separate quarterly statement 
shall be filed for each quarter of the first three quarters of the 
accounting year during which there is any activity relevant to the 
payment of royalties under 17 U.S.C. 1004. The annual Statement of 
Account identified in paragraph (f) of this section incorporates the 
fourth quarter of the accounting year.
    (2) General content. Each quarterly Statement of Account shall be 
filed on Form DART/Q, the ``Quarterly Statement of Account for Digital 
Audio Recording Products,'' and shall include a clear statement of the 
following information:
    (i) A designation of the calendar or fiscal year of the annual 
reporting period;
    (ii) A designation of the period, including the beginning and ending 
day, month, and year of the period covered by the quarter;
    (iii) The full legal name of the manufacturing and/or importing

importing, or distributing digital audio recording products;
    (iv) The full mailing address of the manufacturing or importing 
party, including a specific number and street name, or rural route and 
box number, of the place of business of the person or entity. A post 
office box or similar designation will not be sufficient for this

geographic location;
    (v) A designation of the manufacturing or importing party status, 
i.e., ``Manufacturer,'' ``Importer,'' or ``Manufacturer and Importer;''
    (vi) The designation ``Product Categories'' together with the

quarter covered by the statement;
    (ix) The ``fee code'' associated with the product;
    (x) The ``source code'' for the product category;
    (xi) The ``transfer price'' of the product;

devices or media;
    (xv) The ``rate fee'' for each product;
    (xvi) The appropriate ``maximum fee per unit'' for each product;
    (xvii) The ``maximum fee'' for each product; and
    (xviii) A computation of the total royalty payable for the quarter

they list in Space C, the computation section of the form, except for 
the figure representing the total royalty fee due; in that case, numbers 
ending in 50 to 99 cents may be rounded up to the next dollar, and 
numbers ending in one to 49 cents may be rounded down to the next 
dollar;
    (3) Royalty payments and accounting. (i) The royalty specified in 17 
U.S.C. 1004 shall accompany the quarterly and annual Statements of 
Account. No royalty is payable for redistribution of the same product 
item unless a credit has been taken for such items. Where royalties are 
payable for the period covered by the statement, the Statement of 
Account shall contain the following information for each unique 
combination of product category, technology, series or model number, fee 
code, source code, and transfer price:
    (A) The total number of digital audio recording media distributed, 
multiplied by the statutory royalty rate of three percent (3%) of the 
transfer price;

for which the statutory royalty rate of two percent (2%) of the transfer 
price is payable, multiplied by such percentage rate of the transfer 
price;

for which the statutory minimum royalty is limited to one dollar 
($1.00), multiplied by such one dollar amount.
    (ii) The amount of the royalty payment shall be calculated in 
accordance with the instructions specified in the quarterly Statement of 
Account form. Payment of the royalty fee must be in the form of a 
certified check, cashier's check, money order, or electronic payment 
payable to the Register of Copyrights.
    (4) Reduction of royalty fee. (i) Section 1004(a)(2)(A) of title 17 
of the United States Code, provides an instance in which royalty 
payments may be reduced if the digital audio recording device and such 
other devices are part of a physically integrated unit, the royalty 
payment shall be based on the transfer price of the unit, but shall be 
reduced by any royalty payment made on any digital audio recording 
device included within the unit that was not first distributed in 
combination with the unit.
    (ii) Notice of this provision together with directions for possible 
application to a product is contained in the DART/Q Form.
    (5) Contact party. Each Statement of Account shall include the name, 
address, and telephone and facsimile (FAX) numbers of an individual whom 
the Copyright Office can write or call about the Statement of Account.

[[Page 473]]

    (6) Credits for returned or exported products. When digital audio 
recording products first distributed in the United States for ultimate 
transfer to United States consumers are returned to the manufacturer or 
importer as unsold or defective merchandise, or are exported, the 
manufacturing or importing party may take a credit to be deducted from 
the royalties payable for the period when the products were returned or 
exported. The credit may be taken only for returns or exports made 
within two years following the date royalties were paid for the 
products. This credit must be reflected in the manufacturing or 
importing party's quarterly or annual Statement of Account. If the 
manufacturer or importer later redistributes in the United States any 
products for which a credit has been taken, these products must be 
listed on the Statement of Account, and a new computation of the royalty 
fee must be made based on the transfer price of the products at the time 
of the new distribution.
    (7) Oath and signature. Each Statement of Account shall include the 
handwritten signature of an authorized officer, principal, or agent of 
the filing party. The signature shall be accompanied by:
    (i) The printed or typewritten name of the person signing the 
quarterly Statement of Account;
    (ii) The date the document is signed;
    (iii) The following certification:

    I, the undersigned, hereby certify that I am an authorized officer, 
principal, or agent of the ``manufacturing or importing party'' 
identified in Space B.


Penalties for fraud and false statements are provided under 18 U.S.C. 
1001 et. seq.
    (f) Contents of annual Statements of Account--(1) General contents. 
Each annual Statement of Account shall be filed on form DART/A, ``Annual 
Statement of Account for Digital Audio Recording Products.'' It must be 
filed by any importer or manufacturer that distributed in the United 
States, during a given calendar or fiscal year, any digital audio 
recording device or digital audio recording medium. The annual statement 
shall cover the aggregate of the distribution of devices and media for 
the entire year corresponding to the calendar or fiscal year elected. 
The annual Statement of Account shall contain the information, oath, and 
certification prescribed in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(7)(iii) of 
this section, and shall cover the entire accounting year, including the 
fourth quarter distribution, and shall also provide for the 
reconciliation of the aggregated accounting of digital audio recording 
devices and media for the reported accounting year.
    (2) Reconciliation. Any royalty payment due under sections 1003 and 
1004 of title 17 that was not previously paid with the filing party's 
first three quarterly Statements of Account, shall be reconciled in the 
annual statement. Reconciliation in the annual Statement of Account 
provides for adjustments for reductions, refunds, underpayments, 
overpayments, credits, and royalty payments paid in Quarters 1, 2, and 
3, and shall be computed in accordance with the instructions included in 
the annual Statement of Account. Errors that require reconciliation 
shall be corrected immediately upon discovery.
    (3) Accountant's opinion. Each annual Statement of Account or any 
amended annual Statement of Account shall be audited by the primary 
auditor as defined in paragraph (b)(7) of this section. An amendment may 
be submitted to the Office either as a result of responses to questions 
raised by a Licensing Division examiner or on the initiative of the 
manufacturing or importing party to correct an error in the original 
Statement of Account.
    (i) The audit shall be performed in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards (GAAS). The audit may be performed in 
conjunction with an annual audit of the manufacturing or importing 
party's financial statements.
    (ii) The CPA shall issue a report, the ``primary auditor's report,'' 
reflecting his or her opinion as to whether the annual statement 
presents fairly, in all material respects, the number of digital audio 
recording devices and media that were imported and distributed, or 
manufactured and distributed, by the manufacturing or importing party 
during the relevant year, and the amount

[[Page 474]]

of royalty payments applicable to them under 17 U.S.C. chapter 10, in 
accordance with that law and these regulations.
    (iii) The primary auditor's report shall be filed with the Copyright 
Office together with the annual Statement of Account, within two months 
after the end of the annual period for which the annual Statement of 
Account is prepared. The report may be qualified to the extent necessary 
and appropriate.
    (iv) The Copyright Office does not provide a specific form, or 
require a specific format, for the CPA's review; however, in addition to 
the above, certain items must be named as audited items. These include 
the variables necessary to complete Space C of the Statement of Account 
form. The CPA may place his or her opinion, which will serve as the 
``primary auditor's report,'' in the space provided on Form DART/A, or 
may attach a separate sheet or sheets containing the opinion.
    (v) The auditor's report shall be signed by an individual, or in the 
name of a partnership or a corporation, and shall include city and state 
of execution, certificate number, jurisdiction of certificate, and date 
of opinion. The certificate number and jurisdiction are not required if 
the report is signed in the name of a partnership or a corporation.
    (g) Documentation. All filing parties shall keep and retain in their 
possession, for at least three years from the date of filing, all 
records and documents necessary and appropriate to support fully the 
information set forth in quarterly and annual statements that they file.
    (h) Corrections, supplemental payments, and refunds--(1) General. 
Upon compliance with the procedures and within the time limits set forth 
in this paragraph (h), corrections to quarterly and annual Statements of 
Account will be placed on record, and supplemental royalty fee payments 
will be received for deposit, or refunds without interest will be 
issued, in the following cases:
    (i) Where, with respect to the accounting period covered by the 
quarterly or annual Statement of Account, any of the information given 
in the statement filed in the Copyright Office is incorrect or 
incomplete; or
    (ii) Where, for any reason except that mentioned in paragraph (h)(2) 
of this section, calculation of the royalty fee payable for a particular 
accounting period was incorrect, and the amount deposited in the 
Copyright Office for that period was either too high or too low.
    (2) Corrections to quarterly or annual Statements of Account will 
not be placed on file, supplemental royalty fee payments will not be 
received for deposit, and refunds will not be issued, where the 
information in the Statements of Account, the royalty fee calculations, 
or the payments were correct as of the date on which the accounting 
period ended, but changes (for example, cases where digital audio 
recording media were exported) took place later.
    (3) Requests that corrections to annual or quarterly Statements of 
Account be accepted, that fee payments be accepted, or that refunds be 
issued shall be addressed to the Licensing Division of the Copyright 
Office, and shall meet the following conditions:
    (i) The request shall be made in writing and must clearly identify 
the manufacturing or importing party making the request, the accounting 
period in question, and the purpose of the request. A request for a 
refund must be received in the Copyright Office before the expiration of 
two months from the last day of the applicable Statement of Account 
filing period. A request made by telephone or by telegraphic or similar 
unsigned communication will be considered to meet this requirement if it 
clearly identifies the basis of the request, is received in the 
Copyright Office within the two-month period, and a written request 
meeting all the conditions of this paragraph (h)(3) is also received in 
the Copyright Office within 14 days after the end of such two-month 
period.
    (ii) The request must clearly identify the incorrect or incomplete 
information formerly filed and must provide the correct or additional 
information.
    (iii) In the case where a royalty fee was miscalculated and the 
amount deposited with the Copyright Office was too large or too small, 
the request must be accompanied by an affidavit under the official seal 
of any officer authorized to administer oaths within the

[[Page 475]]

United States, or a statement in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746, made 
and signed in accordance with paragraph (e)(7) of this section. The 
affidavit or statement shall describe the reasons why the royalty fee 
was improperly calculated and include a detailed analysis of the proper 
royalty calculation.
    (iv) Following final processing, all requests will be filed with the 
original Statement of Account in the records of the Copyright Office. 
Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be considered to relieve 
manufacturing or importing parties of their full obligations under title 
17 of the United States Code, and the filing of a correction or 
supplemental payment shall have only such effect as may be attributed to 
it by a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (v)(A) The request must be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount 
of $20 for each Statement of Account involved. Payment of this fee may 
be in the form of a personal or company check, or a certified check, 
cashier's check, or money order, payable to the Register of Copyrights. 
No request will be processed until the appropriate filing fees are 
received.
    (B) Requests that a supplemental royalty fee payment be deposited 
must be accompanied by a remittance in the full amount of such fee. 
Payment of the supplemental royalty fee must be in the form of a 
certified check, cashier's check, money order, or electronic payment 
payable to the Register of Copyrights. No such request will be processed 
until an acceptable remittance in the full amount of the supplemental 
royalty fee has been received.
    (vi) All requests submitted under paragraph (h) of this section must 
be signed by the manufacturing or importing party named in the Statement 
of Account, or the duly authorized agent of that party in accordance 
with paragraph (e)(7) of this section.
    (vii) A request for a refund is not necessary where the Licensing 
Division, during its examination of a Statement of Account or related 
document, discovers an error that has resulted in a royalty overpayment. 
In this case, the Licensing Division will forward the royalty refund to 
the manufacturing or importing party named in the Statement of Account. 
The Copyright Office will not pay interest on any royalty refunds.
    (i) Examination of Statements of Account by the Copyright Office. 
(1) Upon receiving a Statement of Account and royalty fee, the Copyright 
Office will make an official record of the actual date when such 
statement and fee were physically received in the Copyright Office. 
Thereafter, the Licensing Division will examine the statement for 
obvious errors or omissions appearing on the face of the documents and 
will require that any such obvious errors or omissions be corrected 
before final processing of the document is completed. If, as the result 
of communications between the Copyright Office and the manufacturer or 
importer, an additional fee is deposited or changes or additions are 
made in the Statement of Account, the date that additional deposit or 
information was actually received in the Office will be added to the 
official record.
    (2) Completion by the Copyright Office of the final processing of a 
Statement of Account and royalty fee deposit shall establish only the 
fact of such completion and the date or dates of receipt shown in the 
official record. It shall not be considered a determination that the 
Statement of Account was, in fact, properly prepared and accurate, that 
the correct amount of the royalty was deposited, that the statutory time 
limits for filing had been met, or that any other requirements of 17 
U.S.C. 1001 et. seq. were fulfilled.
    (j) Interest on late payments or underpayments. (1) Royalty payments 
submitted as a result of late payments or underpayments shall include 
interest, which shall begin to accrue on the first day after the close 
of the period for filing Statements of Account for all late payments or 
underpayments of royalties occurring within that accounting period. The 
accrual period for interest shall end on the date appearing on the 
certified check, cashier's check, money order, or electronic payment 
submitted by the manufacturing or importing party, if the payment is 
received by the Copyright Office within five business days of that date. 
If the payment is not received by the Copyright Office within

[[Page 476]]

five business days of its date, the accrual period shall end on the date 
of actual receipt by the Copyright Office.
    (2) The interest rate applicable to a specific accounting period 
shall be the Current Value of Funds rate in accordance with the Treasury 
Financial Manual, at 1 TFM 6-8025.40, in effect on the first business 
day after the close of the filing deadline for the relevant accounting 
period. The interest rate for a particular accounting period may be 
obtained by consulting the Federal Register for the applicable Current 
Value of Funds Rate, or by contacting the Licensing Division of the 
Copyright Office.
    (3) Interest is not required to be paid on any royalty underpayment 
or late payment from a particular accounting period if the interest 
charge is five dollars ($5.00) or less.
    (k) Confidentiality of Statements of Account. Public access to the 
Copyright Office files of Statements of Account for digital audio 
recording products shall not be provided. Access will only be granted to 
interested copyright parties in accordance with regulations prescribed 
by the Register of Copyrights pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 1003(c).

interested copyright parties pursuant to section 1003(c) of title 17 of 
the United States Code.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Annual Statement of Account, generally accepted

conduct the primary audit properly or to obtain a reliable result, or 
whether there was any error in the Annual Statement of Account.
    (d) Timing of verification procedure--(1) Requesting a verification 
procedure. No sooner than three months nor later than three years after 
the filing deadline of the Annual Statement of Account to be verified, 
any interested copyright party shall notify the Register of Copyrights 
of its interest in instituting a verification procedure. Such 
notification of interest shall also be served at the same time on the 
filer and the primary auditor identified in the Annual Statement of 
Account. Such notification shall include the year of the Annual 
Statement of Account to be verified, the name of the filer, information 
on how other interested copyright parties may contact the party 
interested in the verification including name, address, telephone 
number, facsimile number and electronic mail address, if any, and a 
statement establishing the party filing the notification as an 
interested copyright party. The notification of interest may apply to 
more than one Annual Statement of Account and more than one filer.
    (2) Coordination and selection of verifying auditor. The Copyright 
Office will publish in the Federal Register notice of having received a 
notification

[[Page 479]]

of interest to institute a verification procedure. Interested copyright 
parties have one month from the date of publication of the Federal 
Register notice to notify the party interested in instituting the 
verification procedure of their intent to join with it and to 
participate in the selection of the verifying auditor. Any dispute about 
the selection of the verifying auditor shall be resolved by the parties 
themselves.
    (3) Notification of the filer and primary auditor. As soon as the 
verifying auditor has been selected, and in no case later than two 
months after the publication in the Federal Register of the notice 
described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the joint interested 
copyright parties shall notify the Register of Copyrights, the filer, 
and the primary auditor identified in the Annual Statement of Account to 
be verified, that they intend or do not intend to initiate a 
verification procedure.
    (4) Commencement of the verification procedure. The verification 
procedure shall begin no sooner than one month after notice of intent to 
initiate a verification procedure was given to the filer and the primary 
auditor by the joint interested copyright parties. The joint interested 
copyright parties shall grant the filer or the primary auditor a 
postponement of the beginning of the verification procedure of up to one 
additional month if either one requests it. Verification procedures 
shall be conducted at reasonable times during normal business hours.
    (5) Anti-duplication rules. A filer shall be subject to no more than 
one verification procedure per calendar year. An Annual Statement of 
Account shall be subject to a verification procedure only once.
    (e) Scope of verification. The verifying auditor shall limit his or 
her examination to verifying the information required in the Annual 
Statement of Account. To the extent possible, the verifying auditor 
shall inspect the information contained in the primary auditor's report 
and the primary auditor's working papers. If the verifying auditor 
believes that access to the records, files, or other materials in the 
control of the filer is required according to GAAS, he or she may, after 
consultation with the primary auditor, require the production of these 
documents as well. The verifying auditor and the primary auditor shall 
act in good faith using reasonable professional judgment, with the 
intention of reaching a reasonable accommodation as to the necessity and 
scope of examination of any additional documents, but the decision to 
require the production of additional documents is solely that of the 
verifying auditor.
    (f) Verification report. Upon concluding the verification procedure, 
the verifying auditor shall render a report enumerating in reasonable 
detail the procedures performed by the verifying auditor and his or her 
findings. Such findings shall state whether there was any failure of the 
primary auditor to conduct properly the primary audit or obtain a 
reliable result, and whether there was any error in the Annual Statement 
of Account, itemized by amount and by the filer's elected fiscal year. 
If there was such failure or error, the report shall specify all 
evidence from which the verifying auditor reached such conclusions. Such 
evidence shall be listed and identified in an appendix to the report in 
sufficient detail to enable a third party to reasonably understand or 
interpret the evidence on which the verifying auditor based his or her 
conclusion. If there was no such failure or error, the report shall so 
state.
    (g) Distribution of report. Copies of the verifying auditor's report 
shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of Sec. 201.29 and 
shall be distributed as follows:
    (1) One copy, excluding the appendix, if applicable, shall be filed 
with the Register of Copyrights.
    (2) One copy, with the appendix, if applicable, shall be submitted 
to each of the interested copyright parties who retained the services of 
the verifying auditor and who are authorized to receive such information 
according to Sec. 201.29.
    (3) One copy, with the appendix, if applicable, shall be submitted 
to the filer of the Annual Statement of Account.
    (4) One copy, with the appendix, if applicable, shall be submitted 
to the primary auditor.

[[Page 480]]

    (h) Retention of report. The Register of Copyrights will retain his 
or her copy of the verifying auditor's report for three years following 
the date the copy of the verifying auditor's report is filed.
    (i) Costs of verification. The joint interested copyright parties 
who requested the verification procedure shall pay the fees of the 
verifying auditor and the primary auditor for their work performed in 
connection with the verification procedure, except, if the verification 
procedure results in a judicial determination or the filer's agreement 
that royalty payments were understated on the Annual Statement of 
Account, then,
    (1) if the amount is less than five percent (5%) of the amount 
stated on the Annual Statement of Account, that amount shall first be 
used to pay the fees of the verifying auditor and the primary auditor, 
and any remaining amount plus any applicable interest on the total 
amount shall be deposited, allocated by the filer's elected fiscal year, 
with the Register of Copyrights, or
    (2) if the amount is equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of 
the amount stated on the Annual Statement of Account, the filer shall 
pay the fees of the verifying auditor and the primary auditor, and, in 
addition, shall deposit the amount found to be due plus any applicable 
interest on the total amount, allocated by the filer's elected fiscal 
year, with the Register of Copyrights.
    (j) Independence and qualifications of verifying auditor. (1) The 
verifying auditor shall be qualified and independent as defined in this 
section. If the filer has reason to believe that the verifying auditor 
is not qualified or independent, it shall raise the matter with the 
joint interested copyright parties before the commencement of the 
verification procedure, and if the matter is not resolved, it may raise 
the issue with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' 
Professional Ethics Division and/or the verifying auditor's State Board 
of Accountancy while the verification procedure is being performed.
    (2) A verifying auditor shall be considered qualified if he or she 
is a certified public accountant or works under the supervision of a 
certified public accounting firm.
    (3) A verifying auditor shall be considered independent if:
    (i) He or she is independent as that term is used in the Code of 
Professional Conduct of the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants, including the Principles, Rules and Interpretations of such 
Code applicable generally to attest engagements (collectively, the 
``AICPA Code''); and
    (ii) He or she is independent as that term is used in the Statements 
on Auditing Standards promulgated by the Auditing Standards Board of the 
AICPA and Interpretations thereof issued by the Auditing Standards 
Division of the AICPA.

Sec. 201.31  Procedures for copyright restoration in the United States for certain motion pictures and their contents in accordance with the North American Free 
          Trade Agreement.

    (a) General. This section prescribes the procedures for submission 
of Statements of Intent pertaining to the restoration of copyright 
protection in the United States for certain motion pictures and works 
embodied therein as required by the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (NAFTA) of December 8, 1993, Public Law No. 103-182. 
On or after January 3, 1995, the Copyright Office will publish in the 
Federal Register a list of works for which potential copyright owners 
have filed a complete and timely Statement of Intent with the Copyright 
Office.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:
    (1) Effective filing. To be effective a Statement of Intent must be 
complete and timely.
    (2) Eligible work means any motion picture that was first fixed or 
published in Mexico or Canada, and any work included in such motion 
picture that was first fixed or published with this motion picture, if 
the work entered the public domain in the United States because it was 
first published on or after January 1, 1978, and before

[[Page 481]]

March 1, 1989, without the notice required by 17 U.S.C. 401, 402, or 
403, the absence of which has not been excused by the operation of 17 
U.S.C. 405, as such sections were in effect during that period.
    (3) Fixed means a work `fixed' in a tangible medium of expression 
when its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority 
of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be 
perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more 
than transitory duration. A work consisting of sounds, images, or both, 
that are being transmitted, is `fixed' for purposes of this title if a 
fixation of the work is being made simultaneously with its transmission. 
17 U.S.C. 101
    (4) Potential copyright owner means the person who would have owned 
any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright in the United 
States in a work eligible for copyright restoration under NAFTA, if the 
work had not fallen into the public domain for failure to comply with 
the statutory notice requirements in effect at the time of first 
publication, or any successor in interest to such a person.
    (5) Published means distribution of copies of a work to the public 
by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. 
The offering to distribute copies to a group of persons for purposes of 
further distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes 
publication. A public performance or display of a work does not of 
itself constitute publication.
    (c) Forms. The Copyright Office does not provide Statement of Intent 
forms for the use of potential copyright owners who want to restore 
copyright protection in eligible works.
    (d) Requirements for effective Statements of Intent. (1) The 
document should be clearly designated as a ``Statement of Intent to 
restore copyright protection in the United States in accordance with the 
North American Free Trade Agreement''.
    (2) Statements of Intent must include:
    (i) The title(s) of the work(s) for which copyright restoration is 
sought, including any underlying work(s) that has a title(s) different 
from the title of the motion picture, provided all works are owned by 
the same potential copyright owner;
    (ii) The nation of first fixation;
    (iii) The nation of first publication;
    (iv) The date of first publication;
    (v) The name and mailing address (and telephone and telefax, if 
applicable) of the potential copyright owner of the work;
    (vi) The following certification (in its entirety); signed and dated 
by the potential copyright owner or authorized agent:

    Certification and Signature: I hereby certify that each of the above 
titled works was first fixed or first published in

________________________________________________________________________

(insert Mexico or Canada) and understand that the work(s) have entered 
the public domain in the United States of America because of first 
publication on or after January 1, 1978, and before March 1, 1989, 
without the notice required by U.S. copyright law. I certify that the 
information given herein is true and correct to the best of my 
knowledge, and understand that any knowing or willful falsification of 
material facts may result in criminal liability under 18 U.S.C. 1001.

Signature:______________________________________________________________

Name (Printed or Typed):________________________________________________

Date:___________________________________________________________________

    (3) If copyright restoration is sought for an underlying work only, 
the Statement of Intent must specify the kind of underlying work covered 
and give the title if different from the title of the motion picture.
    (4) More than one motion picture may be included in a single 
Statement of Intent provided the potential copyright owner is the same 
for all the motion pictures. The information required in Sec. 201.31 
(d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(iv) must be given for each work.
    (5) Sports programs that do not have a title can be identified in a 
Statement of Intent by giving the sporting event, the team names and the 
date (month, day and year).
    (6) Statements of Intent must be received in the Copyright Office on 
or before December 31, 1994.
    (7) Statements of Intent must be in English and either typed or 
legibly printed by hand, on 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch white paper.
    (e) Fee. The Copyright Office is not requiring a fee for the 
processing of Statements of Intent.
    (f) Effective date of restoration of copyright protection. (1) 
Potential copyright owners of eligible works who file a complete and 
timely Statement of Intent with the Copyright

[[Page 482]]

Office will have copyright protection restored in these works effective 
January 1, 1995.
    (2) The new section 17 U.S.C. 104A(c) created by the NAFTA 
Implementation Act gives a one year exemption to U.S. nationals or 
domiciliaries who made or acquired copies of a motion picture or its 
contents before December 8, 1993, the date of enactment of the 
implementing act. These individuals or entities may continue to sell, 
distribute, or perform publicly such works without liability for a 
period of one year following the Copyright Office's publication in the 
Federal Register of the list of the works determined to be properly 
qualified for protection and for which complete and timely Statements of 
Intent have been filed.
    (g) Registration of works whose copyright has been restored. After 
January 1, 1995, the Copyright Office encourages potential copyright 
owners to make voluntary copyright registration in accordance with 17 
U.S.C. 408 for works that have had copyright restored in accordance with 
NAFTA.

    (a) General. This section prescribes the procedures for submission 
of corrections of Notices of Intent to Enforce a Copyright (NIEs) 
Restored under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of December 8, 1994, as 
required by 17 U.S.C. 104A(e), as amended by Pub. L. 103-465, 108 Stat. 
4809, 4976 (1994).
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply.
    (1) Major error. A major error in filing a Notice of Intent to 
Enforce a Copyright Restored under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act is 
an error in the name of the copyright owner or rightholder, or in the 
title of the work (as opposed to its translation, if any) where such 
error fails to adequately identify the restored work or its owner 
through a reasonable search of the Copyright Office NIE records. 
Omission of, or incorrect information regarding, a written agency 
relationship also constitutes a major error.
    (2) Minor error. A minor error in filing a Notice of Intent to 
Enforce a Copyright Restored under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act is 
any error that is not a major error.
    (3) Restored work. For the definition of works restored under the 
URAA, see 37 CFR 201.33.
    (c) Forms. The Copyright Office does not provide forms for 
Correction Notices of Intent to Enforce filed with the Copyright Office. 
It requests that filers of such Correction NIEs follow the format set 
out in Appendix A of this section and give all information listed in 
paragraph (d) of this section. Correction NIEs must be in English, and 
should be typed or legibly printed by hand in dark, preferably black 
ink, on 8\1/2\<gr-thn-eq> by 11<gr-thn-eq> white paper of good quality 
with at least a 1<gr-thn-eq> (or three cm) margin.
    (d) Requirements for Correction Notice of Intent to Enforce a 
Copyright Restored under the Uruguay Round Agreements

[[Page 486]]

Act. (1) A correction for a Notice of Intent to Enforce should be 
clearly designated as a ``Correction Notice of Intent to Enforce'' or 
``Correction NIE.''
    (2) Correction Notices of Intent to Enforce should be sent to the 
following address: URAA/GATT, NIEs and Registrations, PO Box 70400,

previous NIE;
    (v) A statement of the correct information as it should have 
appeared and an optional explanation of its correction; or

    (A) To which correspondence concerning the document should be sent; 
and
    (B) To which the acknowledgment of the recordation of the Correction

    (A) A statement that, for each of the works named above, the person 
signing the Correction NIE is the copyright owner, or the owner of an 
exclusive right, or the owner's authorized agent, and that the 
information is correct to the best of that person's knowledge;
    (B) The typed or printed name of the person whose signature appears;
    (C) The signature and date of signature; and
    (D) The telephone and telefax number at which the owner, 
rightholder, or agent thereof can be reached.
    (4) A Correction NIE may cover multiple works in multiple NIE 
documents for one fee provided that: each work is identified by title; 
all the works are by the same author; all the works are owned by the 
same copyright owner or owner of an exclusive right. In the case of 
Correction NIEs, the notice must separately designate each title to be 
corrected, noting the incorrect information as it appeared on the 
previously filed NIE, as well as the corrected information. A single 
notice covering multiple titles need bear only a single certification.
    (5) Copies, phonorecords or supporting documents cannot be made part 
of the record of a Correction NIE and should not be submitted with the 
document.
    (6) Time for submitting Correction NIEs. (i) Major errors. The 
Copyright Office will accept a Correction NIE for a major error 
concerning a restored work during the 24-month period beginning on the

of title 17.
    (e) Fee--(1) Amount. The filing fee for recording Correction NIEs is 
30 U.S. dollars for each Correction Notice covering one work. For single

author and owned by the same copyright owner or owner of an exclusive 
right, the fee is 30 U.S. dollars, plus one dollar for each additional 
work covered beyond the first designated work.
    (2) Method of payment. See 37 CFR 201.33(e)(1),(2).
    (f) Public online access. Information contained in the Correction

fees against the balance in their accounts instead of sending separate 
remittances with each request for service. For information on Deposit 
Accounts, visit the Copyright Office website or write: Copyright Office,

Sec. 201.40  Exemption to prohibition against circumvention.

    (a) General. This section prescribes the classes of copyrighted 
works for which the Librarian of Congress has determined, pursuant to 17 
U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)(C) and (D), that noninfringing uses by persons who are 
users of such works are, or are likely to be, adversely affected. The 
prohibition against circumvention of technological measures that control 
access to copyrighted works set forth in 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)(A) shall 
not apply to such users of the prescribed classes of copyrighted works.
    (b) Classes of copyrighted works. Pursuant to the authority set 
forth in 17

[[Page 495]]

U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)(C) and (D), and upon the recommendation of the 
Register of copyrights, the Librarian has determined that two classes of 
copyrighted works shall be subject to the exemption found in 17 U.S.C. 
1201(a)(1)(B) from the prohibition against circumvention of 
technological measures that effectively control access to copyrighted 
works set forth in 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)A) for the period from October 
28, 2000 to October 28, 2003. The exempted classes of works are:
    (1) Compilations consisting of lists of websites blocked by 
filtering software applications; and
    (2) Literary works, including computer programs and databases, 
protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit access 
because of malfunction, damage or obsoleteness.

Sec. 202.1  Material not subject to copyright.

    The following are examples of works not subject to copyright and 
applications for registration of such works cannot be entertained:
    (a) Words and short phrases such as names, titles, and slogans; 
familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic 
ornamentation, lettering or coloring; mere listing of ingredients or 
contents;
    (b) Ideas, plans, methods, systems, or devices, as distinguished 
from the particular manner in which they are expressed or described in a 
writing;
    (c) Blank forms, such as time cards, graph paper, account books, 
diaries, bank checks, scorecards, address books, report forms, order 
forms and the like, which are designed for recording information and do 
not in themselves convey information;
    (d) Works consisting entirely of information that is common property 
containing no original authorship, such as, for example: Standard 
calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, schedules 
of sporting events, and lists or tables taken from public documents or 
other common sources.
    (e) Typeface as typeface.

<R05>
Sec. 202.2  Copyright notice.

    (a) General. (1) With respect to a work published before January 1, 
1978, copyright was secured, or the right to secure it was lost, except 
for works seeking ad interim copyright, at the date of publication, 
i.e., the date on which copies are first placed on sale, sold, or 
publicly distributed, depending upon the adequacy of the notice of 
copyright on the work at that time. The adequacy of the copyright notice 
for such a work is determined by the copyright statute as it existed on 
the date of first publication.
    (2) If before January 1, 1978, publication occurred by distribution 
of copies or in some other manner, without the statutory notice or with 
an inadequate notice, as determined by the copyright statute as it 
existed on the date of first

[[Page 496]]

publication, the right to secure copyright was lost. In such cases, 
copyright cannot be secured by adding the notice to copies distributed 
at a later date.
    (3) Works first published abroad before January 1, 1978, other than 
works for which ad interim copyright has been obtained, must have borne 
an adequate copyright notice. The adequacy of the copyright notice for 
such works is determined by the copyright statute as it existed on the 
date of first publication abroad.
    (b) Defects in notice. Where the copyright notice on a work 
published before January 1, 1978, does not meet the requirements of 
title 17 of the United States Code as it existed on December 31, 1977, 
the Copyright Office will reject an application for copyright 
registration. Common defects in the notice include, among others the 
following:
    (1) The notice lacks one or more of the necessary elements (i.e., 
the word ``Copyright,'' the abbreviation ``Copr.'', or the symbol 
[copy], or, in the case of a sound recording, the symbol [copy]; the 
name of the copyright proprietor, or, in the case of a sound recording, 
the name, a recognizable abbreviation of the name, or a generally known 
alternative designation, of the copyright owner; and, when required, the 
year date of publication);
    (2) The elements of the notice are so dispersed that a necessary 
element is not identified as a part of the notice; in the case of a 
sound recording, however, if the producer is named on the label or 
container, and if no other name appears in conjunction with the notice, 
his name will be considered a part of the notice;
    (3) The notice is not in one of the positions prescribed by law;
    (4) The notice is in a foreign language;
    (5) The name in the notice is that of someone who had no authority 
to secure copyright in his name;
    (6) The year date in the copyright notice is later than the date of 
the year in which copyright was actually secured, including the 
following cases:
    (i) Where the year date in the notice is later than the date of 
actual publication;
    (ii) Where copyright was first secured by registration of a work in 
unpublished form, and copies of the same work as later published without 
change in substance bear a copyright notice containing a year date later 
than the year of unpublished registration;
    (iii) Where a book or periodical published abroad, for which ad 
interim copyright has been obtained, is later published in the United 
States without change in substance and contains a year date in the 
copyright notice later than the year of first publication abroad:

Provided, however, That in each of the three foregoing types of cases, 
if the copyright was actually secured not more than one year earlier 
than the year date in the notice, registration may be considered as a 
doubtful case.
    (7) A notice is permanently covered so that it cannot be seen 
without tearing the work apart;
    (8) A notice is illegible or so small that it cannot be read without 
the aid of a magnifying glass: Provided, however, That where the work 
itself requires magnification for its ordinary use (e.g., a microfilm, 
microcard or motion picture) a notice which will be readable when so 
magnified, will not constitute a reason for rejection of the claim;
    (9) A notice is on a detachable tag and will eventually be detached 
and discarded when the work is put in use;
    (10) A notice is on the wrapper or container which is not a part of 
the work and which will eventually be removed and discarded when the 
work is put to use; the notice may be on a container which is designed 
and can be expected to remain with the work;
    (11) The notice is restricted or limited exclusively to an 
uncopyrightable element, either by virtue of its position on the work, 
by the use of asterisks, or by other means.

Sec. 202.3  Registration of copyright.

    (a) General. (1) This section prescribes conditions for the 
registration of copyright, and the application to be made for 
registration under sections 408 and

[[Page 497]]

409 of title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553.
    (2) For the purposes of this section, the terms audiovisual work, 
compilation, copy, derivative work, device, fixation, literary work, 
motion picture, phonorecord, pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, 
process, sound recording, and their variant forms, have the meanings set 
forth in section 101 of title 17. The term author includes an employer 
or other person for whom a work is ``made for hire'' under section 101 
of title 17.
    (3) For the purposes of this section, a copyright claimant is 
either:
    (i) The author of a work;
    (ii) A person or organization that has obtained ownership of all 
rights under the copyright initially belonging to the author.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ This category includes a person or organization that has 
obtained, from the author or from an entity that has obtained ownership 
of all rights under the copyright initially belonging to the author, the 
contractual right to claim legal title to the copyright in an 
application for copyright registration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Administrative classification and application forms--(1) Classes 
of works. For the purpose of registration, the Register of Copyrights 
has prescribed the classes of works in which copyright may be claimed. 
These classes, and examples of works which they include, are as follows:
    (i) Class TX: Nondramatic literary works. This class includes all 
published and unpublished nondramatic literary works. Examples: Fiction; 
nonfiction; poetry; textbooks; reference works; directories; catalogs; 
advertising copy; and compilations of information.
    (ii) Class PA: Works of the performing arts. This class includes all 
published and unpublished works prepared for the purpose of being 
performed directly before an audience or indirectly by means of a device 
or process. Examples: Musical works, including any accompanying words; 
dramatic works, including any accompanying music; pantomimes and 
choreographic works; and motion pictures and other audiovisual works.
    (iii) Class VA: Works of the visual arts. This class includes all 
published and unpublished pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works. 
Examples: Two dimensional and three dimensional works of the fine, 
graphic, and applied arts; photographs; prints and art reproductions; 
maps, globes, and charts; technical drawings, diagrams, and models; and 
pictorial or graphic labels and advertisements.
    (iv) Class SR: Sound recordings. This class includes all published 
and unpublished sound recordings fixed on and after February 15, 1972. 
Claims to copyright in literary, dramatic, and musical works embodied in 
phonorecords may also be registered in this class under paragraph (b)(3) 
of this section if:
    (A) Registration is sought on the same application for both a 
recorded literary, dramatic, or musical work and a sound recording;
    (B) The recorded literary, dramatic, or musical work and the sound 
recording are embodied in the same phonorecord; and
    (C) The same claimant is seeking registration of both the recorded 
literary, dramatic, or musical work and the sound recording.
    (v) Class SE: Serials. A serial is a work issued or intended to be 
issued in successive parts bearing numerical or chronological 
designations and intended to be continued indefinitely. This class 
includes periodicals; newspapers; annuals; and the journals, 
proceedings, transactions, etc. of societies.
    (2) Application forms. For the purpose of registration, The Register 
of Copyrights has prescribed the basic forms to be used for all 
applications submitted on and after January 1, 1978. Each form 
corresponds to a class set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and 
is so designated (``Form TX''; ``Form PA''; ``Form VA''; ``Form SR''; 
``Form SE''; and ``Form SE/Group''). Copies of the forms are available 
free upon request to the Public Information Office, Library of Congress, 
Copyright Office, 101 Independence Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20559-
6000. Applications should be submitted in the class most appropriate to 
the nature of the authorship in which copyright is claimed. In the case 
of contributions to collective works, applications should be submitted 
in the class representing the copyrightable authorship in the 
contribution. In the case of derivative works, applications should be 
submitted in the class most appropriately

[[Page 498]]

representing the copyrightable authorship involved in recasting, 
transforming, adapting, or otherwise modifying the preexisting work. In 
cases where a work contains elements of authorship in which copyright is 
claimed which fall into two or more classes, the application should be 
submitted in the class most appropriate to the type of authorship that 
predominates in the work as a whole. However, in any case where 
registration is sought for a work consisting of or including a sound 
recording in which copyright is claimed \2\ the application shall be 
submitted on Form SR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ A sound recording does not include the sounds accompanying a 
motion picture or other audiovisual work (17 U.S.C. 101). For this 
purpose, ``accompanying'' does not require physical integration in the 
same copy. Accordingly, registration may be made for a motion picture or 
audiovisual kit in Class PA and that registration will cover the sounds 
embodied in the ``sound track'' of the motion picture or on disks, 
tapes, or the like included in the kit. Separate application in Class SR 
is not appropriate for these elements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Registration as a single work. (i) For the purpose of 
registration on a single application and upon payment of a single 
registration fee, the following shall be considered a single work:
    (A) In the case of published works: all copyrightable elements that 
are otherwise recognizable as self-contained works, that are included in 
a single unit of publication, and in which the copyright claimant is the 
same; and
    (B) In the case of unpublished works: all copyrightable elements 
that are otherwise recognizable as self-contained works, and are 
combined in a single unpublished ``collection.'' For these purposes, a 
combination of such elements shall be considered a ``collection'' if:
    (1) The elements are assembled in an orderly form;
    (2) The combined elements bear a single title identifying the 
collection as a whole;
    (3) The copyright claimant in all of the elements, and in the 
collection as a whole, is the same; and
    (4) All of the elements are by the same author, or, if they are by 
different authors, at least one of the authors has contributed 
copyrightable authorship to each element.

Registration of an unpublished ``collection'' extends to each 
copyrightable element in the collection and to the authorship, if any, 
involved in selecting and assembling the collection.
    (ii) In the case of applications for registration made under 
paragraphs (b)(3) through (b)(8) of this section, the ``year in which 
creation of this work was completed'', as called for by the application, 
means the latest year in which the creation of any copyrightable element 
was completed.
    (4) Group registration of related works: Automated databases. (i) 
Pursuant to the authority granted by section 408(c)(1) of title 17 of 
the United States Code, the Register of Copyrights has determined that, 
on the basis of a single application, deposit, and filing fee, a single 
registration may be made for automated databases and their updates or 
other derivative versions that are original works of authorship, if, 
where a database (or updates or other revisions thereof), if 
unpublished, is (or are) fixed, or if published is (or are) published 
only in the form of machine-readable copies, all of the following 
conditions are met:
    (A) All of the updates or other revisions are owned by the same 
copyright claimant;
    (B) All of the updates or other revisions have the same general 
title;
    (C) All of the updates or other revisions are similar in their 
general content, including their subject;
    (D) All of the updates or other revisions are similar in their 
organization;
    (E) Each of the updates or other revisions as a whole, if published 
before March 1, 1989, bears a statutory copyright notice as first 
published and the name of the owner of copyright in each work (or an 
abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known 
alternative designation of the owner) was the same in each notice;
    (F) Each of the updates or other revisions if published was first 
published, or if unpublished was first created, within a three-month 
period in a single calendar year; and
    (G) The deposit accompanying the application complies with 
Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(vii)(D).

[[Page 499]]

    (ii) A single registration may be made on one application for both a 
database published on a single date, or if unpublished, created on a 
single date, and also for its copyrightable revisions, including updates 
covering a three-month period in a single calendar year. An application

    (iii) The complimentary subscription copies must be addressed to: 
Group Periodicals Registration, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 
20540-4161.
    (iv) The Register of Copyrights may revoke the privilege of group 
registration of serials for any publisher who fails to submit the 
required complimentary subscription copies promptly after publication of 
each issue. Notice of revocation of the group registration of serials 
privilege shall be given in writing and shall be sent to the individual 
person or organization applying for group registration of serials, at 
the last address shown in the records of the Copyright Office. A notice 
of revocation may be given at any time if the requirements of the 
regulation are not satisfied, but it shall state a specific date of 
revocation that is at least 30 days later than the date the notice is 
mailed.
    (v) To apply for group registration of serials under section 
408(c)(1) of title 17 and this subsection, the following items must be 
sent together in the same package:
    (A) A completed Form SE/Group, giving the requested information.
    (B) The appropriate filing fee, as required in Sec. 201.3(c), for 
each issue covered by the group registration.
    (C) A deposit consisting of one complete copy of the best edition of 
each issue included in the group registration.
    (6) Group registration of daily newspapers. (i) Pursuant to the 
authority granted by 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(1), the Register of Copyrights has 
determined that, on the basis of a single application, microfilm 
deposit, and filing fee, a single registration may be made for a group 
of daily newspapers published in a microfilm format if the following 
conditions are met:
    (A) Registration covers a full month of issues of the same newspaper 
title published with issue dates in one calendar month.

meeting the Library's best edition criteria that includes all issues 
published as final editions in the designated calendar month. In 
addition to the final edition of the daily newspaper, the claim to 
copyright and the deposit may also include earlier editions published 
the same day in a given metropolitan area served by the newspaper, but 
may not include national or regional editions distributed beyond a given 
metropolitan area.
    (E) The appropriate filing fee, as required in Sec. 201.3(c), is 
included with the submission or charged to an active deposit account.
    (F) Registration is sought within three months after the publication

    (ii) As used in this regulation, newspapers means serials which are 
classified as newspapers under the policy document ``Newspapers Received 
Currently in the Library of Congress,''which is administered by the 
Newspaper Section of the Serials & Government Publications Division of 
the Library of Congress. In general, serials classified as newspapers 
are serials mainly designed to be a primary source of written 
information on current events, either local, national, or international 
in scope. A newspaper contains a broad range of news on all subjects and 
activities and is not limited to any specific subject matter. Newspapers 
are intended either for the general public or for a particular ethnic, 
cultural, or national group.
    (7) Group registration of contributions to periodicals. (i) As 
provided by section 408(c)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code, as 
amended by Pub. L. 94-553, a single registration, on the basis of a 
single application, deposit, and registration fee, may be made for a 
group of works if all of the following conditions are met:
    (A) All of the works are by the same author;
    (B) The author of each work is an individual, and not an employer or 
other person for whom the work was made for hire;
    (C) Each of the works was first published as a contribution to a 
periodical (including newspapers) within a twelve-month period;\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ This does not require that each of the works must have been 
first published during the same calendar year; it does require that, to 
be grouped in a single application, the earliest and latest 
contributions must not have been first published more than twelve months 
apart.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (D) Each of the works, if first published before March 1, 1989, bore 
a separate copyright notice, and the name of the owner of copyright in 
each work (or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a 
generally known alternative designation of the owner) was the same in 
each notice; and
    (E) The deposit accompanying the application must consist of one of 
the following: one copy of the entire issue of the periodical, or, in 
the case of a newspaper, the entire section containing the contribution; 
tear sheets or proof copies of the contribution; a photocopy of the 
contribution itself, or a photocopy of the entire page containing the 
contribution; the entire page containing the contribution cut or torn 
from the collective work; the contribution cut or torn from the 
collective work; or photographs or photographic slides of the 
contribution or entire page containing the contribution as long as all 
contents of the contribution to be registered are clear and legible.
    (ii) An application for group registration under section 408(c)(2) 
of title 17 and paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall consist of:
    (A) A basic application for registration on Form TX, Form PA, or 
Form VA, \4\ which shall contain the information required by the form 
and its accompanying instructions;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ The basic application should be filed in the class appropriate 
to the nature of authorship in the majority of the contributions. 
However, if any of the contributions consists preponderantly of 
nondramatic literary material that is in the English language, the basic 
application for the entire group should be submitted on Form TX.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) An adjunct form prescribed by the Copyright Office and 
designated ``Adjunct Application for Copyright Registration for a Group 
of Contributions to Periodicals (Form GR/CP)'',

[[Page 501]]

which shall contain the information required by the form and its 
accompanying instructions; and
    (C) The appropriate filing fee, as required in Sec. 201.3(c), and 
the deposit required by paragraph (b)(7)(i)(E) of this section.
    (8) Group registration of daily newsletters. Pursuant to the 
authority granted by 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(1), the Register of Copyrights has 
determined that, on the basis of a single application, deposit, and 
filing fee, a single registration may be made for a group of two or more 
issues of a daily newsletter if the following conditions are met:
    (i) As used in this regulation, daily newsletter means a serial 
published and distributed by mail or electronic media (online or 
telefacsimile), or in any medium including but not limited to, paper, 
cassette tape, diskette or CD-ROM. Publication must occur on at least 
two days each week and the newsletter must contain news or information 
of interest chiefly to a special group (for example, trade and 
professional associations, corporate in-house groups, schools, colleges, 
or churches).
    (ii) The works must be essentially all new collective works or all 
new issues that have not been published before.
    (iii) Each issue must be a work made for hire.
    (iv) The author(s) and claimant(s) must be the same person(s) or 
organization(s) for all of the issues.
    (v) All the items in the group must bear issue dates within a single 
calendar month under the same continuing title.
    (vi) Deposit. (A). The deposit for newsletters registered under this 
section is one complete copy of each issue included in the group.
    (B). In addition, if requested in writing by the Copyright 
Acquisitions Division before an application for registration is 
submitted, the claimant must give the Library of Congress whichever of 
the following the Library prefers: either as many as two complimentary 
subscriptions of the newsletter in the edition most suitable to the 
Library's needs, or a single positive, 35 mm silver halide microfilm 
meeting the Library's best edition criteria that includes all issues 
published as final editions in the designated calendar month. 
Subscription copies must be delivered to the separate address specified 
by the Copyright Acquisitions Division in its request. Subscription 
copies or a microfilm are not required unless expressly requested by the 
Copyright Acquisitions Division.
    (C) The copyright owner of any newsletter that cannot meet the 
criteria set out in this section may continue to register on Form SE or 
Short Form SE.
    (vii) Registration is sought within three months after the 
publication date of the last issue included in the group.
    (viii) A Form G/DN shall be submitted for daily newsletters bearing 
issue dates within a single month, together with one copy of each issue, 
and a filing fee. The application shall designate the first and last day 
that issues in the group were published.
    (9) Group registration of published photographs. Pursuant to the 
authority granted by 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(1), the Register of Copyrights 
will accept a single application (on Form VA), deposit and filing fee 
for registration of a group of photographs if the following conditions 
are met:
    (i) The copyright claimant in all of the photographs must be the 
same.
    (ii) The photographer who photographed each of the photographs 
submitted for registration as part of the group must be the same person.
    (iii) The photographs in the group must have been published within 
the same calendar year.
    (iv) If the photographs in a group were all published on the same 
date, the date of publication must be identified in space 3b of the 
application. If the photographs in a group were not all published on the 
same date, the range of dates of publication (e.g., January 1-December 
31, 2001) must be provided in space 3b of the application, and the date 
of publication of each photograph within the group must be identified 
either on the deposited image or on a continuation sheet, in such a 
manner that for each photograph in the group, the date of publication 
can be identified. A special continuation sheet for registration of a 
group of photographs

[[Page 502]]

shall be made available by the Copyright Office.
    (v) If each photograph within the group was first published within 
three months before the date on which an acceptable application, an 
acceptable deposit, and the applicable fee are received in the Copyright 
Office, the applicant may, in lieu of the procedure set forth in 
paragraph (b)(9)(iv) of this section, simply state the range of dates of 
publication (e.g., February 15-May 15, 2001) in space 3b of the 
application, without specifically identifying the date of publication of 
each photograph in the group either on the deposited image or on a 
continuation sheet.
    (vi) The deposit(s) and application must be accompanied by the fee 
set forth in Sec. 201.3(c) of this chapter for a basic registration.
    (vii) The applicant must state ``Group Registration/Photos'' and 
state the approximate number of photographs included in the group in 
space 1 of the application Form VA under the heading ``Previous or 
Alternative Titles'' (e.g., ``Group Registration/Photos; app. 450 
photographs'').
    (viii) If the photographs in the group are works made for hire, the 
applicant must note, as part of the applicant's entry in space 2 of the 
application Form VA for ``Name of Author,'' both the name of the 
employer for hire and the name of the photographer who photographed the 
works in the group (e.g., ``XYZ Corporation, employer for hire of John 
Doe'').
    (ix) As an alternative to the best edition of the work, one copy of 
each photograph shall be submitted in one of the formats set forth in 
Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(xx).
    (10) One registration per work. As a general rule only one copyright 
registration can be made for the same version of a particular work. 
However:
    (i) Where a work has been registered as unpublished, another 
registration may be made for the first published edition of the work, 
even if it does not represent a new version;
    (ii) Where someone other than the author is identified as copyright 
claimant in a registration, another registration for the same version 
may be made by the author in his or her own name as copyright 
claimant;\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ An author includes an employer or other person for whom a work 
is ``made for hire'' under 17 U.S.C. 101. This paragraph does not permit 
an employee or other person working ``for hire'' under that section to 
make a later registration in his or her own name. In the case of authors 
of a joint work, this paragraph does permit a later registration by one 
author in his or her own name as copyright claimant, where an earlier 
registration identifies only another author as claimant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iii) Where an applicant for registration alleges that an earlier 
registration for the same version is unauthorized and legally invalid, a 
registration may be made by that applicant; and
    (iv) Supplementary registrations may be made, under the conditions 
of Sec. 201.5 of these regulations, to correct or amplify the 
information in a registration made under this section.
    (c) Application for registration. (1) An application for copyright 
registration may be submitted by any author or other copyright claimant 
of a work, or the owner of any exclusive right in a work, or the duly 
authorized agent of any such author, other claimant, or owner.
    (2) An application for copyright registration shall be submitted on 
the appropriate form prescribed by the Register of Copyrights under 
paragraph (b) of this section, and shall be accompanied by the 
appropriate filing fee, as required in Sec. 201.3(c), and the deposit 
required under 17 U.S.C. 408 and Sec. 202.20 of these regulations.\6\ 
The application shall contain the information required by the form and 
its accompanying instructions, and shall include a certification. The 
certification shall consist of:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ In the case of applications for group registration of 
newspapers, contributions to periodicals, and newsletters, under 
paragraphs (b)(6), (b)(7), and (b)(8) of this section, the deposits 
shall comply with the deposits specified in the respective paragraphs, 
and the fees with those specified in Sec. 201.3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) A designation of whether the applicant is the author of, or 
other copyright claimant or owner of exclusive rights in, the work, or 
the duly authorized agent of such author, other claimant, or owner 
(whose identity shall also be given);

[[Page 503]]

    (ii) The handwritten signature of such author, other claimant, 
owner, or agent, accompanied by the typed or printed name of that 
person;
    (iii) A declaration that the statements made in the application are 
correct to the best of that person's knowledge; and
    (iv) The date of certification.

An application for registration of a published work will not be accepted 
if the date of certification is earlier than the date of publication 
given in the application.

Sec. 202.4  Effective date of registration.

    The effective date of registration for claims received in the 
Copyright Office on or after January 3, 1991, and through December 31, 
1991, with a short fee of $10 is the date on which the application, 
deposit, and $10 fee have all been received in the Copyright Office, 
provided, the claim is later determined to be acceptable for 
registration by the Register of Copyrights and a supplementary fee of 
$10 is received in the Copyright Office. If the supplementary fee is not 
received promptly after notification of the short fee, the Copyright 
Office will initiate a proceeding to cancel the copyright registration. 
If the supplementary fee of $10 is not received in the Copyright Office 
before the cancellation proceeding is completed, the cancellation will 
become final and will result in the loss of the effective date of 
registration. After cancellation, registration could be obtained only by 
submitting a new application, deposit, and filing fee.

Secs. 202.5-202.9  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 202.10  Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.

    (a) In order to be acceptable as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural 
work, the work must embody some creative authorship in its delineation 
or form. The registrability of such a work is not affected by the 
intention of the author as to the use of the work or the number of 
copies reproduced. The availability of protection or grant of protection 
under the law for a utility or design patent will not affect the 
registrability of a claim in an original work of pictorial, graphic, or 
sculptural authorship.
    (b) A claim to copyright cannot be registered in a print or label 
consisting solely of trademark subject matter and lacking copyrightable 
matter. While the Copyright Office will not investigate whether the 
matter has been or can be registered at the Patent and Trademark Office, 
it will register a properly filed copyright claim in a print or label 
that contains the requisite qualifications for copyright even though 
there is a trademark on it. However, registration of a claim to 
copyright does not give the claimant rights available by trademark 
registrations at the Patent and Trademark Office.

<R05>
Sec. 202.11  Architectural works.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the 
registration of architectural works, as provided for in the amendment of 
title 17 of the United States Code by the Judicial Improvements Act of 
1990, Public Law 101-650.
    (b) Definitions. (1) For the purposes of this section, the term 
architectural work has the same meaning as set forth in section 101 of 
title 17, as amended.
    (2) The term building means humanly habitable structures that are 
intended to be both permanent and stationary, such as houses and office 
buildings, and other permanent and stationary structures designed for 
human occupancy, including but not limited to churches, museums, 
gazebos, and garden pavilions.
    (c) Registration--(1) Original design. In general, an original 
design of a building embodied in any tangible medium of expression, 
including a building, architectural plans, or drawings, may be 
registered as an architectural work.

[[Page 504]]

    (2) Registration limited to single architectural work. For published 
and unpublished architectural works, a single application may cover only 
a single architectural work. A group of architectural works may not be 
registered on a single application form. For works such as tract 
housing, a single work is one house model, with all accompanying floor 
plan options, elevations, and styles that are applicable to that 
particular model.
    (3) Application form. Registration should be sought on Form VA. Line 
one of the form should give the title of the building. The date of 
construction of the building, if any, should also be designated. If the 
building has not yet been constructed, the notation ``not yet 
constructed'' should be given following the title.
    (4) Separate registration for plans. Where dual copyright claims 
exist in technical drawings and the architectural work depicted in the 
drawings, any claims with respect to the technical drawings and 
architectural work must be registered separately.
    (5) Publication. Publication of an architectural work occurs when 
underlying plans or drawings of the building or other copies of the 
building design are distributed or made available to the general public 
by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending. 
Construction of a building does not itself constitute publication for 
purposes of registration, unless multiple copies are constructed.
    (d) Works excluded. The following structures, features, or works 
cannot be registered:
    (1) Structures other than buildings. Structures other than 
buildings, such as bridges, cloverleafs, dams, walkways, tents, 
recreational vehicles, mobile homes, and boats.
    (2) Standard features. Standard configurations of spaces, and 
individual standard features, such as windows, doors, and other staple 
building components.
    (3) Pre-December 1, 1990 building designs. The designs of buildings 
where the plans or drawings of the building were published before 
December 1, 1990, or the buildings were constructed or otherwise 
published before December 1, 1990.

Sec. 202.12  Restored copyrights.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the 
registration of foreign copyright claims which have been restored to 
copyright protection under section 104A of 17 U.S.C., as amended by the 
Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Public Law 103-465.
    (b) Definitions. (1) For the purposes of this section, restored work 
and source country, have the definition given in the URAA and 
Sec. 201.33(b) of this chapter.
    (2) Descriptive statement for a work embodied solely in machine-
readable format is a separate written statement giving the title of the 
work, nature of the work (for example: computer program, database, 
videogame, etc.), plus a brief description of the contents or subject 
matter of the work.
    (c) Registration--(1) General. Application, deposit, and filing fee 
for registering a copyright claim in a restored work under section 104A, 
as amended, may be submitted to the Copyright Office on or after January 
1, 1996. The application, filing fee, and deposit should be sent in a 
single package to the following address: Library of Congress, Copyright 
Office, 101 Independence Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20559-6000.
    (2) GATT forms. Application for registration for single works 
restored to copyright protection under URAA should be made on Form GATT. 
Application for registration for a group of works published under a 
single series title and published within the same calendar year should 
also be made on Form GATT. Application for a group of at least two and 
up to ten individual and related works as described in paragraph 
(c)(5)(ii) of this section should be made on Form GATT/GRP. GATT/URAA 
forms may be obtained by writing or calling the Copyright Office Hotline 
at (202) 707-9100. In addition, legible photocopies of these forms are 
acceptable if reproduced on good quality, 8\1/2\ by 11 inch white paper, 
and printed head to head so that page two is printed on the back of page 
one.

[[Page 505]]

    (3) Fee--(i) Amount. The filing fee for registering a copyright 
claim in a restored work is 30 U.S. dollars. The filing fee for 
registering a group of multiple episodes under a series title under 
paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section is also $30. The filing fee for 
registering a group of related works under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this 
section is 10 U.S. dollars per individual work, with a minimum fee of US 
$30.
    (ii) Method of payment--(A) Checks, money orders, or bank drafts.

redeemable without service or exchange fees through a United States 
institution, must be payable in United States dollars, and must be 
imprinted with American Banking Association routing numbers. In 
addition, international money orders, and postal money orders that are 
negotiable only at a post office are not acceptable. CURRENCY WILL NOT 
BE ACCEPTED.
    (B) Copyright Office Deposit Account. The Copyright Office maintains 
a system of Deposit Accounts for the convenience of those who frequently 
use its services. The system allows an individual or firm to establish a 
Deposit Account in the Copyright Office and to make advance deposits 
into that account. Deposit Account holders can charge copyright fees 
against the balance in their accounts instead of sending separate 
remittances with each request for service. For information on Deposit 
Accounts please write: Register of Copyrights, Copyright Office, Library 
of Congress, Washington, DC 20559, and request a copy of Circular 5, 
``How to Open and Maintain a Deposit Account in the Copyright Office.''
    (C) Credit cards. For URAA registrations the Copyright Office will 
accept VISA, MasterCard, and American Express. Debit cards cannot be 
accepted for payment. With the registration application, an applicant 
using a credit card must submit a separate cover letter stating the name 
of the credit card, the credit card number, the expiration date of the 
credit card, the total amount authorized and a signature authorizing the 
Office to charge the fees to the account. To protect the security of the 
credit card number, the applicant must not write the credit card number 
on the registration application.
    (4) Deposit--(i) General. The deposit for a work registered as a 
restored work under the amended section 104A, except for those works 
listed in paragraphs (c)(4) (ii) through (iv) of this section, should 
consist of one copy or phonorecord which best represents the 
copyrightable content of the restored work. In descending order of 
preference, the deposit should be:
    (A) The work as first published;
    (B) A reprint or re-release of the work as first published;
    (C) A photocopy or identical reproduction of the work as first 
published; or
    (D) A revised version which includes a substantial amount of the 
copyrightable content of the restored work with an indication in writing 
of the percentage of the restored work appearing in the revision.
    (ii) Previously registered works. No deposit is needed for works 
previously registered in the Copyright Office.
    (iii) Works embodied solely in machine-readable format. For works 
embodied only in machine-readable formats, the deposit requirements are 
as follows:
    (A) One machine-readable copy and a descriptive statement of the 
work; or
    (B) Representative excerpts of the work, such as printouts; or, if 
the claim extends to audiovisual elements in the work, a videotape of 
what appears on the screen.
    (iv) Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works. With the exception of 
3-dimensional works of art, the general deposit preferences specified 
under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section shall govern. For 3-
dimensional works of art, the preferred deposit is one or more 
photographs of the work, preferably in color.
    (v) Special relief. An applicant who is unable to submit any of the 
preferred deposits may seek an alternative deposit under special relief 
(37 CFR 202.20(d)). In such a case, the applicant should indicate in 
writing why the deposit preferences cannot be met, and submit 
alternative identifying materials clearly showing some portion of

[[Page 506]]

the copyrightable contents of the restored work which is the subject of 
registration.
    (vi) Motion pictures. If the deposit is a film print (16 or 35 mm), 
the applicant should contact the Performing Arts Section of the 
Examining Division for delivery instructions. The telephone number is: 
(202) 707-6040; the telefax number is: (202) 707-1236.
    (5) Group registration. Copyright claims in more than one restored 
work may be registered as a group in the following circumstances:
    (i) Single series title. Works published under a single series title 
in multiple episodes, installments, or issues during the same calendar 
year may be registered as a group, provided the owner of U.S. rights is 
the same for all episodes, installments, or issues. The Form GATT should 
be used and the number of episodes or installments should be indicated 
in the title line. The filing fee for registering a group of such works 
is $30. In general, the deposit requirements applicable to restored 
works will be applied to the episodes or installments in a similar 
fashion. In the case of a weekly or daily television series, applicants 
should first contact the Performing Arts Section of the Examining 
Division. The telephone number is (202) 707-6040; the telefax number is 
(202) 707-1236.
    (ii) Group of related works. A group of related works may be 
registered on the Form GATT/GRP, provided the following conditions are 
met: the author(s) is the same for all works in the group; the owner of 
all United States rights is the same for all works in the group; all 
works must have been published in the same calendar year; all works fit 
within the same subject matter category, i.e., literary works, musical 
works, motion pictures, etc.; and there are at least two and not more 
than ten individual works in the group submitted. Applicants registering 
a group of related works must file for registration on the Form GATT/
GRP. The filing fee for registering a group of related works is ten 
dollars per individual work, with a minimum fee of $30.
    (d) Works excluded. Works which are not copyrightable subject matter 
under title 17 of the U.S. Code, other than sound recordings fixed 
before February 15, 1972, shall not be registered as restored 
copyrights.

<R05>
Secs. 202.13-202.16  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 202.17  Renewals.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the 
application for renewal copyright under section 304(a) of title 17 of 
the United States Code, as amended by Public Law 102-307 and Pub. L. 
105-298.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term posthumous 
work means a work that was unpublished on the date of the death of the 
author and with respect to which no copyright assignment or other 
contract for exploitation of the work occurred during the author's 
lifetime.
    (c) Renewal registration optional. For works originally copyrighted 
between January 1, 1964 and December 31, 1977 renewal registration is 
optional and not a condition for securing copyright for the new and 
extended sixty-seven year second term. As provided in Public Law 102-
307, 106 Stat. 264 (Act of June 26, 1992), however, renewal of copyright 
by registration during the last year of the original term and renewal 
registration during the sixty-seven year extended term of a copyright 
renewed without registration by operation of Public Law 102-307 differ 
in legal effect. Among other effects, renewal of copyright by 
registration during the last year of the original term vests the renewal 
copyright in the statutory renewal claimant(s) living on the date of 
registration.
    (d) Original term registration. (1) Registration of a claim to 
copyright in the original twenty-eight year term is not a pre-condition 
for making a renewal registration, provided the renewal application is 
accompanied by an Addendum to Form RE and the deposit copy, phonorecord, 
or identifying material specified in paragraph (h) of this section.
    (2) Original term registration can only be made before the 
expiration of the original term of copyright in the work.

[[Page 507]]

    (e) Renewal time limits. (1) For works originally copyrighted 
between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1977, claims to renewal 
copyright may be registered within the last year of the original term, 
which begins on December 31 of the 27th year of the copyright, and runs 
through December 31 of the 28th year of the copyright, or at anytime 
during the extended sixty-seven year second term, if the second term is 
renewed by operation of Public Law 102-307, 106 Stat. 264. The original 
copyright term for a published work is computed from the date of first 
publication; the term for a work originally registered in unpublished 
form is computed from the date of registration in the Copyright Office. 
To vest the renewal copyright by registration, the required renewal 
application, fee, and, if original term registration has not been made, 
the Addendum specified in paragraph (h) of this section must be received 
in the Copyright Office during the prescribed period before the first 
term of copyright expires. The Copyright Office has no discretion to 
extend the renewal time limits for vesting of the renewal copyright by 
registration.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section are subject 
to the following qualification: In order to vest the renewal copyright 
by registration in any case where the year date in the notice on copies 
distributed by authority of the copyright owner is earlier than the year 
of first publication, claims to renewal copyright must be registered 
within the last year of the original copyright term, which begins on 
December 31 of the 27th year from the year contained in the notice, and 
runs through December 31 of the 28th year from the year contained in the 
notice.
    (3) Whenever a renewal applicant has cause to believe that a formal 
application for renewal, which is intended to vest the renewal copyright 
by registration, and any accompanying Addendum relating to subsistence 
of first-term copyright, if sent to the Copyright Office by mail, might 
not be received in the Copyright Office before expiration of the time 
limits provided by 17 U.S.C. 304(a) for vesting of the renewal copyright 
by registration, he or she may apply for renewal registration by 
telegraphic, telefacsimile, or similar written communication. An 
application made by this method will be accepted only if:
    (i) The message is received in the Copyright Office within the 
specified time limits for vesting by registration;
    (ii) The applicant adequately identifies the work involved, the date 
of first publication or original registration, the name and address of 
the renewal claimant, and the statutory basis of the renewal claim;
    (iii) The fee for renewal registration, if not already on deposit, 
is received in the Copyright Office before the time for renewal 
registration has expired; and
    (iv) A formal application for renewal (Form RE) (or a fax copy) and 
in the case of works under paragraph (h) of this section, an 
accompanying Addendum relating to the subsistence of first-term 
copyright are also received in the Copyright Office before April 1 of 
the following year.
    (f) Renewal claimants. (1) Except as otherwise provided by 
paragraphs (f) (2) and (3) of this section, renewal claims may be 
registered only in the name(s) of the eligible person(s) falling within 
one of the following classes of renewal claimants specified in section 
304(a) of the copyright law. If the work was a new version of a previous 
work, renewal may be claimed only in the new matter. If the renewal 
claim is submitted during the last year of the original term of 
copyright, the renewal must be made in the name(s) of the statutory 
claimant(s) entitled to claim the renewal on the date the renewal claim 
is submitted to the Copyright Office for registration. If the renewal 
claim is submitted during the sixty-seven year renewal term, the renewal 
claim can only be registered in the name(s) of the statutory claimant(s) 
entitled to claim the renewal on the last day (December 31st) of the 
original term of copyright.
    (i) In the case of any posthumous work or of any periodical, 
encyclopedia, or other composite work upon which the copyright was 
originally secured by the proprietor thereof, the renewal claim may be 
registered in the name of the proprietor;

[[Page 508]]

    (ii) In the case of any work copyrighted by a corporate body 
(otherwise than as assignees or licensees of the individual author) or 
by an employer for whom such work is made for hire, the renewal claim 
may be registered in the name of the proprietor; and
    (iii) In the case of any other copyrighted work, including a 
contribution by an individual author to a periodical or to a cyclopedic 
or other composite work, the renewal claim may be registered in the 
name(s) of the following person(s) in descending order of eligibility:
    (A) The author of the work, if still living;
    (B) The widow, widower, or children of the author, if the author is 
not living;
    (C) The author's executors, if there is a will and neither the 
author nor any widow, widower, or child of the author is living;
    (D) The author's next of kin, in the absence of a will and if 
neither the author nor any widow, widower, or child of the author is 
living.
    (2) The provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section are subject 
to the following qualification: Notwithstanding the definition of 
``posthumous work'' in paragraph (b) of this section, a renewal claim 
may be registered in the name of the proprietor of the work, as well as 
in the name of the appropriate claimant under paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of 
this section, in any case where a contract for exploitation of the work 
but no copyright assignment in the work has occurred during the author's 
lifetime. However, registration by the Copyright Office in this case 
should not be interpreted as evidencing the validity of the claim.
    (3) The provisions of paragraphs (f)(1)(iii) (C) and (D) of this 
section are subject to the following qualifications:
    (i) In any case where:
    (A)  The author has left a will which names no executor;
    (B)  The author has left a will which names an executor who cannot 
or will not serve in that capacity; or
    (C)  The author has left a will which names an executor who has been 
discharged upon settlement of the estate or removed before the estate 
has been completely administered, the renewal claim may be registered 
either in the name of an administrator cum testamento annexo 
(administrator c.t.a.) or an administrator de bonis non cum testamento 
annexo (administrator d.b.n.c.t.a.) so appointed by a court of competent 
jurisdiction.
    (ii) In any case described in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, 
except in the case where the author has left a will without naming an 
executor and a court appointed administrator c.t.a. or administrator 
d.b.n.c.t.a. is in existence at the time of renewal registration, the 
renewal claim also may be registered in the name of the author's next of 
kin. However, registration by the Copyright Office of the conflicting 
renewal claims in these cases should not be interpreted as evidencing 
the validity of either claim.
    (g) Application for renewal registration. (1) Each application for 
renewal registration shall be submitted on Form RE. Copies of Form RE, 
and if applicable, the Addendum to Form RE, are available free upon 
request to the Public Information Office, United States Copyright 
Office, Library of Congress, Washington, DC 20559.
    (2)(i) An application for renewal registration may be submitted by 
any eligible statutory renewal claimant as specified in paragraph (f) of 
this section or by the duly authorized agent of any such claimant.
    (ii) An application for renewal registration shall be accompanied by 
the appropriate fee, as required in Sec. 201.3(c). The application shall 
contain the information required by the form and its accompanying 
instructions, and shall include a certification. The certification shall 
consist of:
    (A) A designation of whether the applicant is the renewal claimant,

by the typewritten or printed name of that person;
    (C) A declaration that the statements made in the application are 
correct to the best of that person's knowledge; and

    (iii) In the case of an application for renewal registration of a 
work for

[[Page 509]]

which no original registration was made, the application shall be 
accompanied by an Addendum and deposit material in accordance with 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (3) Once a renewal registration has been made, the Copyright Office 
will not accept a duplicate application for renewal registration on 
behalf of the same renewal claimant.
    (h) Addendum for an unregistered work--(1)  Content. If original 
term registration is not timely made for a work, the renewal application 
Form RE must be accompanied by an Addendum to Form RE which must contain 
the following information:
    (i) The title of the work;
    (ii) The name of the author(s);
    (iii) The date of first publication of the work;
    (iv) The place of first publication of the work;
    (v) The citizenship of the author(s) on the date of first 
publication of the work;
    (vi) The domicile of the author(s) on the date of first publication 
of the work;
    (vii) An averment that, at the time of first publication, all the 
copies of the work published under the authority of the author or other 
copyright proprietor bore the copyright notice required by the Copyright 
Act of 1909, title 17 of the United States Code in effect on December 
31, 1977, and that United States copyright subsists in the work; and
    (viii) For works of United States origin which were subject to the 
manufacturing provisions of section 16 of the Copyright Act of 1909 as 
it existed at the time the work was published, the Addendum must also 
contain information about the country of manufacture and the 
manufacturing processes.
    (2) Signature. The Addendum must contain the handwritten signature 
of the renewal claimant or the duly authorized agent of the renewal 
claimant. The signature shall (i) be accompanied by the printed 
typewritten name of the person signing the Addendum and by the date of 
the signature; and (ii) shall be immediately preceded by the following 
printed or typewritten statement in accordance with section 1746 of 
title 28 of the United States Code:

    I certify under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United 
States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.

    (3) Deposit requirement for an unregistered work. In addition to the 
Addendum to Form RE, an application for renewal registration of a work 
for which no original term registration is made must be accompanied by 
one copy or phonorecord or identifying material of the work as first 
published in accordance with the deposit requirements set out in 
Secs. 202.20 and 202.21 of the Copyright Office regulations for basic 
registration.
    (4) Waiver of the deposit requirement. In a case where the renewal 
applicant asserts that it is either physically impossible or otherwise 
an undue hardship to satisfy the deposit requirements of Secs. 202.20 
and 202.21, the Copyright Office, at its discretion, may, upon receipt 
of an acceptable explanation of the inability to submit such copy or

which is sufficient to enable the Copyright Office to examine the work. 
The Examining Division of the Copyright Office may request deposit of 
additional descriptive material if the original submission is 
inadequate.

Sec. 202.18  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 202.19  Deposit of published copies or phonorecords for the Library of Congress.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the deposit 
of copies and phonorecords of published works for the Library of 
Congress under section 407 of title 17 of the United States Code, as 
amended by Pub. L. 94-553. The provisions of this section are not 
applicable to the deposit of copies and phonorecords for purposes of 
copyright registration under section 408 of title 17, except as 
expressly adopted in Sec. 202.20 of these regulations.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1)(i) The best edition of a work is the edition, published in the 
United States at any time before the date of deposit, that the Library 
of Congress determines to be most suitable for its purposes. The ``best 
edition'' requirement is described in detail at Appendix B to this part.
    (ii) Criteria for selection of the ``best edition'' from among two 
or more published editions of the same version of the same work are set 
forth in the statement entitled ``Best Edition of Published Copyrighted 
Works for the Collections of the Library of Congress'' (hereafter 
referred to as the ``Best Edition Statement'') in effect at the time of 
deposit.
    (iii) Where no specific criteria for the selection of the ``best 
edition'' are established in the Best Edition Statement, that edition 
which, in the judgment of the Library of Congress, represents the 
highest quality for its purposes shall be considered the ``best 
edition.'' In such cases:
    (A) When the Copyright Office is aware that two or more editions of 
a work have been published it will consult with other appropriate 
officials of the Library of Congress to obtain instructions as to the 
``best edition'' and (except in cases for which special relief is 
granted) will require deposit of that edition; and
    (B) When a potential depositor is uncertain which of two or more 
published editions comprises the ``best edition'', inquiry should be 
made to the Copyright Acquisitions Division.
    (iv) Where differences between two or more ``editions'' of a work 
represent variations in copyrightable content, each edition is 
considered a separate version, and hence a different work, for the 
purpose of this section, and criteria of ``best edition'' based on such 
differences do not apply.
    (2) A complete copy includes all elements comprising the unit of 
publication of the best edition of the work, including elements that, if 
considered separately, would not be copyrightable subject matter or 
would otherwise be exempt from mandatory deposit requirements under 
paragraph (c) of this section. In the case of sound recordings, a 
``complete'' phonorecord includes the phonorecord, together with any 
printed or other visually perceptible material published with such 
phonorecord (such as textual or pictorial matter appearing on record 
sleeves or album covers, or embodied in leaflets or booklets included in 
a sleeve, album, or other container). In the case of a musical 
composition published in copies only, or in both copies and 
phonorecords:
    (i) If the only publication of copies in the United States took 
place by the rental, lease, or lending of a full score and parts, a full 
score is a ``complete'' copy; and
    (ii) If the only publication of copies in the United States took 
place by the rental, lease, or lending of a conductor's score and parts, 
a conductor's score is a ``complete'' copy.

In the case of a motion picture, a copy is ``complete'' if the 
reproduction of all of the visual and aural elements comprising the 
copyrightable subject matter in the work is clean, undamaged, 
undeteriorated, and free of splices, and if the copy itself and its 
physical housing are free of any defects that would interfere with the 
performance of the work or that would cause mechanical, visual, or 
audible defects or distortions.
    (3) The terms architectural works, copies, collective work, device, 
fixed, literary work, machine, motion picture, phonorecord, publication, 
sound recording, useful article, and their variant forms,

[[Page 511]]

have the meanings given to them in 17 U.S.C. 101.
    (c) Exemptions from deposit requirements. The following categories 
of material are exempt from the deposit requirements of section 407(a) 
of title 17:
    (1) Diagrams and models illustrating scientific or technical works 
or formulating scientific or technical information in linear or three-
dimensional form, such as an architectural or engineering blueprint, 
plan, or design, a mechanical drawing, or an anatomical model.
    (2) Greeting cards, picture postcards, and stationery.
    (3) Lectures, sermons, speeches, and addresses when published 
individually and not as a collection of the works of one or more 
authors.
    (4) Literary, dramatic, and musical works published only as embodied 
in phonorecords. This category does not exempt the owner of copyright, 
or of the exclusive right of publication, in a sound recording resulting 
from the fixation of such works in a phonorecord from the applicable 
deposit requirements for the sound recording.
    (5) Automated databases available only on-line in the United States. 
The exemption does not include the following: automated databases 
distributed in the form of machine-readable copies (such as magnetic 
tape or disks, CD-ROM formats, punch cards, or the like); computerized 
information works in the nature of statistical compendia, serials, and 
reference works; works published in a form requiring the use of a 
machine or device for purposes of optical enlargement (such as film, 
filmstrips, slide films and works published in any variety of 
microform); works published in visually perceptible form but used in 
connection with optical scanning devices; and works reproduced in CD-ROM 
formats.
    (6) Three-dimensional sculptural works, and any works published only 
as reproduced in or on jewelry, dolls, toys, games, plaques, floor 
coverings, wallpaper and similar commercial wall coverings, textiles and 
other fabrics, packaging material, or any useful article. Globes, relief 
models, and similar cartographic representations of area are not within 
this category and are subject to the applicable deposit requirements.
    (7) Prints, labels, and other advertising matter, including 
catalogs, published in connection with the rental lease, lending, 
licensing, or sale of articles of merchandise, works of authorship, or 
services.
    (8) Tests, and answer material for tests when published separately 
from other literary works.
    (9) Works first published as individual contributions to collective 
works. This category does not exempt the owner of copyright, or of the 
exclusive right of publication, in the collective work as a whole, from 
the applicable deposit requirements for the collective work.
    (10) Works first published outside the United States and later 
published in the United States without change in copyrightable content, 
if:
    (i) Registration for the work was made under 17 U.S.C. 408 before 
the work was published in the United States; or
    (ii) Registration for the work was made under 17 U.S.C. 408 after 
the work was published in the United States but before a demand for 
deposit is made under 17 U.S.C. 407(d).
    (11) Works published only as embodied in a soundtrack that is an 
integral part of a motion picture. This category does not exempt the 
owner of copyright, or of the exclusive right of publication, in the 
motion picture, from the applicable deposit requirements for the motion 
picture.
    (12) Motion pictures that consist of television transmission 
programs and that have been published, if at all, only by reason of a 
license or other grant to a nonprofit institution of the right to make a 
fixation of such programs directly from a transmission to the public, 
with or without the right to make further uses of such fixations.
    (d) Nature of required deposit. (1) Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the deposit required to satisfy the 
provisions of section 407(a) of title 17 shall consist of:
    (i) In the case of published works other than sound recordings, two 
complete copies of the best edition; and

[[Page 512]]

    (ii) In the case of published sound recordings, two complete 
phonorecords of the best edition.
    (2) In the case of certain published works not exempt from deposit 
requirements under paragraph (c) of this section, the following special 
provisions shall apply:
    (i) In the case of published three-dimensional cartographic 
representations of area, such as globes and relief models, the deposit 
of one complete copy of the best edition of the work will suffice in 
lieu of the two copies required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) In the case of published motion pictures, the deposit of one 
complete copy of the best edition of the work will suffice in lieu of 
the two copies required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Any deposit 
of a published motion picture must be accompanied by a separate 
description of its contents, such as a continuity, pressbook, or 
synopsis. The Library of Congress may, at its sole discretion, enter 
into an agreement permitting the return of copies of published motion 
pictures to the depositor under certain conditions and establishing 
certain rights and obligations of the Library with respect to such 
copies. In the event of termination of such an agreement by the Library 
it shall not be subject to reinstatement, nor shall the depositor or any 
successor in interest of the depositor be entitled to any similar or 
subsequent agreement with the Library, unless at the sole discretion of 
the Library it would be in the best interests of the Library to 
reinstate the agreement or enter into a new agreement.
    (iii) In the case of any published work deposited in the form of a 
hologram, the deposit shall be accompanied by:
    (A) Two sets of precise instructions for displaying the image fixed 
in the hologram; and
    (B) Two sets of identifying material in compliance with Sec. 202.21 
of these regulations and clearly showing the displayed image.
    (iv) In any case where an individual author is the owner of 
copyright in a published pictorial or graphic work and (A) less than 
five copies of the work have been published, or (B) the work has been 
published and sold or offered for sale in a limited edition consisting 
of no more than three hundred numbered copies, the deposit of one 
complete copy of the best edition of the work or, alternatively, the 
deposit of photographs or other identifying material in compliance with 
Sec. 202.21 of these regulations, will suffice in lieu of the two copies 
required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (v) In the case of a musical composition published in copies only, 
or in both copies and phonorecords, if the only publication of copies in 
the United States took place by rental, lease, or lending, the deposit 
of one complete copy of the best edition will suffice in lieu of the two 
copies required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (vi) In the case of published multimedia kits, that include literary 
works, audiovisual works, sound recordings, or any combination of such 
works, the deposit of one complete copy of the best edition will suffice 
in lieu of the two copies required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (vii) In the case of published computer programs and published 
computerized information works, such as statistical compendia, serials, 
and reference works that are not copy-protected, the deposit of one 
complete copy of the best edition as specified in the current Library of 
Congress Best Edition Statement will suffice in lieu of the two copies 
required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If the works are copy-
protected, two copies of the best edition are required.
    (viii) In the case of published architectural works, the deposit 
shall consist of the most finished form of presentation drawings in the 
following descending order of preference:
    (A) Original format, or best quality form of reproduction, including 
offset or silk screen printing;
    (B) Xerographic or photographic copies on good quality paper;
    (C) Positive photostat or photodirect positive;
    (D) Blue line copies (diazo or ozalid process). If photographs are 
submitted, they should be 8 x 10 inches and should clearly show several 
exterior and interior views. The deposit should disclose

[[Page 513]]

the name(s) of the architect(s) and draftsperson(s) and the building 
site.
    (e) Special relief. (1) In the case of any published work not exempt 
from deposit under paragraph (c) of this section, the Register of 
Copyrights may, after consultation with other appropriate officials of 
the Library of Congress and upon such conditions as the Register may 
determine after such consultation:
    (i) Grant an exemption from the deposit requirements of section 
407(a) of title 17 on an individual basis for single works or series or 
groups of works; or
    (ii) Permit the deposit of one copy or phonorecord, or alternative 
identifying material, in lieu of the two copies or phonorecords required 
by paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or
    (iii) Permit the deposit of incomplete copies or phonorecords, or 
copies or phonorecords other than those normally comprising the best 
edition; or
    (iv) Permit the deposit of identifying material which does not 
comply with Sec. 202.21 of these regulations.
    (2) Any decision as to whether to grant such special relief, and the 
conditions under which special relief is to be granted, shall be made by 
the Register of Copyrights after consultation with other appropriate 
officials of the Library of Congress, and shall be based upon the 
acquisition policies of the Library of Congress then in force.
    (3) Requests for special relief under this paragraph shall be made 
in writing to the Chief, Examining Division, shall be signed by or on 
behalf of the owner of copyright or of the exclusive right of 
publication in the work, and shall set forth specific reasons why the 
request should be granted.
    (4) The Register of Copyrights may, after consultation with other 
appropriate officials of the Library of Congress, terminate any ongoing 
or continuous grant of special relief. Notice of termination shall be 
given in writing and shall be sent to the individual person or 
organization to whom the grant of special relief had been given, at the 
last address shown in the records of the Copyright Office. A notice of 
termination may be given at any time, but it shall state a specific date 
of termination that is at least 30 days later than the date the notice 
is mailed. Termination shall not affect the validity of any deposit made 
earlier under the grant of special relief.
    (f) Submission and receipt of copies and phonorecords. (1) All 
copies and phonorecords deposited in the Copyright Office will be 
considered to be deposited only in compliance with section 407 of title 
17 unless they are accompanied by an application for registration of a 
claim to copyright in the work represented by the deposit, and either a 
registration fee or a deposit account number on the application. Copies 
or phonorecords deposited without such an accompanying application and 
either a fee or a deposit account notation will not be connected with or 
held for receipt of separate applications, and will not satisfy the 
deposit provisions of section 408 of title 17 or Sec. 202.20 of these 
regulations.
    (2) All copies and phonorecords deposited in the Copyright Office 
under section 407 of title 17, unless accompanied by written 
instructions to the contrary, will be considered to be deposited by the 
person or persons named in the copyright notice on the work.
    (3) Upon request by the depositor made at the time of the deposit, 
the Copyright Office will issue a certificate of receipt for the deposit 
of copies or phonorecords of a work under this section. Certificates of 
receipt will be issued in response to requests made after the date of 
deposit only if the requesting party is identified in the records of the 
Copyright Office as having made the deposit. In either case, requests 
for a certificate of receipt must be in writing and accompanied by the 
appropriate fee, as required in Sec. 201.3(c). A certificate of receipt 
will include identification of the depositor, the work deposited, and 
the nature and format of the copy or phonorecord deposited, together 
with the date of receipt.

Sec. 202.20  Deposit of copies and phonorecords for copyright registration.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the deposit 
of copies and phonorecords of published and unpublished works for the 
purpose of copyright registration under section 408 of title 17 of the 
United States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553. The provisions of this 
section are not applicable to the deposit of copies and phonorecords for 
the Library of Congress under section 407 of title 17, except as 
expressly adopted in Sec. 202.19 of these regulations.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    (1) The best edition of a work has the meaning set forth in 
Sec. 202.19(b)(1) of these regulations.
    (2) A complete copy or phonorecord means the following:
    (i) Unpublished works. Subject to the requirements of paragraph 
(b)(2)(vi) of this section, a ``complete'' copy or phonorecord of an 
unpublished work is a copy or phonorecord representing the entire 
copyrightable content of the work for which registration is sought;
    (ii) Published works. Subject to the requirements of paragraphs 
(b)(2) (iii) through (vi) of this section, a ``complete'' copy or 
phonorecord of a published work includes all elements comprising the 
applicable unit of publication of the work, including elements that, if 
considered separately, would not be copyrightable subject matter. 
However, even where certain physically separable elements included in 
the applicable unit of publication are missing from the deposit, a copy 
or phonorecord will be considered ``complete'' for purposes of 
registration where:
    (A) The copy or phonorecord deposited contains all parts of the work 
for which copyright registration is sought; and
    (B) The removal of the missing elements did not physically damage 
the copy or phonorecord or garble its contents; and
    (C) The work is exempt from the mandatory deposit requirements under 
section 407 of title 17 of the United States Code and Sec. 202.19(c) of 
these regulations, or the copy deposited consists entirely of a 
container, wrapper, or holder, such as an envelope, sleeve, jacket, 
slipcase, box, bag, folder, binder, or other receptacle acceptable for 
deposit under paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
    (iii) Contributions to collective works. In the case of a published 
contribution to a collective work, a ``complete'' copy is one complete 
copy of the best edition of the entire collective work, the complete 
section containing the contribution if published in a newspaper, the 
contribution cut from the paper in which it appeared, or a photocopy of 
the contribution itself as it was published in the collective work.
    (iv) Sound recordings. In the case of published sound recordings, a 
``complete'' phonorecord has the meaning set forth in Sec. 202.19(b)(2) 
of these regulations;
    (v) Musical scores. In the case of a musical composition published 
in copies only, or in both copies and phonorecords:
    (A) If the only publication of copies took place by the rental, 
lease, or lending of a full score and parts, a full score is a 
``complete'' copy; and
    (B) If the only publication of copies took place by the rental, 
lease, or lending of a conductor's score and parts, a conductor's score 
is a ``complete'' copy;
    (vi) Motion pictures. In the case of a published or unpublished 
motion picture, a copy is ``complete'' if the reproduction of all of the 
visual and aural elements comprising the copyrightable subject matter in 
the work is clean, undamaged, undeteriorated, and free of splices, and 
if the copy itself and its physical housing are free of any defects that 
would interfere with the performance of the work or that would cause 
mechanical, visual, or audible defects or distortions.
    (3) The terms architectural works, copy, collective work, device, 
fixed, literary work, machine, motion picture, phonorecord, publication, 
sound recording, transmission program, and useful article, and their 
variant forms, have the meanings given to them in 17 U.S.C. 101.
    (4) A secure test is a nonmarketed test administered under 
supervision at specified centers on specific dates, all copies of which 
are accounted for and

[[Page 515]]

either destroyed or returned to restricted locked storage following each 
administration. For these purposes a test is not marketed if copies are 
not sold but it is distributed and used in such a manner that ownership 
and control of copies remain with the test sponsor or publisher.
    (5) Title 17 means title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by 
Pub. L. 94-553.
    (6) For the purposes of determining the applicable deposit 
requirements under this Sec. 202.20 only, the following shall be 
considered as unpublished motion pictures: motion pictures that consist 
of television transmission programs and that have been published, if at 
all, only by reason of a license or other grant to a nonprofit 
institution of the right to make a fixation of such programs directly 
from a transmission to the public, with or without the right to make 
further uses of such fixations.
    (c) Nature of required deposit. (1) Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the deposit required to accompany an 
application for registration of claim to copyright under section 408 of 
title 17 shall consist of:
    (i) In the case of unpublished works, one complete copy or 
phonorecord.
    (ii) In the case of works first published in the United States 
before January 1, 1978, two complete copies or phonorecords of the work 
as first published.
    (iii) In the case of works first published in the United States on 
or after January 1, 1978, two complete copies or phonorecords of the 
best edition.
    (iv) In the case of works first published outside of the United 
States, one complete copy or phonorecord of the work either as first 
published or of the best edition. For purposes of this section, any 
works simultaneously first published within and outside of the United 
States shall be considered to be first published in the United States.
    (2) In the case of certain works, the special provisions set forth 
in this clause shall apply. In any case where this clause specifies that 
one copy or phonorecord may be submitted, that copy or phonorecord shall 
represent the best edition, or the work as first published, as set forth 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (i) General. In the following cases the deposit of one complete copy 
or phonorecord will suffice in lieu of two copies or phonorecords:
    (A) Published three-dimensional cartographic representations of 
area, such as globes and relief models;
    (B) Published diagrams illustrating scientific or technical works or 
formulating scientific or technical information in linear or other two-
dimensional form, such as an architectural or engineering blueprint, or 
a mechanical drawing;
    (C) Published greeting cards, picture postcards, and stationery;
    (D) Lectures, sermons, speeches, and addresses published 
individually and not as a collection of the works of one or more 
authors;
    (E) Musical compositions published in copies only, or in both copies 
and phonorecords, if the only publication of copies took place by 
rental, lease, or lending;
    (F) Published multimedia kits or any part thereof;
    (G) Works exempted from the requirement of depositing identifying 
material under paragraph (c)(2)(xi)(B)(5) of this section;
    (H) Literary, dramatic, and musical works published only as embodied 
in phonorecords, although this category does not exempt the owner of 
copyright in a sound recording;
    (I) Choreographic works, pantomimes, literary, dramatic, and musical 
works published only as embodied in motion pictures;
    (J) Published works in the form of two-dimensional games, decals, 
fabric patches or emblems, calendars, instructions for needle work, 
needle work and craft kits; and
    (K) Works reproduced on three-dimensional containers such as boxes, 
cases, and cartons.
    (ii) Motion pictures. In the case of published or unpublished motion 
pictures, the deposit of one complete copy will suffice. The deposit of 
a copy or copies for any published or unpublished motion picture must be 
accompanied by a separate description of its contents, such as a 
continuity, pressbook,

[[Page 516]]

or synopsis. In any case where the deposit copy or copies required for 
registration of a motion picture cannot be viewed for examining purposes 
on equipment in the Examining Division of the Copyright Office, the 
description accompanying the deposit must comply with Sec. 202.21(h) of 
these regulations. The Library of Congress may, at its sole discretion, 
enter into an agreement permitting the return of copies of published 
motion pictures to the depositor under certain conditions and 
establishing certain rights and obligations of the Library of Congress 
with respect to such copies. In the event of termination of such an 
agreement by the Library, it shall not be subject to reinstatement, nor 
shall the depositor or any successor in interest of the depositor be 
entitled to any similar or subsequent agreement with the Library, unless 
at the sole discretion of the Library it would be in the best interests 
of the Library to reinstate the agreement or enter into a new agreement. 
In the case of unpublished motion pictures (including television 
transmission programs that have been fixed and transmitted to the 
public, but have not been published), the deposit of identifying 
material in compliance with Sec. 202.21 of these regulations may be made 
and will suffice in lieu of an actual copy. In the case of colorized 
versions of motion pictures made from pre-existing black and white 
motion pictures, in addition to the deposit of one complete copy of the 
colorized motion picture and the separate description of its contents as 
specified above, the deposit shall consist of one complete print of the 
black and white version of the motion picture from which the colorized 
version was prepared. If special relief from this requirement is 
requested and granted, the claimant shall make a good faith effort to 
deposit the best available, near-archival quality black and white print, 
as a condition of any grant of special relief.
    (iii) Holograms. In the case of any work deposited in the form of a 
three-dimensional hologram, the copy or copies shall be accompanied by:
    (A) Precise instructions for displaying the image fixed in the 
hologram; and
    (B) Photographs or other identifying material complying with 
Sec. 202.21 of these regulations and clearly showing the displayed 
image.

The number of sets of instructions and identifying material shall be the 
same as the number of copies required. In the case of a work in the form 
of a two-dimensional hologram, the image of which is visible without the 
use of a machine or device, one actual copy of the work shall be 
deposited.
    (iv) Certain pictorial and graphic works. In the case of any 
unpublished pictorial or graphic work, deposit of identifying material 
in compliance with Sec. 202.21 of these regulations may be made and will 
suffice in lieu of deposit of an actual copy. In the case of a published 
pictorial or graphic work, deposit of one complete copy, or of 
identifying material in compliance with Sec. 202.21 of these 
regulations, may be made and will suffice in lieu of deposit of two 
actual copies where an individual author is the owner of copyright, and 
either:
    (A) Less than five copies of the work have been published; or
    (B) The work has been published and sold or offered for sale in a 
limited edition consisting of no more than 300 numbered copies.
    (v) Commercial prints and labels. In the case of prints, labels, and 
other advertising matter, including catalogs, published in connection 
with the rental, lease, lending, licensing, or sale of articles of 
merchandise, works of authorship, or services, the deposit of one 
complete copy will suffice in lieu of two copies. Where the print or 
label is published in a larger work, such as a newspaper or other 
periodical, one copy of the entire page or pages upon which it appears 
may be submitted in lieu of the entire larger work. In the case of 
prints or labels physically inseparable from a three-dimensional object, 
identifying material complying with Sec. 202.21 of these regulations 
must be submitted rather than an actual copy or copies except under the 
conditions of paragraph (c)(2)(xi)(B)(4) of this section.
    (vi) Tests. In the case of tests, and answer material for tests, 
published separately from other literary works, the deposit of one 
complete copy will suffice in lieu of two copies. In the case of

[[Page 517]]

any secure test the Copyright Office will return the deposit to the 
applicant promptly after examination: Provided, That sufficient 
portions, description, or the like are retained so as to constitute a 
sufficient archival record of the deposit.
    (vii) Computer programs and databases embodied in machine-readable 
copies other than CD-ROM format. In cases where a computer program, 
database, compilation, statistical compendium, or the like, if 
unpublished is fixed, or if published is published only in the form of 
machine-readable copies (such as magnetic tape or disks, punched cards, 
semiconductor chip products, or the like) other than a CD-ROM format, 
from which the work cannot ordinarily be perceived except with the aid 
of a machine or device, the deposit shall consist of:
    (A) For published or unpublished computer programs, one copy of 
identifying portions of the program, reproduced in a form visually 
perceptible without the aid of a machine or device, either on paper or 
in microform. For these purposes ``identifying portions'' shall mean one 
of the following:
    (1) The first and last 25 pages or equivalent units of the source 
code if reproduced on paper, or at least the first and last 25 pages or 
equivalent units of the source code if reproduced in microform, together 
with the page or equivalent unit containing the copyright notice, if 
any. If the program is 50 pages or less, the required deposit will be 
the entire source code. In the case of revised versions of computer 
programs, if the revisions occur throughout the entire program, the 
deposit of the page containing the copyright notice and the first and 
last 25 pages of source code will suffice; if the revisions do not occur 
in the first and last 25 pages, the deposit should consist of the page 
containing the copyright notice and any 50 pages of source code 
representative of the revised material; or
    (2) Where the program contains trade secret material, the page or 
equivalent unit containing the copyright notice, if any, plus one of the 
following: the first and last 25 pages or equivalent units of source 
code with portions of the source code containing trade secrets blocked-
out, provided that the blocked-out portions are proportionately less 
than the material remaining, and the deposit reveals an appreciable 
amount of original computer code; or the first and last 10 pages or 
equivalent units of source code alone with no blocked-out portions; or 
the first and last 25 pages of object code, together with any 10 or more 
consecutive pages of source code with no blocked-out portions; or for 
programs consisting of, or less than, 50 pages or equivalent units, 
entire source code with the trade secret portions blocked-out, provided 
that the blocked-out portions are proportionately less than the material 
remaining, and the remaining portion reveals an appreciable amount of 
original computer code. If the copyright claim is in a revision not 
contained in the first and last 25 pages, the deposit shall consist of 
either 20 pages of source code representative of the revised material 
with no blocked-out portions, or any 50 pages of source code 
representative of the revised material with portions of the source code 
containing trade secrets blocked-out, provided that the blocked-out 
portions are proportinately less than the material remaining and the 
deposit reveals an appreciable amount of original computer code. 
Whatever method is used to block out trade secret material, at least an 
appreciable amount of original computer code must remain visible.
    (B) Where registration of a program containing trade secrets is made 
on the basis of an object code deposit the Copyright Office will make 
registration under its rule of doubt and warn that no determination has 
been made concerning the existence of copyrightable authorship.
    (C) Where the application to claim copyright in a computer program 
includes a specific claim in related computer screen displays, the 
deposit, in addition to the identifying portions specified in paragraph 
(c)(2)(vii)(A) of this section, shall consist of:
    (1) Visual reproductions of the copyrightable expression in the form 
of printouts, photographs, or drawings no smaller than 3x3 inches and no 
larger than 9x12 inches; or
    (2) If the authorship in the work is predominantly audiovisual, a 
one-half

[[Page 518]]

inch VHS format videotape reproducing the copyrightable expression, 
except that printouts, photographs, or drawings no smaller than 3x3 
inches and no larger than 9x12 inches must be deposited in lieu of 
videotape where the computer screen material simply constitutes a 
demonstration of the functioning of the computer program.
    (D) For published and unpublished automated databases, compilations, 
statistical compendia, and the like, so fixed or published, one copy of 
identifying portions of the work, reproduced in a form visually 
perceptible without the aid of a machine or device, either on paper or 
in microform. For these purposes:
    (1) Identifying portions shall generally mean either the first and 
last 25 pages or equivalent units of the work if reproduced on paper or 
in microform.
    (2) Datafile and file shall mean a group of data records pertaining 
to a common subject matter regardless of their size or the number of 
data items in them.
    (3) In the case of individual registration of a revised version of 
the works identified in paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(D) of this section, the 
identifying portions deposited shall contain 50 representative pages or 
data records which have been added or modified.
    (4) If the work is an automated database comprising multiple 
separate or distinct data files, ``identifying portions'' shall instead 
consist of 50 complete data records from each data file or the entire 
data file, whichever is less, and the descriptive statement required by 
paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(D)(5) of this section.
    (5) In the case of group registration for revised or updated 
versions of a database, the claimant shall deposit identifying portions 
that contain 50 representative pages or equivalent units, or 
representative data records which have been marked to disclose (or do in 
fact disclose solely) the new material added on one representative 
publication date if published, or on one representative creation date, 
if unpublished, and shall also deposit a brief typed or printed 
descriptive statement containing the notice of copyright information 
required under paragraphs (c)(2)(vii)(D)(6) or (7) of this section, if 
the work bears a notice, and;
    (i) The title of the database;
    (ii) A subtitle, date of creation or publication, or other 
information, to distinguish any separate or distinct data files for 
cataloging purposes;
    (iii) The name and address of the copyright claimant;
    (iv) For each separate file, its name and content, including its 
subject, the origin(s) of the data, and the approximate number of data 
records it contains; and
    (v) In the case of revised or updated versions of an automated 
database, information as to the nature and frequency of changes in the 
database and some identification of the location within the database or 
the separate data files of the revisions.
    (6) For a copyright notice embodied in machine-readable form, the 
statement shall describe exactly the visually perceptible content of the 
notice which appears in or with the database, and the manner and 
frequency with which it is displayed (e.g., at user's terminal only at 
sign-on, or continuously on terminal display, or on printouts, etc.).
    (7) If a visually perceptible copyright notice is placed on any 
copies of the work (or on magnetic tape reels or containers therefor), a 
sample of such notice must also accompany the statement.
    (viii) Machine-readable copies of works other than computer 
programs, databases, and works fixed in a CD-ROM format. Where a 
literary, musical, pictorial, graphic, or audiovisual work, or a sound 
recording, except for works fixed in a CD-ROM format and literary works 
which are computer programs, databases, compilations, statistical 
compendia or the like, if unpublished has been fixed or, if published, 
has been published only in machine-readable form, the deposit must 
consist of identifying material. The type of identifying material 
submitted should generally be appropriate to the type of work embodied 
in machine-readable form, but in all cases should be that which best 
represents the copyrightable content of the work. In all cases the 
identifying material must include the title of the work. A synopsis may

[[Page 519]]

also be requested in addition to the other deposit materials as 
appropriate in the discretion of the Copyright Office. In the case of 
any published work subject to this section, the identifying material 
must include a representation of the copyright notice, if one exists. 
Identifying material requirements for certain types of works are 
specified below. In the case of the types of works listed below, the 
requirements specified shall apply except that, in any case where the 
specific requirements are not appropriate for a given work the form of 
the identifying material required will be determined by the Copyright 
Office in consultation with the applicant, but the Copyright Office will 
make the final determination of the acceptability of the identifying 
material.
    (A) For pictorial or graphic works, the deposit shall consist of 
identifying material in compliance with Sec. 202.21 of these 
regulations;
    (B) For audiovisual works, the deposit shall consist of either a 
videotape of the work depicting representative portions of the 
copyrightable content, or a series of photographs or drawings, depicting 
representative portions of the work, plus in all cases a separate 
synopsis of the work;
    (C) For musical compositions, the deposit shall consist of a 
transcription of the entire work such as a score, or a reproduction of 
the entire work on an audiocassette or other phonorecord;
    (D) For sound recordings, the deposit shall consist of a 
reproduction of the entire work on an audiocassette or other 
phonorecord;
    (E) For literary works, the deposit shall consist of a transcription 
of representative portions of the work including the first and last 25 
pages or equivalent units, and five or more pages indicative of the 
remainder.
    (ix) Copies containing both visually-perceptible and machine-
readable material other than a CD-ROM format. Where a published literary 
work is embodied in copies containing both visually-perceptible and 
machine-readable material, except in the case of a CD-ROM format, the 
deposit shall consist of the visually-perceptible material and 
identifying portions of the machine-readable material.
    (x) Works reproduced in or on sheetlike materials. In the case of 
any unpublished work that is fixed, or any published work that is 
published, only in the form of a two-dimensional reproduction on 
sheetlike materials such as textiles and other fabrics, wallpaper and 
similar commercial wall coverings, carpeting, floor tile, and similar 
commercial floor coverings, and wrapping paper and similar packaging 
material, the deposit shall consist of one copy in the form of an actual 
swatch or piece of such material sufficient to show all elements of the 
work in which copyright is claimed and the copyright notice appearing on 
the work, if any. If the work consists of a repeated pictorial or 
graphic design, the complete design and at least part of one repetition 
must be shown. If the sheetlike material in or on which a published work 
has been reproduced has been embodied in or attached to a three-
dimensional object, such as furniture, or any other three-dimensional 
manufactured article, and the work has been published only in that form, 
the deposit must consist of identifying material complying with 
Sec. 202.21 of these regulations instead of a copy. If the sheet-like 
material in or on which a published work has been reproduced has been 
embodied in or attached to a two-dimensional object such as wearing 
apparel, bed linen, or a similar item, and the work has been published 
only in that form, the deposit must consist of identifying material 
complying with Sec. 202.21 of these regulations instead of a copy unless 
the copy can be folded for storage in a form that does not exceed four 
inches in thickness.
    (xi) Works reproduced in or on three-dimensional objects. (A) In the 
following cases the deposit must consist of identifying material 
complying with Sec. 201.21 of these regulations instead of a copy or 
copies:
    (1) Any three-dimensional sculptural work, including any 
illustration or formulation of artistic expression or information in 
three-dimensional form. Examples of such works include statues, 
carvings, ceramics, moldings, constructions, models, and maquettes; and
    (2) Any two-dimensional or three-dimensional work that, if 
unpublished, has been fixed, or, if published, has

[[Page 520]]

been published only in or on jewelry, dolls, toys, games, except as 
provided in paragraph (c)(2)(xi)(B)(3) of this section, or any three-
dimensional useful article.
    (B) In the following cases the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(2)(xi)(A) of this section for the deposit of identifying material 
shall not apply:
    (1) Three-dimensional cartographic representations of area, such as 
globes and relief models;
    (2) Works that have been fixed or published in or on a useful 
article that comprises one of the elements of the unit of publication of 
an educational or instructional kit which also includes a literary or 
audiovisual work, a sound recording, or any combination of such works;
    (3) Published games consisting of multiple parts that are packaged 
and published in a box or similar container with flat sides and with 
dimensions of no more than 12x24x6 inches;
    (4) Works reproduced on three-dimensional containers or holders such 
as boxes, cases, and cartons, where the container or holder can be 
readily opened out, unfolded, slit at the corners, or in some other way 
made adaptable for flat storage, and the copy, when flattened, does not 
exceed 96 inches in any dimension; or
    (5) Any three-dimensional sculptural work that, if unpublished, has 
been fixed, or, if published, has been published only in the form of 
jewelry cast in base metal which does not exceed four inches in any 
dimension.
    (xii) Soundtracks. For separate registration of an unpublished work 
that is fixed, or a published work that is published, only as embodied 
in a soundtrack that is an integral part of a motion picture, the 
deposit of identifying material in compliance with Sec. 202.21 of these 
regulations will suffice in lieu of an actual copy of the motion 
picture.
    (xiii) Oversize deposits. In any case where the deposit otherwise 
required by this section exceeds 96 inches in any dimension, identifying 
material complying with Sec. 202.21 of these regulations must be 
submitted instead of an actual copy or copies.
    (xiv) Pictorial advertising material. In the case of published 
pictorial advertising material, except for advertising material 
published in connection with motion pictures, the deposit of either one 
copy as published or prepublication material consisting of camera-ready 
copy is acceptable.
    (xv) Contributions to collective works. In the case of published 
contributions to collective works, the deposit of either one complete 
copy of the best edition of the entire collective work, the complete 
section containing the contribution if published in a newspaper, the 
entire page containing the contribution, the contribution cut from the 
paper in which it appeared, or a photocopy of the contribution itself as 
it was published in the collective work, will suffice in lieu of two 
complete copies of the entire collective work.
    (xvi) Phonorecords. In any case where the deposit phonorecord or 
phonorecords submitted for registration of a claim to copyright is 
inaudible on audio playback devices in the Examining Division of the 
Copyright Office, the Office will seek an appropriate deposit in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
    (xvii) Group registration of serials. For group registration of 
related serials, as specified in Sec. 202.3(b)(6), the deposit must 
consist of one complete copy of the best edition of each issue included 
in the group registration. In addition, two complimentary subscriptions 
to any serial for which group registration is sought must be entered and 
maintained in the name of the Library of Congress, and the copies must 
be submitted regularly and promptly after publication.
    (xviii) Architectural works. (A) For designs of unconstructed 
buildings, the deposit must consist of one complete copy of an 
architectural drawing or blueprint in visually perceptible form showing 
the overall form of the building and any interior arrangements of spaces 
and/or design elements in which copyright is claimed. For archival 
purposes, the Copyright Office prefers that the drawing submissions 
consist of the following in descending order of preference:
    (1) Original format, or best quality form of reproduction, including 
offset or silk screen printing;
    (2) Xerographic or photographic copies on good quality paper;

[[Page 521]]

    (3) Positive photostat or photodirect positive;
    (4) Blue line copies (diazo or ozalid process).

The Copyright Office prefers that the deposit disclose the name(s) of 
the architect(s) and draftsperson(s) and the building site, if known.
    (B) For designs of constructed buildings, the deposit must consist 
of one complete copy of an architectural drawing or blueprint in 
visually perceptible form showing the overall form of the building and 
any interior arrangement of spaces and/or design elements in which 
copyright is claimed. In addition, the deposit must also include 
identifying material in the form of photographs complying with 
Sec. 202.21 of these regulations, which clearly discloses the 
architectural works being registered. For archival purposes, the 
Copyright Office prefers that the drawing submissions constitute the 
most finished form of presentation drawings and consist of the following 
in descending order of preference:
    (1) Original format, or best quality form of reproduction, including 
offset or silk screen printing;
    (2) Xerographic or photographic copies on good quality paper;
    (3) Positive photostat or photodirect positive;
    (4) Blue line copies (diazo or ozalid process).

With respect to the accompanying photographs, the Copyright Office 
prefers 8 x 10 inches, good quality photographs, which clearly show 
several exterior and interior views. The Copyright Office prefers that 
the deposit disclose the name(s) of the architect(s) and draftsperson(s) 
and the building site.
    (xix) Works fixed in a CD-ROM format. (A) Where a work is fixed in a 
CD-ROM format, the deposit must consist of one complete copy of the 
entire CD-ROM package, including a complete copy of any accompanying 
operating software and instructional manual, and a printed version of 
the work embodied in the CD-ROM, if the work is fixed in print as well 
as a CD-ROM. A complete copy of a published CD-ROM package includes all 
of the elements comprising the applicable unit of publication, including 
elements that if considered separately would not be copyrightable 
subject matter or could be the subject of a separate registration.
    (B) In any case where the work fixed in a CD-ROM package cannot be 
viewed on equipment available in the Examining Division of the Copyright 
Office, the Office will seek an appropriate deposit in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section, in addition to the deposit of the CD-ROM 
package.
    (xx) Photographs: group registration. For groups of photographs 
registered with one application under Secs. 202.3(b)(3)(i)(B) 
(unpublished collections) or 202.3(b)(9) (group registration of 
published photographs), photographs must be deposited in one of the 
following formats (listed in the Library's order of preference):
    (A) Digital form on one or more CD-ROMs (including CD-RW's) or DVD-
ROMs, in one of the following formats: JPEG, GIF, TIFF, or PCD;
    (B) Unmounted prints measuring at least 3 inches by 3 inches (not to 
exceed 20 inches by 24 inches);
    (C) Contact sheets;
    (D) Slides, each with a single image;
    (E) A format in which the photograph has been published (e.g., 
clippings from newspapers or magazines);
    (F) A photocopy of each of the photographs included in the group, 
clearly depicting the photograph, provided that if registration is made 
pursuant to Sec. 202.3(b)(9) for group registration of photographs, the 
photocopy must be either a photocopy of an unmounted print measuring at 
least 3 inches by 3 inches (not to exceed 20 inches by 24 inches) or a 
photocopy of the photograph in a format in which it has been published, 
and if the photograph was published as a color photograph, the photocopy 
must be a color photocopy;
    (G) Slides, each containing up to 36 images; or
    (H) A videotape clearly depicting each photograph.
    (d) Special relief. (1) In any case the Register of Copyrights may, 
after consultation with other appropriate officials of the Library of 
Congress and upon such conditions as the Register may determine after 
such consultation:
    (i) Permit the deposit of one copy or phonorecord, or alternative 
identifying

[[Page 522]]

material, in lieu of the one or two copies or phonorecords otherwise 
required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section;
    (ii) Permit the deposit of incomplete copies or phonorecords, or 
copies or phonorecords other than those normally comprising the best 
edition; or
    (iii) Permit the deposit of an actual copy or copies, in lieu of the 
identifying material otherwise required by this section; or
    (iv) Permit the deposit of identifying material which does not 
comply with Sec. 202.21 of these regulations.
    (2) Any decision as to whether to grant such special relief, and the 
conditions under which special relief is to be granted, shall be made by 
the Register of Copyrights after consultation with other appropriate 
officials of the Library of Congress, and shall be based upon the 
acquisition policies of the Library of Congress then in force and the 
archival and examining requirements of the Copyright Office.
    (3) Requests for special relief under this paragraph may be combined 
with requests for special relief under Sec. 202.19(e) of these 
regulations. Whether so combined or made solely under this paragraph, 
such requests shall be made in writing to the Chief, Examining Division 
of the Copyright Office, shall be signed by or on behalf of the person 
signing the application for registration, and shall set forth specific 
reasons why the request should be granted.
    (4) The Register of Copyrights may, after consultation with other 
appropriate officials of the Library of Congress, terminate any ongoing 
or continuous grant of special relief. Notice of termination shall be 
given in writing and shall be sent to the individual person or 
organization to whom the grant of special relief had been given, at the 
last address shown in the records of the Copyright Office. A notice of 
termination may be given at any time, but it shall state a specific date 
of termination that is at least 30 days later than the date the notice 
is mailed. Termination shall not affect the validity of any deposit or 
registration made earlier under the grant of special relief.
    (e) Use of copies and phonorecords deposited for the Library of 
Congress. Copies and phonorecords deposited for the Library of Congress 
under section 407 of title 17 and Sec. 202.19 of these regulations may 
be used to satisfy the deposit provisions of this section if they are 
accompanied by an application for registration of claim to copyright in 
the work represented by the deposit, and either a registration fee or a 
deposit account number on the application.

Sec. 202.21  Deposit of identifying material instead of copies.

    (a) General. Subject to the specific provisions of paragraphs (f) 
and (g) of this section, and to Secs. 202.19(e)(1)(iv) and 
202.20(d)(1)(iv), in any case where the deposit of identifying material 
is permitted or required under Sec. 202.19 or Sec. 202.20 of these 
regulations for published or unpublished works, the material shall 
consist of photographic prints, transparencies, photostats, drawings, or 
similar two-dimensional reproductions or renderings of the work, in a 
form visually perceivable without the aid of a machine or device. In the 
case of pictorial or graphic works, such material should reproduce the 
actual colors employed in the work. In all other cases, such material 
may be in black and white or may consist of a reproduction of the actual 
colors.
    (b) Completeness; number of sets. As many pieces of identifying 
material as are necessary to show the entire copyrightable content in 
the ordinary case, but in no case less than an adequate representation 
of such content, of the work for which deposit is being made, or for 
which registration is being sought shall be submitted. Except in cases 
falling under the provisions of Sec. 202.19(d)(2)(iii) or 
Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(iii) with respect to holograms, only one set of such 
complete identifying material is required.
    (c) Size. Photographic transparencies must be at least 35mm in size 
and, if such transparencies are 3x3 inches or

[[Page 523]]

less, must be fixed in cardboard, plastic, or similar mounts to 
facilitate identification, handling, and storage. The Copyright Office 
prefers that transparencies larger than 3x3 inches be mounted in a way 
that facilitates their handling and preservation, and reserves the right 
to require such mounting in particular cases. All types of identifying 
material other than photographic transparencies must be not less than 
3x3 inches and not more than 9x12 inches, but preferably 8x10 inches. 
Except in the case of transparencies, the image of the work must be 
either lifesize or larger, or if less than lifesize must be large enough 
to show clearly the entire copyrightable content of the work.
    (d) Title and dimensions. At least one piece of identifying material 
must, on its front, back, or mount, indicate the title of the work; and 
the indication of an exact measurement of one or more dimensions of the 
work is preferred.
    (e) Copyright notice. In the case of works published with notice of 
copyright, the notice and its position on the work must be clearly shown 
on at least one piece of identifying material. Where necessary because 
of the size or position of the notice, a separate drawing or similar 
reproduction shall be submitted. Such reproduction shall be no smaller 
than 3x3 inches and no larger than 9x12 inches, and shall show the exact 
appearance and content of the notice, and its specific position on the 
work.
    (f) For separate registration of an unpublished work that is fixed, 
or a published work that is published, only as embodied in a soundtrack 
that is an integral part of a motion picture, identifying material 
deposited in lieu of an actual copy of the motion picture shall consist 
of:
    (1) A transcription of the entire work, or a reproduction of the 
entire work on a phonorecord; and
    (2) Photographs or other reproductions from the motion picture 
showing the title of the motion picture, the soundtrack credits, and the 
copyright notice for the soundtrack, if any.

The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section do 
not apply to identifying material deposited under this paragraph (f).
    (g)(1) In the case of unpublished motion pictures (including 
transmission programs that have been fixed and transmitted to the 
public, but have not been published), identifying material deposited in 
lieu of an actual copy shall consist of either:
    (i) An audio cassette or other phonorecord reproducing the entire 
soundtrack or other sound portion of the motion picture, and description 
of the motion picture; or
    (ii) A set consisting of one frame enlargement or similar visual 
reproduction from each 10-minute segment of the motion picture, and a 
description of the motion picture.
    (2) In either case the ``description'' may be a continuity, a 
pressbook, or a synopsis but in all cases it must include:
    (i) The title or continuing title of the work, and the episode 
title, if any;
    (ii) The nature and general content of the program;
    (iii) The date when the work was first fixed and whether or not 
fixation was simultaneous with first transmission;
    (iv) The date of first transmission, if any;
    (v) The running time; and
    (vi) The credits appearing on the work, if any.
    (3) The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this 
section do not apply to identifying material submitted under this 
paragraph (g).
    (h) In the case where the deposit copy or copies of a motion picture 
cannot be viewed for examining purposes on equipment in the Examining 
Division of the Copyright Office, the ``description'' required by 
Sec. 202.20(c)(2)(ii) of these regulations may be a continuity, a press-
book, a synopsis, or a final shooting script but in all cases must be 
sufficient to indicate the copyrightable material in the work and 
include
    (1) The continuing title of the work and the episode title, if any;
    (2) The nature and general content of the program and of its 
dialogue or narration, if any;
    (3) The running time; and
    (4) All credits appearing on the work including the copyright 
notice, if any.

The provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section do not 
apply to

[[Page 524]]

identifying material submitted under this paragraph (h).

<R05>
Sec. 202.22  Acquisition and deposit of unpublished television transmission programs.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the 
acquisition of copies of unpublished television transmission programs by 
the Library of Congress under section 407(e) of title 17 of the United 
States Code, as amended by Pub. L. 94-553. It also prescribes rules 
pertaining to the use of such copies in the registration of claims to 
copyright, under section 408(b)(2).
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
    (1) The terms copies, fixed, publication, and transmission program 
and their variant forms, have the meanings given to them in section 101 
of title 17. The term network station has the meaning given it in 
section 111(f) of title 17.
    (2) Title 17 means title 17 of the United States Code, as amended by 
Pub. L. 94-553.
    (c) Off-the-air copying. (1) Library of Congress employees acting 
under the general authority of the Librarian of Congress may make a 
fixation of an unpublished television transmission program directly from 
a transmission to the public in the United States, in accordance with 
section 407(e)(1) and (4) of title 17 of the United States Code. The 
choice of programs selected for fixation shall be based on the Library 
of Congress acquisition policies in effect at the time of fixation. 
Specific notice of an intent to copy a transmission program off-the-air 
will ordinarily not be given. In general, the Library of Congress will 
seek to copy off-the-air a substantial portion of the programming 
transmitted by noncommercial educational broadcast stations as defined 
in section 397 of title 47 of the United States Code, and will copy off-
the-air selected programming transmitted by commercial broadcast 
stations, both network and independent.
    (2) Upon written request addressed to the Chief, Motion Picture, 
Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division by a broadcast station or other 
owner of the right of transmission, the Library of Congress will inform 
the requestor whether a particular transmission program has been copied 
off-the-air by the Library.
    (3) The Library of Congress will not knowingly copy off-the-air any 
unfixed or published television transmission program under the copying 
authority of section 407(e) of title 17 of the United States Code.
    (4) The Library of Congress is entitled under this paragraph (c) to 
presume that a television program transmitted to the public in the 
United States by a noncommercial educational broadcast station as 
defined in section 397 of title 47 of the United States Code has been 
fixed but not published.
    (5) The presumption established by paragraph (c)(4) of this section 
may be overcome by written declaration and submission of appropriate 
documentary evidence to the Chief, Motion Picture, Broadcasting and 
Recorded Sound Division, either before or after off-the-air copying of 
the particular transmission program by the Library of Congress. Such 
written submission shall contain:
    (i) The identification, by title and time of broadcast, of the 
transmission program in question;
    (ii) A brief statement declaring either that the program was not 
fixed or that it was published at the time of transmission;
    (iii) If it is declared that the program was published at the time 
of transmission, a brief statement of the facts of publication, 
including the date and place thereof, the method of publication, the 
name of the owner of the right of first publication, and whether the 
work was published in the United States with notice of copyright; and
    (iv) The actual handwritten signature of an officer or other duly 
authorized agent of the organization which transmitted the program in 
question.
    (6) A declaration that the program was unfixed at the time of 
transmission shall be accepted by the Library of Congress, unless the 
Library can cite evidence to the contrary, and the off-the-air copy will 
either be
    (i) Erased; or
    (ii) Retained, if requested by the owner of copyright or of any 
exclusive right, to satisfy the deposit provision

[[Page 525]]

of section 408 of title 17 of the United States Code.
    (7) If it is declared that the program was published at the time of 
transmission, the Library of Congress is entitled under this section to 
retain the copy to satisfy the deposit requirement of section 407(a) of 
title 17 of the United States Code.
    (8) The Library of Congress in making fixations of unpublished 
transmission programs transmitted by commercial broadcast stations shall 
not do so without notifying the transmitting organization or its agent 
that such activity is taking place. In the case of network stations, the 
notification will be sent to the particular network. In the case of any 
other commercial broadcasting station, the notification will be sent to 
the particular broadcast station that has transmitted, or will transmit, 
the program. Such notice shall, if possible, be given by the Library of 
Congress prior to the time of broadcast. In every case, the Library of 
Congress shall transmit such notice no later than fourteen days after 
such fixation has occurred. Such notice shall contain:
    (i) The identification, by title and time of broadcast, of the 
transmission program in question;
    (ii) A brief statement asserting the Library of Congress' belief 
that the transmission program has been, or will be by the date of 
transmission, fixed and is unpublished, together with language 
converting the notice to a demand for deposit under section 407 (a) and 
(b) of title 17 of the United States Code, if the transmission program 
has been published in the United States.
    (9) The notice required by paragraph (c)(8) of this section shall 
not cover more than one transmission program except that the notice may 
cover up to thirteen episodes of one title if such episodes are 
generally scheduled to be broadcast at the same time period on a regular 
basis, or may cover all the episodes comprising the title if they are 
scheduled to be broadcast within a period of not more than two months.
    (d) Demands for deposit of a television transmission program. (1) 
The Register of Copyrights may make a written demand upon the owner of 
the right of transmission in the United States to deposit a copy of a 
specific transmission program for the benefit of the Library of Congress 
under the authority of section 407(e)(2) of title 17 of the United 
States Code.
    (2) The Register of Copyrights is entitled to presume, unless clear 
evidence to the contrary is proffered, that the transmitting 
organization is the owner of the United States transmission right.
    (3) Notices of demand shall be in writing and shall contain:
    (i) The identification, by title and time of broadcast, of the work 
in question;
    (ii) An explanation of the optional forms of compliance, including 
transfer of ownership of a copy to the Library, lending a copy to the 
Library for reproduction, or selling a copy to the Library at a price 
not to exceed the cost of reproducing and supplying the copy;
    (iii) A ninety-day deadline by which time either compliance or a 
request for an extension of a request to adjust the scope of the demand 
or the method for fulfilling it shall have been received by the Register 
of Copyrights;
    (iv) A brief description of the controls which are placed on the 
copies' use;
    (v) A statement concerning the Register's perception of the 
publication status of the program, together with language converting 
this demand to a demand for a deposit, under 17 U.S.C. 407 (a) and (c), 
if the recipient takes the position that the work is published; and
    (vi) A statement that a compliance copy must be made and retained if 
the notice is received prior to transmission.
    (4) With respect to paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, the sale 
of a copy in compliance with a demand of this nature shall be at a price 
not to exceed the cost to the Library of reproducing and supplying the 
copy. The notice of demand should therefore inform the recipient of that 
cost and set that cost, plus reasonable shipping charges, as the maximum 
price for such a sale.
    (5) Copies transferred, lent, or sold under paragraph (d) of this 
section shall be of sound physical condition as described in Appendix A 
to this section.

[[Page 526]]

    (6) Special relief. In the case of any demand made under paragraph 
(d) of this section the Register of Copyrights may, after consultation 
with other appropriate officials of the Library of Congress and upon 
such conditions as the Register may determine after such consultation,
    (i) Extend the time period provided in subparagraph (d)(3)(iii);
    (ii) Make adjustments in the scope of the demand; or
    (iii) Make adjustments in the method of fulfilling the demand. Any 
decision as to whether to allow such extension or adjustments shall be 
made by the Register of Copyrights after consultation with other 
appropriate officials of the Library of Congress and shall be made as 
reasonably warranted by the circumstances. Requests for special relief 
under paragraph (d) of this section shall be made in writing to the 
Copyright Acquisitions Division, shall be signed by or on behalf of the 
owner of the right of transmission in the United States and shall set 
forth the specific reasons why the request shall be granted.
    (e) Disposition and use of copies. (1) All copies acquired under 
this section shall be maintained by the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and 
Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress. The Library may make 
one archival copy of a program which it has fixed under the provisions 
of section 407(e)(1) of title 17 of the United States Code and paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (2) All copies acquired or made under this section, except copies of 
transmission programs consisting of a regularly scheduled newscast or 
on-the-spot coverage of news events, shall be subject to the 
restrictions concerning copying and access found in Library of Congress 
Regulation 818-17, Policies Governing the Use and Availability of Motion 
Pictures and Other Audiovisual Works in the Collections of the Library 
of Congress, or its successors. Copies of transmission programs 
consisting of regularly scheduled newscasts or on-the-spot coverage of 
news events are subject to the provisions of the ``American Television 
and Radio Archives Act'' (section 170 of title 2 of the United States 
Code) and such regulations as the Librarian of Congress shall prescribe.
    (f) Registration of claims to copyright. (1) Copies fixed by the 
Library of Congress under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this 
section may be used as the deposit for copyright registration provided 
that:
    (i) The application and fee, in a form acceptable for registration, 
is received by the Copyright Office not later than ninety days after 
transmission of the program, and
    (ii) Correspondence received by the Copyright Office in the envelope 
containing the application and fee states that a fixation of the instant 
work was made by the Library of Congress and requests that the copy so 
fixed be used to satisfy the registration deposit provisions.
    (2) Copies transferred, lent, or sold to the Library of Congress 
under the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section may be used as the 
deposit for copyright registration purposes only when the application 
and fee, in a form acceptable for registration, accompany, in the same 
container, the copy lent, transferred, or sold, and there is an 
explanation that the copy is intended to satisfy both the demand issued 
under section 407(e)(2) of title 17 of the United States Code and the 
registration deposit provisions.
    (g) Agreements modifying the terms of this section. (1) The Library 
of Congress may, at its sole discretion, enter into an agreement whereby 
the provision of copies of unpublished television transmission programs 
on terms different from those contained in this section is authorized.
    (2) Any such agreement may be terminated without notice by the 
Library of Congress.

Sec. 202.23  Full term retention of copyright deposits.

    (a) General. (1) This section prescribes conditions under which a 
request for full term retention, under the control of the Copyright 
Office, of copyright

[[Page 527]]

deposits (copies, phonorecords, or identifying material) of published 
works may be made and granted or denied pursuant to section 704(e) of 
title 17 of the United States Code. Only copies, phonorecords, or 
identifying material deposited in connection with registration of a 
claim to copyright under title 17 of the United States Code are within 
the provisions of this section. Only the depositor or the copyright 
owner of record of the work identified by the copyright deposit, or a 
duly authorized agent of the depositor or copyright owner, may request 
full term retention. A fee for this service is fixed by this section 
pursuant to section 708(a)(11) of title 17 of the United States Code.
    (2) For purposes of this section, under the control of the Copyright 
Office shall mean within the confines of Copyright Office buildings and

a Federal records center, but does not include transfer to the Library 
of Congress collections.
    (3) For purposes of this section, full term retention means 
retention for a period of 75 years from the date of publication of the 
work identified by the particular copyright deposit which is retained.
    (4) For purposes of this section, copyright deposit or its plural 
means the copy, phonorecord, or identifying material submitted to the 
Copyright Office in connection with a published work that is 
subsequently registered and made part of the records of the Office.
    (b) Form and content of request for full term retention--(1) Forms. 
The Copyright Office does not provide printed forms for the use of 
persons requesting full term retention of copyright deposits.
    (2) Requests for full term retention must be made in writing 
addressed to the Chief, Information and Reference Division of the 
Copyright Office, and shall (i) be signed by or on behalf of the 
depositor or copyright owner of record, and (ii) clearly indicate that 
full term retention is desired.
    (3) The request for full term retention must adequately identify the 
particular copyright deposit to be retained, preferably by including the 
title used in the registration application, the name of the depositor or 
copyright owner of record, the publication date, and, if registration 
was completed earlier, the registration number.
    (c) Conditions under which requests will be granted or denied--(1) 
General. A request that meets the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section will generally be granted if the copyright deposit for which 
full term retention is requested has been continuously in the custody of 
the Copyright Office and the Library of Congress has not, by the date of 
the request, selected the copyright deposit for its collections.
    (2) Time of request. The request for full term retention of a 
particular copyright deposit may be made at the time of deposit or at 
any time thereafter; however, the request will be granted only if at 
least one copy, phonorecord, or set of identifying material is in the 
custody of the Copyright Office at the time of the request. Where the 
request is made concurrent with the initial deposit of the work for 
registration, the requestor must submit one copy or phonorecord more 
than the number specified in Sec. 202.20 of for the particular work.
    (3) One deposit retained. The Copyright Office will retain no more 
than one copy, phonorecord, or set of identifying material for a given 
registered work.
    (4) Denial of request for full term retention. The Copyright Office 
reserves the right to deny the request for full term retention where:
    (i) The excessive size, fragility, or weight of the deposit would, 
in the sole discretion of the Register of Copyrights, constitute an 
unreasonable storage burden. The request may nevertheless be granted if, 
within 60 calendar days of the original denial of the request, the 
requestor pays the reasonable administrative costs, as fixed in the 
particular case by the Register of Copyrights, of preparing acceptable 
identifying materials for retention in lieu of the actual copyright 
deposit;
    (ii) The Library of Congress has selected for its collections the 
single copyright deposit, or both, if two copies or phonorecords were 
deposited; or
    (iii) Retention would result in a health or safety hazard, in the 
sole

[[Page 528]]

judgment of the Register of Copyrights. The request may nevertheless be 
granted if, within 60 calendar days of the original denial of the 
request, the requestor pays the reasonable administrative costs, as 
fixed in the particular case by the Register of Copyrights of preparing 
acceptable identifying materials for retention in lieu of the actual 
copyright deposit.
    (d) Form of copyright deposit. If full term retention is granted, 
the Copyright Office will retain under its control the particular 
copyright deposit used to make registration for the work. Any deposit 
made on or after September 19, 1978, shall satisfy the requirements of 
Secs. 202.20 and 202.21.
    (e) Fee for full term retention. (1) Pursuant to section 708(a)(11) 
of title 17 of the United States Code, the Register of Copyrights has 
fixed the fee for full term retention, as prescribed in Sec. 201.3(d), 
for each copyright deposit granted full term retention.
    (2) A check or money order in the amount prescribed in Sec. 201.3(d) 
payable to the Register of Copyrights, must be received in the Copyright 
Office within 60 calendar days from the date of mailing of the Copyright 
Office's notification to the requestor that full term retention has been 
granted for a particular copyright deposit.
    (3) The Copyright Office will issue a receipt acknowledging payment 
of the fee and identifying the copyright deposit for which full term 
retention has been granted.
    (f) Selection by Library of Congress--(1) General. All published 
copyright deposits are available for selection by the Library of 
Congress until the Copyright Office has formally granted a request for 
full term retention. Unless the requestor has deposited the additional 
copy or phonorecord specified by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the 
Copyright Office will not process a request for full term retention 
submitted concurrent with a copyright registration application and 
deposit, until the Library of Congress has had a reasonable amount of 
time to make its selection determination.
    (2) A request for full term retention made at the time of deposit of 
a published work does not affect the right of the Library to select one 
or both of the copyright deposits.
    (3) If one copyright deposit is selected, the second deposit, if 
any, will be used for full term retention.
    (4) If both copyright deposits are selected, or, in the case where 
the single deposit made is selected, full term retention will be granted 
only if the additional copy or phonorecord specified by paragraph (c)(2) 
was deposited.
    (g) Termination of full term storage. Full term storage will cease 
75 years after the date of publication of the work identified by the 
copyright deposit retained, and the copyright deposit will be disposed 
of in accordance with section 704, paragraphs (b) through (d), of title 
17 of the United States Code.

 Appendix A to Part 202--Technical Guidelines Regarding Sound Physical 
                                Condition

    To be considered a copy ``of sound physical condition'' within the 
meaning of 37 CFR 202.22(d)(5), a copy shall conform to all the 
technical guidelines set out in this Appendix.
    A. Physical Condition. All portions of the copy that reproduce the 
transmission program must be:
    1. Clean: Free from dirt, marks, spots, fungus, or other smudges, 
blotches, blemishes, or distortions;
    2. Undamaged: Free from burns, blisters, tears, cuts, scratches, 
breaks, erasure, or other physical damage. The copies must also be free 
from:
    (i) Any damage that interferes with performance from the tape or 
other reproduction, including physical damage resulting from earlier 
mechanical difficulties such as cassette jamming, breaks, tangles, or 
tape overflow; and
    (ii) Any erasures, damage causing visual or audible defects or 
distortions or any material remaining from incomplete erasure of 
previously recorded works.
    3. Unspliced: Free from splices in any part of the copy reproducing 
the transmission program, regardless of whether the splice involves the 
addition or deletion of material or is intended to repair a break or 
cut.
    4. Undeteriorated: Free from any visual or aural deterioration 
resulting from aging or exposure to climatic, atmospheric, or other 
chemical or physical conditions, including heat, cold, humidity, 
electromagnetic fields, or radiation. The copy shall also be free from

[[Page 529]]

excessive brittleness or stretching, from any visible flaking of oxide 
from the tape base or other medium, and from other visible signs of 
physical deterioration or excessive wear.
    B. Physical Appurtenances of Deposit Copy.
    1. Physical Housing of Video Tape Copy. (a) In the case of video 
tape reproduced for reel-to-reel performance, the deposit copy shall 
consist of reels of uniform size and length. The length of the reels 
will depend on both the size of the tape and its running time (the last 
reel may be shorter). (b) In the case of video tape reproduced for 
cassette, cartridge, or similar performance, the tape drive mechanism 
shall be fully operable and free from any mechanical defects.
    2. ``Leader'' or Equivalent. The copy, whether housed in reels, 
cassettes, or cartridges, shall have a leader segment both preceding the 
beginning and following the end of the recording.
    C. Visual and Aural Quality of Copy:
    1. Visual Quality. The copy should be equivalent to an evaluated 
first generation copy from an edited master tape and must reproduce a 
flawless and consistent electronic signal that meets industry standards 
for television screening.
    2. Aural Quality. The sound channels or other portions must 
reproduce a flawless and consistent electronic signal without any 
audible defects.

Appendix B to Part 202--``Best Edition'' of Published Copyrighted Works 
             for the Collections of the Library of Congress

    The copyright law (title 17, United States Code) requires that 
copies or phonorecords deposited in the Copyright Office be of the 
``best edition'' of the work. The law states that ``The `best edition' 
of a work is the edition, published in the United States at any time 
before the date of deposit, that the Library of Congress determines to 
be most suitable for its purposes.'' (For works first published only in 
a country other than the United States, the law requires the deposit of 
the best edition as first published.)
    When two or more editions of the same version of a work have been 
published, the one of the highest quality is generally considered to be 
the best edition. In judging quality, the Library of Congress will 
adhere to the criteria set forth below in all but exceptional 
circumstances.
    Where differences between editions represent variations in 
copyrightable content, each edition is a separate version and ``best 
edition'' standards based on such differences do not apply. Each such 
version is a separate work for the purpose of the copyright law.
    The criteria to be applied in determining the best edition of each 
of several types of material are listed below in descending order of 
importance. In deciding between two editions, a criterion-by-criterion 
comparison should be made. The edition which first fails to satisfy a 
criterion is to be considered of inferior quality and will not be an 
acceptable deposit. Example: If a comparison is made between two 
hardbound editions of a book, one a trade edition printed on acid-free 
paper, and the other a specially bound edition printed on average paper, 
the former will be the best edition because the type of paper is a more 
important criterion than the binding.
    Under regulations of the Copyright Office, potential depositors may 
request authorization to deposit copies or phonorecords of other than 
the best edition of a specific work (e.g., a microform rather than a 
printed edition of a serial), by requesting ``special relief'' from the 
deposit requirements. All requests for special relief should be in 
writing and should state the reason(s) why the applicant cannot send the 
required deposit and what the applicant wishes to submit instead of the 
required deposit.

                        I. Printed Textual Matter

    A. Paper, Binding, and Packaging:
    1. Archival-quality rather than less-permanent paper.

insertions are to be issued. In the case of looseleaf materials, this 
includes the submission of all binders and indexes when they are part of 
the unit as published and offered for sale or distribution. 
Additionally, the regular and timely receipt of all appropriate 
looseleaf updates, supplements, and releases including supplemental 
binders issued to handle these expanded versions, is part of the 
requirement to properly maintain these publications.
    9. Slip-cased rather than nonslip-cased.
    10. With protective folders rather than without (for broadsides).
    11. Rolled rather than folded (for broadsides).

edition, one copy outside the numbered series but otherwise identical.
    3. A photographic reproduction of the original, by special 
arrangement only.

Sec. 203.2  Authority and functions.

    (a) The administration of the copyright law was entrusted to the 
Library of Congress by an act of Congress in 1870, and the Copyright 
Office has been a separate department of the Library since 1897. The 
statutory functions of the Copyright Office are contained in and carried 
out in accordance with the

Copyright Act. Pub. L. 94-553 (90 Stat. 2541-2602), 17 U.S.C. 101-1101.

[43 FR 774, Jan. 4, 1978, as amended at 62 FR 35421, July 1, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 203.3  Organization.

    (a) In general. The Office of the Register exercises overall 
direction of the work of the Copyright Office, including work in 
conjunction with copyright legislation, litigation and promulgation of 
copyright regulations. The Office of the Register of Copyrights includes 
the legal, administrative, and automation staff.
    (b) The Associate Register of Copyright for Operations has oversight 
of the operating divisions of the Copyright Office. The operating 
divisions are:
    (1) The Receiving and Processing Division, which receives incoming 
materials, dispatches outgoing materials and establishes control over 
fiscal accounts.
    (2) The Examining Division, which examines all applications and 
material presented to the Copyright Office for registration of original 
and renewal copyright claims, and which determines whether the material 
deposited constitutes coyrightable subject matter and whether the other 
legal and formal requirements of title 17 have been met.
    (3) The Cataloging Division, which prepares the bibliographic 
description of all copyrighted works registered in the Copyright Office, 
including the recording of legal facts of copyright pertaining to each 
work, in an on-line database in which copyright records can be searched; 
and which also examines and catalogs in an on-line database documents 
submitted for recordation.
    (4) The Information and Reference Division, which provides a 
national copyright information service through the Public Information 
Office, educates the public on the copyright law, issues and distributes 
information materials, responds to reference requests regarding 
copyright matters, prepares search reports based upon copyright records, 
certifies copies of legal documents concerned with copyright, and 
maintains liaison with the United States Customs Service, the Department 
of the Treasury, and the United States Postal Service on certain 
matters. The Information and Reference Division also develops, services, 
stores, and preserves the official records and catalogs of the Copyright 
Office, including applications for registration, historical records, and 
materials deposited for copyright registration that are not selected by 
the Library of Congress for addition to its collections.
    (5) The Licensing Division, which implements the sections of the 
Copyright Act dealing with secondary transmissions of radio and 
television programs, compulsory licenses for making and distributing 
phonorecords of nondramatic musical, pictorial, graphic, and sculptural 
works in connection with noncommercial broadcasting. The Licensing 
Division is in charge of collecting the statutory royalties and 
distributing these royalties based on either a voluntary agreement among 
the interested parties or a determination of the Copyright Arbitration 
Royalty Panels.
    (c) The Copyright General Counsel is a principal legal officer of 
the Office. The General Counsel has overall supervisory responsibility 
for the legal staff and primary responsibility for providing liaison on 
legal matters between the Office and the Congress, the Department of 
Justice and other agencies of Government, the courts, the legal 
community, and a wide range of interests affected by the copyright law. 
The Copyright General Counsel has responsibility for overseeing all 
functions related to the administration of the compulsory licenses 
including oversight of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels.
    (d) The Associate Register of Copyrights for International Affairs 
and Policy is a principal legal adviser to the Register with primary 
responsibility for the international aspects of copyright protection, as 
well as legislative and policy matters.
    (e) The Associate Register of Copyrights for National Programs is 
primarily responsible for initiating, planning, developing, and 
implementing projects and activities related to the Copyright Office 
electronic registration, recordations, and deposit system (CORDS).

[[Page 533]]

    (f) The Office has no field organization.
    (g) The Office is located in The James Madison Memorial Building of 
the Library of Congress, 1st and Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, 
DC. 20559-6000. The Public Information Office is located in Room LM-401. 
Its hours are 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday except legal 
holidays. The phone number of the Public Information Office is (202) 
707-3000. Informational material regarding the copyright law, the 
registration process, fees, and related information about the Copyright 
Office and its functions may be obtained free of charge from the Public 
Information Office upon request.
    (h) All Copyright Office forms may be obtained free of charge from 
the Public Information Office or by calling the Copyright Office Hotline 
anytime day or night at (202) 707-9100.
    (i) The Copyright Office maintains an ``electronic reading room'' by 
making available certain documents and records on its World Wide Web 
page and by providing access to documents that affect the public in 
electronic format pursuant to 5 USC 552(a)(2). Copyright Office records 
in machine-readable form cataloged from January 1, 1978, to the present, 
including registration information and recorded documents, are available 
on the Internet. Frequently requested Copyright Office circulars, 
announcements, and recently proposed as well as final regulations are 
available on-line. The address for the Copyright Office's home page is: 
http://www.loc.gov/copyright; information may also be accessed by 
connecting to the Library of Congress' home page on the World Wide Web. 
The address is: http://www.loc.gov. Other Copyright Office documents may 
be provided on disk when so requested.

                               Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 203.4  Methods of operation.

    (a) In accordance with section 552(a)(2) of the Freedom of 
Information Act, the Copyright Office makes available for public 
inspection and copying records of copyright registrations and of final 
refusals to register claims to copyright; statements of policy and 
interpretations which have been adopted but are not published in the 
Federal Register; and administrative staff manuals and instructions to 
the staff that affect a member of the public.
    (b) The Copyright Office also maintains and makes available for 
public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying 
information as to matters issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 
1967, that are within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). The Copyright 
Office has determined that publication of these indexes is unnecessary 
and impractical. Copies of the indexes will be provided to any member of 
the public upon request at the cost of reproduction.
    (c) The material and indexes referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section are available for public inspection and copying at the 
Public Information Office of the Copyright Office, Room LM-401, The 
James Madison Memorial Building of the Library of Congress, 1st and 
Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. 
and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
    (d) The Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist is responsible 
for responding to all initial requests submitted under the Freedom of 
Information Act. Individuals desiring to obtain access to Copyright 
Office information under the Act should make a written request to that 
effect either by mail to the Supervisory Copyright Information 
Specialist, Information and Publications Section, Information and 
Reference Division, Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, 
DC 20559-6000, or in person between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on 
any working day except legal holidays at Room LM-401, The James Madison 
Memorial Building, 1st and Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC. If a 
request is made by mail, both the request and the envelope containing it 
should be plainly marked Freedom of Information Act Request. Failure to 
so mark a mailed request may delay the Office response.

[[Page 534]]

    (e) Records must be reasonably described. A request reasonably 
describes records if it enables the Office to identify the records 
requested by any process that is not unreasonably burdensome or 
disruptive of Office operations. The Supervisory Copyright Information 
Specialist will, upon request, aid members of the public to formulate 
their requests in such a manner as to enable the Office to respond 
effectively and reduce search costs for the requester.
    (f) The Office will respond to all properly marked mailed requests 
and all personally delivered written requests for records within twenty 
(20) working days of receipt by the Supervisory Copyright Information 
Specialist. Inquiries should be mailed to: Copyright Office, GC/I&R, 
P.O. Box 70400 Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024. If hand 
delivered, materials should go to: Copyright Public Information Office, 
LM 401, James Madison Memorial Building, Library of Congress, 101 
Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC. Office hours are from 8:30 a.m. 
to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. If it is 
determined that an extension of time greater than ten (10) working days 
is necessary to respond to a request due to unusual circumstances, as 
defined in paragraph (i) of this section, the Supervisory Copyright 
Information Specialist shall so notify the requester and give the 
requester the opportunity to:
    (1) Limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed 
within twenty (20) working days, or
    (2) Arrange with the Office an alternative time frame for processing 
the request or a modified request. If a request is denied, the written 
notification will include the basis for the denial, names of all 
individuals who participated in the determination, and procedures 
available to appeal the determination. If a requester wishes to appeal a 
denial of some or all of his or her request for information, he or she 
must make an appeal in writing within 30 calendar days of the date of 
the Office's denial. The request should be directed to the General 
Counsel of the United States Copyright Office at: Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. 
Box 70400, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024. The appeal should be 
clearly labeled `Freedom of Information Act Appeal'.
    (g) The appeal shall include a statement explaining the basis for 
the appeal. Determinations of appeals will be set forth in writing and 
signed by the General Counsel or his or her delegate within 20 working 
days. If, on appeal, the denial is in whole or in part upheld, the 
written determination will include the basis for the appeal denial and 
will also contain a notification of the provisions for judicial review 
and the names of the persons who participated in the determination.
    (h) In unusual circumstances, the General Counsel may extend the 
time limits prescribed in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section for not 
more than 10 working days. The extension period may be split between the 
initial request and the appeal but the total period of extension shall 
not exceed 10 working days. Extensions will be by written notice to the 
person making the request. The Copyright Office will advise the 
requester of the reasons for the extension and the date the 
determination is expected. As used in this paragraph ``unusual 
circumstances'' means:
    (1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from 
establishments that are physically separate from the office processing 
the request;
    (2) The need to search for, collect, and examine a voluminous amount 
of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; 
or
    (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all 
practical speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in 
the determination of the request or among two or more components of the 
Copyright Office which have a substantial subject matter interest 
therein.
    (i) The Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist will consider 
requests for expedited processing of requests in cases where the 
requester demonstrates a compelling need for such processing. The term 
``compelling need'' means:

[[Page 535]]

    (1) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis 
could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (2) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning 
actual or alleged Federal Government activity. Requesters for expedited 
processing must include in their requests a statement setting forth the 
basis for the claim that a ``compelling need'' exists for the requested 
information, certified by the requester to be true and correct to the 
best of his or her knowledge and belief. The Office will determine 
whether to grant a request for expedited processing and will notify the 
requester of such determination within ten (10) days of receipt of the 
request. If a request for expedited processing is approved, documents 
responsive to the request will be processed as soon as is practicable. 
Denials of requests for expedited processing may be appealed to the 
Office of the General Counsel.

                       Availability of Information


<R05>
Sec. 203.5  Inspection and copying.

    (a) When a request for information has been approved, the person 
making the request may make an appointment to inspect or copy the 
materials requested during regular business hours by writing or 
telephoning the Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist at the 
address or telephone number listed in Sec. 203.4(d). Such material may 
be copied manually without charge, and reasonable facilities are 
available in the Public Information Office for that purpose. Also, 
copies of individual pages of such materials will be made available at 
the price per page specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 203.6.

                   Charges for Search for Reproduction


<R05>
Sec. 203.6  Schedule of fees and methods of payment for services rendered.

    (a) General. The fee schedule of this section does not apply with 
respect to the charging of fees for those records for which the 
Copyright Act of 1976, title 17 of the United States Code (Pub. L. 94-
553) requires a fee to be charged. The fees required to be charged are 
contained in Sec. 201.3 of this chapter, or have been established by the 
Register of Copyrights or Library of Congress pursuant to the 
requirements of that section. If the Copyright Office receives a request 
for copies or other services involving the public records or indexes of 
the Office or for copies of deposited articles for which a fee is 
required to be charged, the Office will notify the requester of the 
procedure established to obtain the copies or services and the amount of 
the chargeable fees. Fees pursuant to title 5 U.S.C., section 552 for 
all other services not involving the public records of the Copyright 
Office will be assessed according to the schedule in paragraph (b) of 
this section. All fees so assessed shall be charged to the requester, 
except where the charge is limited under paragraph (c) of this section 
or where a waiver or reduction of fees is granted under paragraph (d) of 
this section. Requests by record subjects asking for copies of records 
about themseleves shall be processed under the Privacy Act fee schedule 
found in 37 CFR 204.6.
    (b) FOIA requests. In responding to requests under this part the 
following fees shall be assessed, unless a waiver or reduction in fees 
has been granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section:
    (1) For copies of certificates of copyright registration, $25.
    (2) For copies of all other Copyright Office records not otherwise 
provided for in this section a minimum fee of $15.00 for up to 15 pages 
and $.50 per page over 15.
    (3) For each hour or fraction of an hour spent in searching for a 
requested record, $65, except that no search fee

[[Page 536]]

shall be assessed with respect to requests by educational institutions, 
non-commercial scientific institutions, and representatives of the news 
media. Search fees shall be assessed with respect to all other requests, 
subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section. Fees may be 
assessed for time spent searching even if the search fails to locate any 
responsive records or where the records located are subsequently 
determined to be entirely exempt from disclosure.
    (4) For the issuance of any certification, $65 for each hour or 
fraction of an hour consumed in respect thereto.
    (5) Other costs incurred by the Copyright Office in fulfilling a 
request will be chargeable at the actual cost of the Office.
    (6) For computer searches of records, which may be undertaken 
through the use of existing programing, the actual direct costs of 
conducting the search including the cost of operating a central 
processing unit for that portion of operating time that is directly 
attributable to searching for records responsive to a request, as well 
as the direct costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to 
search (at no less than $65 per hour or fraction thereof).
    (7) No review fees will be charged for time spent in resolving legal 
or policy issues affecting access to Office records. No charge will be 
made for the time involved in examining records to determine whether 
some or all such records may be withheld.
    (c) Fee limitations. The following limitations on fees shall apply:
    (1) Except for requesters seeking records for commercial use the 
following will be provided without charge--
    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or its cost equivalent), and
    (ii) The first two hours of search (or its cost equivalent).
    (2) No fees will be charged for ordinary packaging and mailing 
costs.
    (d) Waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records responsive to a request 
under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be furnished without charge or at a charge 
reduced below that established under paragraph (b) of this section where 
the Office determines, based upon information provided by a requester in 
support of a fee waiver request or otherwise made known to the Office, 
that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest 
because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding 
of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily 
in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for a waiver or 
reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.
    (2) In order to determine whether the first fee waiver requirement 
is met--i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the government--
the Office shall consider the following four factors in sequence:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government.''
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities.
    (iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the 
public likely to result from disclosures: Whether disclosure of the 
requested information will contribute to ``public understanding.''
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government operations or activities.
    (3) In order to determine whether the second fee waiver requirement 
is met--i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is not 
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester--the Office shall 
consider the following two factors in sequence:
    (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure.
    (ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of 
the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily

[[Page 537]]

in the commercial interest of the requester.''
    (4) Where only a portion of the requested records satisfies both of 
the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph, 
a waiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion.
    (e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. Where the Office 
determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed under this section 
may amoun t to more than $25.00, the Office shall notify the requester 
as soon as praticable of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, 
unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay 
fees as high as those anticipated. (If only a portion of the fee can be 
estimated readily, the Office shall advise the requester that the 
estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee.) In cases where a 
requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees may amount to 
more than $25.00, the requests will be deemed not to have been received 
until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee. A 
notice to a requester pursuant to this paragraph shall offer him the 
opportunity to confer with Copyright Office personnel in order to 
reformulate his request to meet his needs at a lower cost.
    (f) Aggregation of requests. Where the Office reasonably believes 
that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is 
attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose 
of evading the assessment of fees, the Office may aggregate any such 
requests and charge accordingly.
    (g) Advance payments. (1) Where the Office estimates that a total 
fee to be assessed under this section is likely to exceed $250.00, it 
may require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to 
the entire estimated fee before beginning to process the request, except 
where it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a 
requester with a history of prompt payment.
    (2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a records access 
fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the Office may require the 
requester to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest (as 
provided for in paragraph (h) of this section), and to make an advance 
payment of the full amount of any estimated fee before the Office begins 
to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from 
that requester.
    (3) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (g)(1) and 
(g)(2) of this section, the Office shall not require the requester to 
make an advance payment, i.e., a payment made before work is commenced 
or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed is 
not an advance payment.
    (h) Charging interest. The Office may assess interest charges on an 
unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill 
was sent to the requester. Once a fee payment has been received by a 
component of the Office, even if not processed, the accrual of interest 
shall be stayed. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate 
prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C. and shall accrue from the 
date of billing.

Sec. 204.3  General policy.

    The Copyright Office serves primarily as an office of public record. 
Section 705 of title 17, United States Code, requires the Copyright 
Office to open for public inspection all records of copyright deposits, 
registrations, recordations, and other actions taken under title 17. 
Therefore, a routine use of all Copyright Office systems of records 
created under section 705 of title 17 is disclosure to the public. All 
Copyright Office systems of records created under section 705 of title 
17 are also available for public copying as required by section 706(a), 
with the exception of copyright deposits, whose reproduction is governed 
by section 706(b) and the regulations issued under that section. In 
addition to the records mandated by section 705 of title 17, the 
Copyright Office maintains other systems of records which are necessary 
for the Office effectively to carry out its mission. These systems of 
records are routinely consulted and otherwise used by Copyright Office 
employees in the performance of their duties. The Copyright Office will 
not sell, rent, or otherwise make publicly available any mailing list 
prepared by the Office.

[47 FR 36821, Aug. 24, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 204.4  Procedure for notification of the existence of records pertaining to individuals.

    (a) The Copyright Office will publish in the Federal Register, upon 
the establishment or revision of the system of records, notices of all 
Copyright Office systems of records subject to the Privacy Act, as 
provided by 5 U.S.C., section 552a(e)(4). Individuals desiring to know 
if a Copyright Office system of records contains a record pertaining to 
them should submit a written request to that effect either by mail to 
the Supervisory Copyright Information Specialist, Information Section, 
Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. Box 70400, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 
20024, or in person between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on any 
working day except legal holidays at Room LM-401, The James Madison 
Memorial Building, 1st and Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC.
    (b) The written request should identify clearly the system of 
records which is the subject of inquiry, by reference, whenever 
possible, to the system number and title as given in the notices of 
systems of records in the Federal Register. Both the written request and 
the envelope carrying it should be plainly marked ``Privacy Act 
Request.'' Failure to so mark the request may delay the Office response.
    (c) The Office will acknowledge all properly marked requests made by 
individuals wishing to gain access to view or copy their records or any 
information pertaining to the individual, within a reasonable time. The 
Office

[[Page 539]]

will acknowledge in writing an individual's request to amend a record 
pertaining to him or her within ten business days.
    (d) Since all Copyright Office Records created under section 705 of 
title 17 are open to public inspection, no identity verification is 
necessary for individuals who wish to know whether a system of records 
created under section 705 pertains to them.

Sec. 204.6  Fees.

    (a) The Copyright Office will provide, free of charge, one copy to 
an individual of any record pertaining to that individual contained in a 
Copyright Office system of records, except where the request is for a 
copy of a record for which a specific fee is required and identified in 
Sec. 201.3 of this chapter, in which case that fee shall be charged. For 
additional copies of records not covered by section 708 the fee will be 
a minimum of $15.00 for up to 15 pages and $.50 per page over 15. The 
Office will require prepayment of fees estimated to exceed $25.00 and 
will remit any excess paid or bill an additional amount according to the 
differences between the final fee charged and the amount prepaid. When 
prepayment is required, a request is not deemed ``received'' until 
prepayment has been made.
    (b) The Copyright Office may waive the fee requirement whenever it 
determines that such waiver would be in the public interest.

    (a) Any individual may request the correction or amendment of a 
record pertaining to her or him. With respect to an error in a copyright 
registration, the procedure for correction and fee chargeable is 
governed by section 408(d) of title 17 of the United States Code, and 
the regulations issued as authorized by that section. With respect to an 
error in any other record, the request shall be in writing and delivered 
either by mail addressed to the Supervisory Copyright Information 
Specialist, Information Section, Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. Box 70400,

Avenue, SE, Washington, DC. The request shall explain why the individual 
believes the record to be incomplete, inaccurate, irrelevant, or 
untimely.

[[Page 540]]

    (b) With respect to an error in a copyright registration, the time 
limit for Office response to requests for correction is governed by 
section 408(d) of Pub. L. 94-553, and the regulations issued as 
authorized by that section. With respect to other requests for 
correction or amendment of records, the Office will respond within ten 
working days indicating to the requester that the requested correction 
or amendment has been made or that it has been refused. If the requested 
correction or amendment is refused, the Office response will indicate 
the reason for the refusal and the procedure available to the individual 
to appeal the refusal.

<R05>
Sec. 204.8  Appeal of refusal to correct or amend an individual's record.

    (a) An individual who disagrees with a refusal of the Copyright 
Office to amend his or her record may request a review of the denial. 
The decision will be made within 30 business days, unless the Office can 
demonstrate good cause for extending the 30 day period. If the requestor 
is dissatisfied with the agency's final determination, the individual 
may bring a civil action against the Office in the appropriate United 
States district court. appeal the refusal to correct or amend a record 
pertaining to the individual. The individual should submit a written 
appeal to the General Counsel, Copyright Office, Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. 
Box 70400, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024. Appeals, and the 
envelopes containing them, should be plainly marked ``Privacy Act 
Appeal.'' Failure to so mark the appeal may delay the Copyright Office 
General Counsel's response. An appeal should contain a copy of the 
request for amendment or correction and a copy of the record alleged to 
be untimely, inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant.
    (b) The General Counsel will issue a written decision granting or 
denying the appeal within 30 working days after receipt of the appeal 
unless, after showing good cause, the General Counsel extends the 30 day 
period. If the appeal is granted, the requested amendment or correction 
will be made promptly. If the appeal is denied, in whole or part, the 
General Counsel's decision will set forth reasons for the denial. 
Additionally, the decision will advise the requester that he or she has 
the right to file with the Copyright Office a concise statement of his

<R05>
Sec. 211.4  Registration of claims of protection in mask works.

    (a) General. This section prescribes conditions for the registration 
of claims of protection in mask works pursuant to section 908 of title 
17 U.S.C.
    (b) Application for registration. (1) For purposes of registration 
of mask work claims, the Register of Copyrights has designated ``Form 
MW'' to be used for all applications submitted on and after January 7, 
1985. Copies of the form are available free upon request to the Public 
Information Office, U.S. Copyright Office, Library of Congress, 
Washington, DC 20559. Applications submitted before January 7, 1985 will 
be dated January 7, 1985.
    (2) An application for registration of a mask work claim may be 
submitted by the owner of the mask work, or the duly authorized agent of 
any such owner.
    (i) The owner of a mask work includes a party that has obtained the 
transfer of all of the exclusive rights in the work, but does not 
include the transferee of less than all of the exclusive rights, or the 
licensee of all or less than all of these rights.
    (ii) For purposes of eligibility to claim mask work protection 
pursuant to section 902(a)(1)(A) of 17 U.S.C., the owner of the mask 
work must be either the initial owner or a person who has obtained by 
transfer the totality of rights in the mask work under the Act.
    (3) An application for registration shall be submitted on Form MW 
prescribed by the Register under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and 
shall be accompanied by the registration fee and deposit required under 
17 U.S.C. 908 and Secs. 211.3 and 211.5 of these regulations. The 
application shall contain the information required by the form and its 
accompanying instructions, and shall include a certification. The 
certification shall consist of:
    (i) A declaration that the applicant is authorized to submit the 
application

[[Page 542]]

and that the statements made are correct to the best of that person's 
knowledge; and
    (ii) The handwritten signature of the applicant, accompanied by the 
typed or printed name of that person.
    (c) One registration per mask work. (1) Subject to the exception 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, only one registration can 
generally be made for the same version of a mask work fixed in an 
intermediate or final form of any semiconductor chip product. However, 
where an applicant for registration alleges that an earlier registration 
for the same version of the work is unauthorized and legally invalid and 
submits for recordation a signed affidavit, a registration may be made 
in the applicant's name.
    (2) Notwithstanding the general rule permitting only one 
registration per work, owners of mask works in final forms of 
semiconductor chip products that are produced by adding metal-connection 
layers to unpersonalized gate arrays may separately register the entire 
unpersonalized gate array and the custom metallization layers. 
Applicants seeking to register separately entire unpersonalized gate 
arrays or custom metallization layers should make the nature of their 
claim clear at Space 8 of application Form MW. For these purposes, an 
``unpersonalized gate array'' is an intermediate form chip product that 
includes a plurality of circuit elements that are adaptable to be 
personalized into a plurality of different final form chip products, in 
which some of the circuit elements are, or will be, connected as gates.
    (d) Registration as a single work. Subject to the exception 
specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for purposes of 
registration on a single application and upon payment of a single fee, 
the following shall be considered a single work.
    (1) In the case of a mask work that has not been commercially 
exploited: All original mask work elements fixed in a particular form of 
a semiconductor chip product at the time an application for registration 
is filed and in which the owner or owners of the mask work is or are the 
same; and
    (2) In the case of a mask work that has been commercially exploited. 
All original mask work elements fixed in a semiconductor chip product at 
the time that product was first commercially exploited and in which the 
owner or owners of the mask is or are the same.
    (e) Registration in most complete form. Owners seeking registration 
of a mask work contribution must submit the entire original mask work 
contribution in its most complete form as fixed in a semiconductor chip 
product. The most complete form means the stage of the manufacturing 
process which is closest to completion. In cases where the owner is 
unable to register on the basis of the most complete form because he or 
she lacks control over the most complete form, an averment of this fact 
must be made at Space 2 of Form MW. Where such an averment is made, the 
owner may register on the basis of the most complete form in his or her 
possession. For applicants seeking to register an unpersonalized gate 
array or custom metallization layers under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section, the most complete form is the entire chip on which the 
unpersonalized gate array or custom metallization layers reside(s), and 
registration covers those elements of the chip in which work protection 
is asserted.
    (f) Corrections and amplifications of prior registration. Except for 
errors or omissions made by the Copyright Office, no corrections or 
amplifications can be made to the information contained in the record of 
a completed registration after the effective date of the registration. A 
document purporting to correct or amplify the information in a completed 
registration may be recorded in the Copyright Office for whatever effect 
a court of competent jurisdiction may later give to it, if the document 
is signed by the owner of the mask work, as identified in the 
registration record, or by a duly authorized agent of the owner.

<R05>
Sec. 211.5  Deposit of identifying material.

    (a) General. This section prescribes rules pertaining to the deposit 
of identifying material for registration of a

[[Page 543]]

claim of protection in a mask work under section 908 of title 17 U.S.C.
    (b) Nature of required deposit. Subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (c) of this section, the deposit of identifying material to 
accompany an application for registration of a mask work claim under 
Sec. 211.4 of these regulations shall consist of:
    (1) In the case of a commercially exploited mask work, four 
reproductions of the mask work fixed in the form of the semiconductor 
chip product in which it was first commercially exploited. Defective 
chips may be deposited under this section provided that the mask work 
contribution would be revealed in reverse dissection of the chips. The 
four reproductions shall be accompanied by a visually perceptible 
representation of each layer of the mask work consisting of:
    (i) Sets of plastic color overlay sheets;
    (ii) Drawings or plots in composite form on a single sheet or on 
separate sheets; or
    (iii) A photograph of each layer of the work fixed in a 
semiconductor chip product.

The visually perceptible representation of a mask work deposited under 
this section shall be reproduced on material which can be readily stored 
in an 8\1/2\ x 11 inch format, and shall be reproduced at a 
magnification sufficient to reveal the basic circuitry design of the 
mask work and which shall in all cases be at least 20 times 
magnification.
    (2) In the case of a mask work that has not been commercially 
exploited, one of the following:
    (i) Where the mask work contribution in which registration is sought 
represents twenty percent or more of the area of the intended final 
form, a visually perceptible representation of the work in accordance 
with paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section. In addition to the 
deposit of visually perceptible representations of the work, an 
applicant may, at his or her option, deposit four reproductions in the 
most complete form of the mask work as fixed in a semiconductor product.
    (ii) Where the mask work contribution in which registration is 
sought represents less than twenty percent of the area of the intended 
final form, a visually perceptible representation of the work which 
reveals the totality of the mask work contribution to a person trained 
in the state of the art. The visually perceptible representations may 
consist of any combination of plastic color overlay sheets, drawing or 
plots in composite form, or a photograph or photographs of the entire 
mask set. If the visually perceptible representation fails to identify 
all of the elements of the mask work contribution, they may be 
accompanied by additional explanatory material. The visually perceptible 
representation of a mask work deposited under this section shall be 
reproduced on material which can be readily stored in an 8\1/2\ x 11 
inch format and shall be of sufficient magnification and completeness to 
reveal all elements of the mask work contribution. In addition to the 
deposit of visually perceptible representations of the work, an 
applicant may, at his or her option, deposit four reproductions in the 
most complete form of the mask work as fixed in a semiconductor chip 
product.
    (c) Trade secret protection. Where specific layers of a mask work 
fixed in a semiconductor chip product contain information in which trade 
secret protection is asserted, certain material may be withheld as 
follows:
    (1) Mask works commercially exploited. For commercially exploited 
mask works no more than two layers of each five or more layers in the 
work. In lieu of the visually perceptible representations required under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, identifying portions of the withheld 
material must be submitted. For these purposes, identifying portions 
shall mean (i) a printout of the mask work design data pertaining to 
each withheld layer, reproduced in microform, or (ii) visually 
perceptible representations in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) (i), 
(ii), or (iii) of this section with those portions containing sensitive 
information maintained under a claim of trade secrecy blocked out, 
provided that the portions remaining are greater than those which are 
blocked out.
    (2) Mask work not commercially exploited. For mask works not 
commercially exploited falling under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this 
section, any layer

[[Page 544]]

may be withheld. In lieu of the visually perceptible representations 
required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, ``identifying 
portions'' shall mean (i) a printout of the mask work design data 
pertaining to each withheld layer, reproduced in microform, in which 
sensitive information maintained under a claim of trade secrecy has been 
blocked out or stripped, or (ii) visually perceptible representations in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section with those portions 
containing sensitive information maintained under a claim of trade 
secrecy blocked out, provided that the portions remaining are greater 
than those which are blocked out. The identifying portions shall be 
accompanied by a single photograph of the top or other visible layers of 
the mask work fixed in a semiconductor chip product in which the 
sensitive information maintained under a claim of trade secrecy has been 
blocked out, provided that the blocked out portions do not exceed the 
remaining portions.
    (d) Special relief. The Register of Copyrights may decide to grant 
special relief from the deposit requirements of this section, and shall 
determine the conditions under which special relief is to be granted., 
Requests for special relief under this paragraph shall be made in 
writing to the Chief, Examining Division of the Copyright Office, 
Washington, DC 20559-6000, shall be signed by the person signing the 
application for registration, shall set forth specific reasons why the 
request should be granted and shall propose an alternative form of 
deposit.
    (e) Retention and disposition of deposits. 1'<ls-thn-eq>(1) Any 
identifying material deposited under this section, including material 
deposited in connection with claims that have been refused registration, 
are the property of the United States Government.
    (2) Where a claim of protection in a mask work is registered in the 
Copyright Office, the identifying material deposited in connection with 
the claim shall be retained under the control of the Copyright Office, 
including retention in Government storage facilities, during the period 
of protection. After that period, it is within the joint discretion of 
the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress to order its 
destruction or other disposition.

Sec. 211.6  Methods of affixation and placement of mask work notice.

    (a) General. (1) This section specifies methods of affixation and 
placement of the mask work notice that will satisfy the notice 
requirement in section 909 of title 17 U.S.C. A notice deemed 
``acceptable'' under this regulation shall be considered to satisfy the 
requirement of that section that it be affixed ``in such manner and 
location as to give reasonable notice'' of protection. As provided in 
that section, the examples specified in this regulation shall not be 
considered exhaustive of the methods of affixation and positions giving 
reasonable notice of the claim of protection in a mask work.
    (2) The acceptability of a mask work notice under these regulations 
shall depend upon its being legible under normal conditions of use, and 
affixed in such manner and position that, when affixed, it may be viewed 
upon reasonable examination.
    (b) Elements of mask work notice. The elements of a mask work notice 
shall consist of:
    (1) The words mask work, the symbol ``M'' or the symbol ``[om]'' 
(the letter M in a circle); and
    (2) The name of the owner or owners of the mask work or an 
abbreviation by which the name is recognized or is generally known.
    (c) Methods of affixation and placement of the notice. In the case 
of a mask work fixed in a semiconductor chip product, the following 
locations are acceptable:
    (1) A gummed or other label securely affixed or imprinted upon the 
package or other container used as a permanent receptacle for the 
product; or
    (2) A notice imprinted or otherwise affixed in or on the top or 
other visible layer of the product.

<R05>
Sec. 212.3  Registration of claims for protection of eligible designs.

    (a) Limitations. Protection is not available for, and an application 
for registration will not be accepted for:
    (1) An otherwise eligible design made public prior to October 28, 
1998;
    (2) An otherwise eligible design made public on a date more than two 
years prior to the filing of an application for registration under this 
section;
    (3) A design ineligible for any of the reasons set forth in 17 
U.S.C. 1302.
    (b) Required elements of application. An application is considered 
filed with the Copyright Office on the date on which the following three 
items have been received by the Copyright Office:
    (1) Completed Form D-VH;
    (2) Deposit material identifying the design or designs for which 
registration is sought; and
    (3) The appropriate fee.
    (c) Application by owner of design. An application for registration 
under this section may be made only by the owner or owners of the 
design, or by the duly authorized agent or representative of the owner 
or owners of the design.
    (d) Application form. Registration must be made on Form D-VH. Forms 
are available from the Copyright Office and may be reprinted from the 
Copyright Office's website (http://www.loc.gov/copyright/forms/
formdvh.pdf).
    (e) Deposit material.--(1) In General. Identification of the design 
to be registered may be made in the form of drawings or photographs. No 
more than two drawings or photographs of the design may appear on a 
single sheet. Applicants may submit up to three 8\1/
2\<gr-thn-eq>x11<gr-thn-eq> sheets containing drawings or photographs as 
part of the basic $75 application fee. The fee for each additional sheet 
beyond three is $20 per sheet. No combinations of drawings and 
photographs may be submitted on a single sheet. The drawings or 
photographs that accompany the application

[[Page 546]]

must reveal those aspects of the design for which protection is claimed. 
The registration extends only to those aspects of the design which are 
adequately shown in the drawings or photographs.
    (2) Views. The drawings or photographs submitted should contain a 
sufficient number of views to make an adequate disclosure of the 
appearance of the design, i.e. front, rear, right and left sides, top 
and bottom. While not required, it is suggested that perspective views 
be submitted to show clearly the appearance and shape of the three 
dimensional designs.
    (3) Drawings. (i) Drawings must be in black ink on white 8\1/
2\<gr-thn-eq>x11<gr-thn-eq> unruled paper. A drawing of a design should 
include appropriate surface shading which shows clearly the character 
and contour of all surfaces of any 3-dimensional aspects of the design. 
Surface shading is also necessary to distinguish between any open and 
solid areas of the design. Solid black surface shading is not permitted 
except when used to represent the black color as well as color contrast.
    (ii) The use of broken lines in drawings depicting the design is 
understood to be for illustrative purposes only and forms no part of the 
claimed design. Structure that is not part of the design, but that is 
considered necessary to show the environment in which the design is 
used, may be represented in the drawing by broken lines. This includes 
any portion of the vessel hull in which the design is embodied or 
applied that is not considered part of the design. When the claimed 
design is only surface ornamentation to the vessel hull, the vessel hull 
in which it is embodied must be shown in broken lines.
    (iii) When broken lines are used, they should not intrude upon or 
cross the depiction of the design and should not be of heavier weight 
than the lines used in depicting the design. Where a broken line showing 
of environmental structure must necessarily cross or intrude upon the 
representation of the design and obscure a clear understanding of the 
design, such an illustration should be included as a separate figure, in 
addition to other figures which fully disclose the subject matter of the 
design.
    (4) Photographs. High quality black and white or color photographs 
will be accepted provided that they are mounted on plain white 8\1/
2\<gr-thn-eq>x11<gr-thn-eq> unlined paper and do not exceed two 
photographs per sheet. Photographs must be developed on double weight 
photographic paper and must be of sufficient quality so that all the 
details of the design are plainly visible and are capable of 
reproduction on the registration certificate, if issued.
    (f) Multiple claims.--(1) In general. Claims for more than one 
design may be filed in one of two ways. If multiple designs are 
contained on a single make and model of a vessel hull (and therefore, 
the information in Space 1 of Form D-VH--the make and model of the 
vessel that embodies the design--is the same for each of the designs), a 
single application form may be used for all designs, provided that the 
information in spaces 3 through 9 is the same for each of the designs. 
If multiple designs are contained on more than one make and model of a 
vessel, or the information in spaces 3 through 9 is not the same for 
each of the multiple designs, then separate applications must be used 
for each design.
    (2) Single application. Where a single application for multiple 
designs is appropriate, a separate Form D-VH/CON must be used for each 
design beyond the first appearing on Form D-VH. Each Form D-VH/CON must 
be accompanied by deposit material identifying the design that is the 
subject of the Form D-VH/CON, and the deposit material must be attached 
to the Form D-VH/CON. The Form D-VH and all the Form D-VH/CONs for the 
single application must be submitted together.
    (3) Multiple applications. Where multiple applications for more than 
one design are required, a Form D-VH must be completed for each design. 
Deposit material identifying the design must accompany each application. 
Multiple applications may be filed separately.
    (4) Fees. The $75 basic application fee applies to each design 
submitted, regardless of whether a single application or multiple 
applications are used.
    (g) Written declaration. In lieu of the oath required by 17 U.S.C. 
1312(a), the

[[Page 547]]

application shall contain a written declaration, as permitted by 17 
U.S.C. 1312(b), signed by the applicant, or the applicant's duly 
authorized agent or representative. If the design has been made public 
with the design notice prescribed in 17 U.S.C. 1306, the written 
declaration shall also describe the exact form and position of the 
design notice. The written declaration shall read as follows:

    The undersigned, as the applicant or the applicant's duly appointed 
agent or representative, being hereby warned that willful false 
statements are punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both, under 18 
U.S.C. 1001, and that such willful false statements may jeopardize the 
validity of this application or any resulting registration, hereby 
declares to the best of his/her knowledge and belief:
    (1) That the design has been fixed in a useful article;
    (2) That the design is original and was created by the designer(s), 
or employer if applicable, named in the application;
    (3) That those aspects of the design for which registration is 
sought are not protected by a design patent;
    (4) That the design has not previously been registered on behalf of 
the applicant or the applicant's predecessor in title; and
    (5) That the applicant is the person entitled to protection and to 
registration under chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code.

    (h) Priority claims. An applicant seeking the benefit of 17 U.S.C. 
1311 because the applicant has, within the previous 6 months, filed an 
application for protection of the same design in a foreign country, must 
provide:
    (1) Identification of the filing date of the foreign application;
    (2) Identification of the foreign country in which the application 
was filed;
    (3) The serial number or any other identifying number of the foreign 
application;
    (4) A certified copy of the foreign application;
    (5) A translation of the foreign application and a statement, signed 
by the translator, that the translation is accurate, if the foreign 
application is in a language other than English; and
    (6) If requested by the Copyright Office, proof that the foreign 
country in which the prior application was filed extends to designs of 
owners who are citizens of the United States, or to applications filed 
under chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code, similar protection to 
that provided under chapter 13 of title 17, United States Code.
    (i) Effective date of registration. The effective date of 
registration is the date of publication of the registration by the 
Copyright Office.
    (j) Publication of registration. Publication of registrations of 
vessel hull designs shall be made on the Copyright Office website 
(http://www.loc.gov/copyright/vessels).


<R05>
Sec. 212.4  Affixation and placement of design notice.

    (a) General. (1) This section specifies the methods of affixation 
and placement of the design notice required by 17 U.S.C. 1306. Sections 
1306 and 1307 govern the circumstances under which a design notice must 
be used and the effect of omission of a design notice. A notice deemed 
acceptable under this part shall be considered to satisfy the 
requirements of section 1306 that it be so located and applied as to 
give reasonable notice of design protection while the useful article 
embodying the design is passing through its normal channels of commerce. 
As provided in that section, the examples specified in this part shall 
not be considered exhaustive of the methods of affixation and locations 
giving reasonable notice of the claim of protection in the design.
    (2) The acceptability of a design notice under these regulations 
shall depend upon its being legible under normal conditions of use, and 
affixed in such a manner and position that, when affixed, it may be 
viewed upon reasonable examination. There is no requirement that a 
design notice be permanently embossed or engraved into a vessel hull or 
deck, but it should be affixed in such a manner that, under normal 
conditions of use, it is not likely to become unattached or illegible.
    (b) Elements of a design notice. If the design has been registered, 
the registration number may be included in the design notice in place of 
the year of the date on which protection for the design commenced and 
the name of the owner, an abbreviation by which the name can be 
recognized, or a generally accepted alternative designation of the 
owner. The elements of a design notice shall consist of:

[[Page 548]]

    (1) The words ``Protected Design'', the abbreviation ``Prot'd 
Des.'', or the letter ``D'' within a circle, or the symbol *D*;
    (2) The year of the date on which protection for the design 
commenced; and
    (3) The name of the owner, an abbreviation by which the name can be 
recognized, or a generally accepted alternative designation of the 
owner.
    (c) Distinctive identification. Any distinctive identification of an 
owner may be used for purposes of paragraph (b)(3) of this section if it 
has been recorded by the Register of Copyrights pursuant to Sec. 212.5 
before the design marked with such identification is registered.
    (d) Acceptable locations of notice. The following are acceptable 
means of affixing and placement of a design notice:
    (1) In close proximity to the hull identification number required by 
33 CFR 181.23;
    (2) In close proximity to the driver's console such that it is in 
plain view from the console;
    (3) If the vessel is twenty feet in length or less and is governed 
by 33 CFR 183.21, in close proximity to the capacity marking; and
    (4) In close proximity to the make and/or model designation of the 
vessel.


<R05>
Sec. 212.5  Recordation of distinctive identification of vessel hull designer.

    (a) General. Any owner of a vessel hull may record a distinctive 
identification with the Register of Copyrights for purposes of using 
such distinctive identification in a design protection notice required 
by 17 U.S.C. 1306. A distinctive identification of an owner may not be 
used in a design notice before it has first been recorded with the 
Register.
    (b) Forms. The Copyright Office does not provide forms for the use 
of persons recording distinctive identifications of ownership of a 
vessel hull. However, persons recording distinctive identifications are 
encouraged to use the suggested format available on the Copyright Office 
website (http://www.loc.gov/copyright/vessels).
    (c) Recording distinctive identifications. Any distinctive 
identification of an owner of a vessel hull may be recorded with the 
Register of Copyrights provided that a document containing the following 
is submitted:
    (1) The name and address of the owner;
    (2) A statement of the owner that he/she is entitled to use the 
distinctive identification;
    (3) A statement or depiction of the identification; and
    (4) A recordation fee of $80.
    (d) The document should be mailed to: Dept. D-VH, Vessel Hull 
Registration, P.O. Box 71380, Washington, DC 20024-1380.

[64 FR 36578, July 7, 1999, as amended at 67 FR 38005, May 31, 2002]


<R05>
Sec. 212.6  Recordation of transfers and other documents.

    The conditions prescribed in Sec. 201.4 of this chapter for 
recordation of transfers of copyright ownership and other documents 
pertaining to copyright are applicable to the recordation of documents 
pertaining to design protection of vessel hulls under 17 U.S.C. chapter 
13.

referred to in this subchapter. With respect to persons on the

for each person claimed to be objectionable.
    (b) In the case of a royalty distribution proceeding, any party to 
the proceeding may, during the 45-day period specified in 
Sec. 251.45(b)(1)(i), file an objection with the Librarian of Congress 
to one or more of the persons contained on the arbitrator list for the

[59 FR 23981, May 9, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 63717, Dec. 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 251.6  Composition and selection of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels.

    (a) Within ten days after publication of a notice in the Federal 
Register initiating arbitration proceedings under this subchapter, the 
Librarian of Congress will, upon recommendation of the Register of 
Copyrights, select two arbitrators from the arbitrator list for that 
calendar year.
    (b) The two arbitrators so selected shall, within ten days of their 
selection, choose a third arbitrator from the same arbitrator list. The 
third arbitrator shall serve as the chairperson of the panel during the 
course of the proceedings.
    (c) If the two arbitrators fail to agree upon the selection of the 
third, the Librarian will promptly select the third arbitrator from the 
same arbitrator list.
    (d) The third arbitrator so chosen shall serve as the chairperson of 
the panel during the course of the proceeding. In all matters, 
procedural or substantive, the chairperson shall act according to the 
majority wishes of the panel.
    (e) Two arbitrators shall constitute a quorum necessary to the 
determination of any proceeding.
    (f) If, before the commencement of hearings in a proceeding, one or 
more of the arbitrators is unable to continue service on the CARP, the 
Librarian will suspend the proceeding as provided by Sec. 251.8, and 
will inaugurate a procedure to bring the CARP up to the full complement 
of three arbitrators. Where one or two vacancies exist, and either or 
both of the vacant seats were previously occupied by arbitrators 
selected by the Librarian, the Librarian will select the necessary 
replacements from the current arbitrator list. If there is one vacancy, 
and it was previously occupied by the chairperson, the two remaining 
arbitrators shall select the replacement from the arbitrator list, and 
the person chosen shall serve as chairperson. If there are two vacant 
seats, and one of them was previously occupied by the chairperson, the 
Librarian will select one replacement from the arbitrator list, and that 
person shall join with the remaining arbitrator to choose the 
replacement, who shall serve as chairperson.
    (g) After hearings have commenced, the Librarian will not suspend 
the proceedings or inaugurate a replacement procedure unless it is 
necessary in order for the CARP to have a quorum.

[[Page 552]]

If the hearing is underway and two arbitrators are unable to continue 
service, or if the hearing had been proceeding with two arbitrators and 
one of them is no longer able to serve, the Librarian will suspend the 
proceedings under Sec. 251.8 and seek the unanimous written agreement of 
the parties to the proceeding for the Librarian to select a replacement. 
In the absence of such an agreement, the Librarian will terminate the 
proceeding. If such agreement is obtained, the Librarian will select one 
arbitrator from the arbitrator list.
    (h) If, after hearings have commenced, the chairperson of the CARP 
is no longer able to serve, the Librarian will ask the two remaining 
arbitrators, or the one remaining arbitrator and the newly-selected 
arbitrator, to agree between themselves which of them will serve as 
chairperson. In the absence of such an agreement, the Librarian will 
terminate the proceeding.

[59 FR 23981, May 9, 1994, as amended at 63 FR 30635, June 5, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 251.7  Actions of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels.

    Any action of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel requiring 
publication in the Federal Register according to 17 U.S.C. or the rules 
and regulations of this subchapter shall be published under the 
authority of the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights. 
Under no circumstances shall a CARP engage in rulemaking designed to 
amend, supplement, or supersede any of the rules and regulations of this 
subchapter, or seek to have any such action published in the Federal 
Register.


<R05>
Sec. 251.8  Suspension of proceedings.

    (a) Where it becomes necessary to replace a selected arbitrator 
under Sec. 251.6 or to remove and replace a selected arbitrator under 
subpart D of this part, the Librarian will order a suspension of any 
ongoing hearing or other proceeding by notice in writing to all parties. 
Immediately after issuing the order of suspension, and without delay, 
the Librarian will take the necessary steps to replace the arbitrator or 
arbitrators, and upon such replacement will issue an order, by notice in 
writing to all parties, resuming the proceeding from the time and point 
at which it was suspended.
    (b) Where, for any other reason, such as a serious medical or family 
emergency affecting an arbitrator, the Librarian considers a suspension 
of a proceeding necessary and fully justified, he may, with the 
unanimous written consent of all parties to the proceeding, order a 
suspension of the proceeding for a stated period not to exceed one 
month.
    (c) Any suspension under this section shall result in a complete 
cessation of all aspects of the proceeding, including the running of any 
period provided by statute for the completion of the proceeding.


<R04>
Subpart B--Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings


<R05>
Sec. 251.11  Open meetings.

open to the public, with the exception of meetings that are listed in 
Sec. 251.13.
    (b) At the beginning of each proceeding, the CARP shall develop the 
original schedule of the proceeding which shall be published in the 
Federal Register at least seven calendar days in advance of the first 
meeting. Such announcement shall state the times, dates, and place of 
the meetings, the testimony to be heard, whether any of the meetings, or 
any portion of a meeting, is to be closed, and, if so, which ones, and 
the name and telephone number of the person to contact for further 
information.
    (c) If changes are made to the original schedule, they will be 
announced in open meeting and issued as orders to the parties 
participating in the proceeding, and the changes will be noted in the

In addition, the contact person for the proceeding shall make any 
additional efforts to publicize the change as are practicable.
    (d) If it is decided that the publication of the original schedule 
must be made on shorter notice than seven days, that decision must be 
made by a

[[Page 553]]

recorded vote of the panel and included in the announcement.

<R05>
Sec. 251.12  Conduct of open meetings.

    Meetings of a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel will be conducted 
in a manner to ensure the greatest degree of openness possible. 
Reasonable access for the public will be provided at all public 
sessions. Any person may take photographs, and make audio or video 
recordings of the proceedings, so long as the panel is informed in 
advance. The chairperson has the discretion to regulate the time, place, 
and manner of the taking of photographs or the audio or video recording 
of the proceedings to ensure the order and decorum of the proceedings. 
The right of the public to be present does not include the right to 
participate or make comments.


<R05>
Sec. 251.13  Closed meetings.

    In the following circumstances, a Copyright Arbitration Royalty 
Panel may close meetings, or any portion of a meeting, or withhold 
information from the public:
    (a) If the matter to be discussed has been specifically authorized 
to be kept secret by Executive Order, in the interests of national 
defense or foreign policy; or
    (b) If the matter relates solely to the internal practices of a 
Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel; or
    (c) If the matter has been specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552) and there is no discretion on the 
issue; or
    (d) If the matter involves privileged or confidential trade secrets 
or financial information; or
    (e) If the result might be to accuse any person of a crime or 
formally censure him or her; or
    (f) If there would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy; or
    (g) If there would be disclosure of investigatory records compiled 
for law enforcement, or information that if written would be contained 
in such records, and to the extent disclosure would:
    (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings; or
    (2) Deprive a person of the right to a fair trial or impartial 
adjudication; or
    (3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; or
    (4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source or, in the case 
of a criminal investigation or a national security intelligence 
investigation, disclose confidential information furnished only by a 
confidential source; or
    (5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or
    (6) Endanger the life or safety of law enforcement personnel.
    (h) If premature disclosure of the information would frustrate a 
Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel's action, unless the panel has 
already disclosed the concept or nature of the proposed action, or is 
required by law to make disclosure before taking final action; or
    (i) If the matter concerns a CARP's participation in a civil action 
or proceeding or in an action in a foreign court or international 
tribunal, or an arbitration, or a particular case of formal agency 
adjudication pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554, or otherwise involving a 
determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing; or
    (j) If a motion or objection has been raised in an open meeting and 
the panel determines that it is in the best interests of the proceeding 
to deliberate on such motion or objection in closed session.

[59 FR 23981, May 9, 1994, as amended at 59 63040, Dec. 7, 1994; 60 FR 
8197, Feb. 13, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 251.14  Procedure for closed meetings.

    (a) Meetings may be closed, or information withheld from the public, 
only by a recorded vote of a majority of arbitrators of a Copyright 
Arbitration Royalty Panel. Each question, either to close a meeting or 
to withhold information, must be voted on separately, unless a series of 
meetings is involved, in which case the CARP may vote to keep the 
discussions closed for 30 days, starting from the first meetings. If the 
CARP feels that information about a closed meeting must be withheld, the 
decision to do so must also be the subject of a recorded vote.
    (b) Before a discussion to close a meeting or withhold information, 
the

[[Page 554]]

chairperson of a CARP must certify that such an action is permissible, 
and the chairperson shall cite the appropriate exemption under 
Sec. 251.13. This certification shall be included in the announcement of 
the meeting and be maintained as part of the record of proceedings of 
that CARP.
    (c) Following such a vote, the following information shall be 
published in the Federal Register as soon as possible:
    (1) The vote of each arbitrator; and
    (2) The appropriate exemption under Sec. 251.13; and
    (3) A list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their 
affiliation.
    (d) The procedure for closed meetings in this section and in 
Sec. 251.15 shall not apply to the internal deliberations of arbitrators 
carried out in furtherance of their duties and obligations under this 
chapter.

[59 FR 23981, May 9, 1994, as amended at 59 63040, Dec. 7, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 251.15  Transcripts of closed meetings.

    (a) All meetings closed to the public shall be subject either to a 
complete transcript or, in the case of Sec. 251.13(h) and at the 
discretion of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, detailed minutes. 
Detailed minutes shall describe all matters discussed, identify all 
documents considered, summarize action taken as well as the reasons for 
it, and record all roll call votes as well as any views expressed.
    (b) Such transcripts or minutes shall be kept by the Copyright 
Office for at least two years, or for at least one year after the 
conclusion of the proceedings, whichever is later. Any portion of 
transcripts of meetings which the chairperson of a CARP does not feel is 
exempt from disclosure under Sec. 251.13 will ordinarily be available to 
the public within 20 working days of the meeting. Transcripts or minutes 
of closed meetings will be reviewed by the chairperson at the end of the 
proceedings of the panel and, if at that time the chairperson determines 
that they should be disclosed, he or she will resubmit the question to 
the CARP to gain authorization for their disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 251.16  Requests to open or close meetings.

    (a) Any person may request a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel to 
open or close a meeting or disclose or withhold information. Such 
request must be captioned ``Request to Open'' or ``Request to Close'' a 
meeting on a specified date concerning a specific subject. The person

list'' published in accordance with Sec. 251.3 of these regulations.
    (b) General principles applicable to arbitrators. Selected 
arbitrators are persons acting on behalf of the United States, and the 
following general principles apply to them. Where a situation is not

<R05>
Sec. 251.31  Financial interests.

    (a) No selected arbitrator shall have a direct or indirect financial 
interest--
    (1) In the case of a distribution proceeding, in any claimant to the 
proceeding whether or not in a voluntary settlement agreement, or any 
copyright owner who receives royalties from such claimants because of 
their representation;
    (2) In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, in any individual, 
organization or entity that would be affected by the outcome of the 
proceeding.
    (b) ``Direct or indirect financial interest'' shall include: Being 
employed by, being a consultant to, being a representative or agent for, 
being a member or affiliate of, being a partner of, holding any office 
in, owning any stocks, bonds, or other securities, or deriving any 
income from the prohibited entity.
    (c) ``Direct or indirect financial interest'' shall not include--
    (1) Owning shares in any stock or bond mutual fund or blind trust 
which might have an interest in a prohibited entity but whose decisions 
to invest or sell is not under the control of the selected arbitrator, 
or
    (2) Receiving any post-employment benefit such as health insurance 
or a pension so long as the benefit would not be affected by the outcome 
of the proceeding.
    (d) For the purposes of this section, the financial interests of the 
following persons will serve to disqualify the selected arbitrator to 
the same extent as if they were the arbitrator's own interests:
    (1) The arbitrator's spouse;
    (2) The arbitrator's minor child;
    (3) The arbitrator's general partner, except that the personal 
financial holdings, including stock and bond investments, of such 
partner will not serve to disqualify the selected arbitrator; or
    (4) An organization or entity for which the arbitrator serves as 
officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee.

[59 FR 23981, May 9, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 63040, Dec. 7, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 251.32  Financial disclosure statement.

    (a) Within 45 days of their nomination, each nominated arbitrator 
shall file with the Librarian of Congress a confidential financial 
disclosure statement as provided by the Library of Congress, which 
statement shall be reviewed by the Librarian and designated Library 
staff to determine what conflicts of interest, if any, exist according 
to Sec. 251.31.
    (b) If any conflicts do exist, the Librarian shall not choose that 
person for the proceeding for which he or she has the financial 
conflict, except--
    (1) The listed arbitrator may divest himself or herself of the 
interest that caused the disqualification, and become qualified to 
serve; or

[[Page 557]]

    (2) The listed arbitrator may offer to disclose on the record the 
conflict of interest causing disqualification. In such instances:
    (i) The Librarian shall publish a list detailing the conflicts of 
interest the listed arbitrators have offered to disclose, and any other 
matters which, although outside of the scope of the restrictions of 
Sec. 251.31, nevertheless, in the view of the Librarian, raise 
sufficient concerns to warrant disclosure to the affected parties;
    (ii) Such list shall be included in an order issued no later than 
the commencement of the 45-day precontroversy discovery period;
    (iii) Such list shall contain the matters of concern, but shall not 
contain the names of the listed arbitrators.
    (iv) Any party to the proceeding for which the listed arbitrator is 
being considered may interpose within the 45-day period described in 
Sec. 251.45(b) an objection to that arbitrator being selected. If the 
objection is raised to a matter found to be within the scope of 
Sec. 251.31, the objection will serve automatically to disqualify the 
arbitrator. If the objection is raised to a matter found to be outside 
the scope of Sec. 251.31, the objection will be taken into account when 
the Librarian makes his or her selection, but will not serve 
automatically to disqualify the arbitrator.
    (c) At such time as the two selected arbitrators choose a third 
arbitrator, they shall consult with the Librarian to determine if any 
conflicts of interest exist for the third arbitrator. If, in the opinion 
of the Librarian of Congress, any conflicts of interest do exist, the 
two selected arbitrators shall be asked to choose another arbitrator who 
has no conflict of interest.
    (d) Within one week of the selection of the CARP, the three selected 
arbitrators shall file with the Librarian an updated confidential 
financial disclosure form or, if there are no changes in the 
arbitrator's financial interests, a statement to that effect. If any 
conflicts of interest are revealed on the updated form, the Librarian 
will suspend the proceeding and replace the selected arbitrator with 
another arbitrator from the arbitrator list in accordance with the 
provision of Sec. 251.6.
    (e) During the following periods of time, the selected arbitrators 
shall be obliged to inform the Librarian immediately of any change in 
their financial interests that would reasonably raise a conflict of 
interest--
    (1) During the period beginning with the filing of the updated 
disclosure form or statement required by paragraph (d) of this section 
and ending with the submission of the panel's report to the Librarian, 
and
    (2) If the same arbitrator or arbitrators are recalled to serve 
following a court-ordered remand, during the time the panel is 
reconvened.
    (f) If the Librarian determines that an arbitrator has failed to 
give timely notice of a financial interest constituting a conflict of 
interest, or that the arbitrator in fact has a conflict of interest, the 
Librarian shall remove that arbitrator from the proceeding.

Librarian of Congress or the Register of Copyrights on the merit or 
status of any matter, procedural or substantive, relating to the 
distribution of royalty fees, the adjustment of royalty rates or the

cause someone else to engage in, ex parte communications with the 
selected arbitrators in a proceeding for any reason whatsoever from the 
time of their selection to the time of the submission of their report to

reconvening to the time of their submission of their report to the 
Librarian. Incidental communications unrelated to any proceeding, such 
as an exchange

[[Page 558]]

of pleasantries, shall not be deemed to constitute an ex parte 
communication.
    (c) Listed arbitrators. No interested person shall engage in, or 
cause someone else to engage in, ex parte communications with any person 
listed by the Librarian of Congress as qualified to serve as an 
arbitrator about the merits of any past, pending, or future proceeding 
relating to the distribution of royalty fees or the adjustment of 
royalty rates. This prohibition applies during any period when the 
individual appears on a current arbitrator list.
    (d) Library and Copyright Office personnel. No person outside the 
Library of Congress (including the Copyright Office staff) shall engage 
in ex parte communications with any employee of the Library of Congress 
about the substantive merits of any past, pending, or future proceeding 
relating to the distribution of royalty fees or the adjustment of 
royalty rates. This prohibition does not apply to procedural inquiries 
such as scheduling, filing requirements, status requests, or requests 
for public information.
    (e) Outside contacts. The Librarian of Congress, the Register of 
Copyrights, the selected arbitrators, the listed arbitrators, and the 
employees of the Library of Congress described in paragraphs (a) through 
(d) of this section, shall not initiate or continue the prohibited 
communications that apply to them.
    (f) Responsibilities of recipients of communication. (1) Whoever 
receives a prohibited communication shall immediately end it and place

    (i) All such written or recorded communications;
    (ii) Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral 
communications; and
    (iii) All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of 
all oral responses, to the materials described in paragraphs (f)(1) (i) 
and (ii) of this section.
    (2) The materials described in this paragraph (f) shall not be 
considered part of the record for the purposes of decision unless 
introduced into evidence by one of the parties.
    (g) Action by Librarian. When notice of a prohibited communication 
described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section has been placed 
in the record of a proceeding, either the Librarian of Congress or the 
CARP may require the party causing the prohibited communication to show 
cause why his or her claim or interest in the proceeding should not be 
dismissed, denied, or otherwise adversely affected.

    (a) Selected arbitrators. From the time of selection to the time of 
the submission of the arbitration panel's report, whether during the 
initial proceeding or during a court-ordered remand, no selected 
arbitrator shall solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, 
gratuity, favor, travel, entertainment, service, loan, or any other 
thing of monetary value from a person or organization that has an 
interest that would be affected by the outcome of the proceeding, 
regardless of whether the offer was intended to affect the outcome of 
the proceeding.
    (b) Listed arbitrators. No listed arbitrator shall solicit or 
accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, travel, 
entertainment, service, loan, or any other thing of monetary value from

which the arbitrator might be selected, regardless of whether the offer 
was intended to affect the outcome of the proceeding, except--
    (1) A listed arbitrator may accept unsolicited gifts having an 
aggregate market value of $20 or less per occasion, as long as the 
aggregate market value of individual gifts received from any one source 
does not exceed $50 in a calendar year, or
    (2) A listed arbitrator may accept a gift given under circumstances 
in which it is clear that the gift is motivated by a family relationship 
or personal friendship rather than the potential of the listed 
arbitrator to decide a future proceeding.
    (c) A gift that is solicited or accepted indirectly includes a gift-
-
    (1) Given with the arbitrator's knowledge and acquiescence to the 
arbitrator's parent, sibling, spouse, child, or

cause a reasonable person to question the arbitrator's ability to render 
an impartial decision;
    (2) Accept any speaking engagement, whether paid or unpaid, related 
to the proceeding or sponsored by a party that would be affected by the 
outcome of the proceeding; or

by a party who would be affected by the outcome of the proceeding.
    (b) Honoraria indirectly paid include payments--
    (1) Given with the arbitrator's knowledge and acquiescence to the 
arbitrator's parent, sibling, spouse, child, or dependent relative

specification by the arbitrator.


<R05>
Sec. 251.36  Pre-arbitration and post-arbitration employment restrictions.

employed at any time during the period of five years immediately 
preceding the date of that arbitrator's selection by any party to, or 
any person, organization or entity with a financial interest in, the 
proceeding for which he or she is being considered. However, a listed 
arbitrator may disclose on the record the past employment causing 
disqualification and may ask the parties to consider whether to allow 
him or her to serve in the proceeding, in which case any agreement by 
the parties to allow the listed arbitrator to serve shall be unanimous 
and shall be incorporated into the record of the proceeding.
    (b) No arbitrator may arrange for future employment with any party 
to, or any person, organization, or entity with a financial interest in, 
the proceeding in which he or she is serving.
    (c) For a period of three years from the date of submission of the 
arbitration panel's report to the Librarian, no arbitrator may enter 
into employment with any party to, or any person, organization, or 
entity with a financial interest in, the particular proceeding in which 
he or she served.
    (d) For purposes of this section, ``employed'' or ``employment'' 
means any business relationship involving the provision of personal 
services including, but not limited to, personal services as an officer, 
director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general 
partner or trustee, but does not include serving as an arbitrator, 
mediator, or neutral engaged in alternative dispute resolution.


<R05>

the arbitration panel has ruled to be confidential in nature.
    (b) Unless required by law, no arbitrator shall disclose in any 
manner--
    (1) Intra-panel communications or communications between the Library

    (a) The formal hearings that will be conducted under the rules of 
this subpart are rate adjustment hearings and royalty fee distribution

distribution proceedings, or during the 45-day period specified in 
Sec. 251.45(b)(2)(i) for rate adjustment proceedings, as appropriate, 
any party may petition the Librarian of Congress to dispense with formal 
hearings, and have the CARP decide the controversy or rate adjustment on 
the basis of written pleadings. The petition may be granted if--
    (1) The controversy or rate adjustment, as appropriate, does not 
involve any genuine issue of material fact; or
    (2) All parties to the proceeding agree, in writing, that a grant of 
the petition is appropriate.

Sec. 251.42  Suspension or waiver of rules.

    For purposes of an individual proceeding, the provisions of this 
subpart may be suspended or waived, in whole or in part, by a Copyright 
Arbitration Royalty Panel upon a showing of good cause, subject to the 
provisions of Sec. 251.7. Such suspension or waiver shall apply only to 
the proceeding of the CARP taking that action, and shall not be binding 
on any other panel or proceeding. Where procedures have not been 
specifically prescribed in this subpart, and subject to Sec. 251.7, the 
panel shall follow procedures consistent with 5 U.S.C. chapter 5, 
subchapter II.


<R05>
Sec. 251.43  Written cases.

direct case. Complete testimony of each witness whose testimony is 
designated (i.e., direct, cross and redirect) must be referenced.
    (d) In the case of a royalty fee distribution proceeding, each party 
must state in the written direct case its percentage or dollar claim to 
the fund. In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, each party must 
state its requested rate. No party will be precluded from revising its 
claim or its requested rate at any time during the proceeding up to the 
filing of the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
    (e) No evidence, including exhibits, may be submitted in the written 
direct case without a sponsoring witness, except where the CARP has 
taken official notice, or in the case of incorporation by reference of 
past records, or for good cause shown.
    (f) Written rebuttal cases of the parties shall be filed at a time 
designated by a CARP upon conclusion of the hearing of the direct case, 
in the same form and manner as the direct case, except that the claim or 
the requested rate shall not have to be included if it has not changed 
from the direct case.

Sec. 251.44  Filing and service of written cases and pleadings.

    (a) Filing of pleadings. In a royalty fee distribution proceeding or 
in a rate adjustment proceeding, the submitting party shall deliver an 
original and five copies of all filings to the Copyright Office at the 
address listed in Sec. 251.1, unless otherwise instructed by the 
Librarian of Congress or the CARP. The Copyright Office will make 
further distribution to the CARP, as necessary. In no case shall a party 
tender any written case or pleading by facsimile transmission.
    (b) Exhibits. All exhibits must be included with a party's case; 
however, in the case of exhibits whose bulk or whose cost of 
reproduction would unnecessarily encumber the record or burden the 
party, the Librarian of Congress or the CARP may reduce the number of 
required copies. Nevertheless, a complete copy must still be submitted 
to the Copyright Office.
    (c) English language translations. In all filings with a CARP or the 
Librarian of Congress, each submission that

[[Page 562]]

is in a language other than English shall be accompanied by an English-
language translation, duly verified under oath to be a true translation. 
Any other party to the proceeding may, in response, submit its own 
English-language translation, similarly verified.
    (d) Affidavits. The testimony of each witness in a party's written 
case, direct or rebuttal, shall be accompanied by an affidavit or a 
declaration made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 supporting the testimony.
    (e) Subscription and verification. (1) The original of all documents 
filed by any party represented by counsel shall be signed by at least 
one attorney of record and shall list the attorney's address and 
telephone number. All copies shall be conformed. Except for English-
language translations, written cases, or when otherwise required, 
documents signed by the attorney for a party need not be verified or 
accompanied by an affidavit. The signature of an attorney constitutes 
certification that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief there 
is good ground to support the document, and that it has not been 
interposed for purposes of delay.
    (2) The original of all documents filed by a party not represented 
by counsel shall be signed by that party and list that party's address 
and telephone number.
    (3) The original of a document that is not signed, or is signed with 
the intent to defeat the purpose of this section, may be stricken as 
sham and false, and the matter shall proceed as though the document had 
not been filed.
    (f) Service. The Librarian of Congress shall compile and distribute 
to those parties who have filed a notice of intent to participate, the 
official service list of the proceeding, which shall be composed of the 
names and addresses of the representatives of all the parties to the 
proceeding. In all filings, a copy shall be served upon counsel of all 
other parties identified in the service list, or, if the party is 
unrepresented by counsel, upon the party itself. Proof of service shall 
accompany the filing. Parties shall notify the Librarian of any change 
in the name or address to which service shall be made, and shall serve a 
copy of such notification on all parties and the CARP.
    (g) Oppositions and replies. Except as otherwise provided in this 
part or by the Librarian of Congress or a CARP, oppositions to motions 
shall be filed within seven business days of the filing of the motion, 
and replies to oppositions shall be filed within five business days of 
the filing of the opposition. Each party must serve all motions, 
petitions, objections, oppositions, and replies on the other parties or 
their counsel by means no slower than overnight express mail on the same 
day the pleading is filed.

<R05>
Sec. 251.45  Discovery and prehearing motions.

    (a) Request for comment, notice of intention to participate. In the 
case of a royalty fee distribution proceeding, the Librarian of Congress 
shall, after the time period for filing claims, publish in the Federal 
Register a notice requesting each claimant on the claimant list to 
negotiate with each other a settlement of their differences, and to 
comment by a date certain as to the existence of controversies with 
respect to the royalty funds described in the notice. Such notice shall 
also establish a date certain by which parties wishing to participate in 
the proceeding must file with the Librarian a notice of intention to 
participate. In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, the Librarian 
of Congress shall, after receiving a petition for rate adjustment filed 
under Sec. 251.62, or, in the case of noncommercial educational 
broadcasting and satellite carrier, prior to the commencement of 
proceedings, publish in the Federal Register a notice requesting 
interested parties to comment on the petition for rate adjustment. Such 
notice shall also establish a date certain by which parties wishing to 
participate in the proceeding must file with the Librarian a notice of 
intention to participate.
    (b) Precontroversy discovery, filing of written cases, scheduling. 
(1)(i) In the case of a royalty fee distribution proceeding, the 
Librarian of Congress shall, after the filing of comments and

[[Page 563]]

notices described in paragraph (a) of this section, designate a 45-day 
period for precontroversy discovery and exchange of documents. The 
period will begin with the exchange of written direct cases among the 
parties to the proceeding. Each party to the proceeding must effect 
actual delivery of a complete copy of its written direct case on each of 
the other parties to the proceeding no later than the first day of the 
45-day period. At any time during the 45-day period, any party to the 
proceeding may file with the Librarian prehearing motions and 
objections, including petitions to dispense with formal hearings under 
Sec. 251.41(b) and objections to arbitrators appearing on the arbitrator 
list under Sec. 251.4. Responses to motions, petitions, and objections 
must be filed with the Librarian within seven business days from the 
filing of such motions, petitions, and objections. Replies to the 
responses shall be filed within five business days from the filing of 
such responses with the Librarian. Each party must serve all motions, 
petitions, objections, oppositions, and replies on the other parties or 
their counsel by means no slower than overnight express mail on the same 
day the pleading is filed.
    (ii) Subject to Sec. 251.72, the Librarian shall establish, prior to 
the commencement of the 45-day period, the date on which arbitration 
proceedings will be initiated.
    (2)(i) In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, the Librarian of 
Congress shall, after the filing of comments and notices described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, designate a 45-day period for 
precontroversy discovery and exchange of documents. The period will 
begin with the exchange of written direct cases among the parties to the 
proceeding. Each party to the proceeding must effect actual delivery of 
a complete copy of its written direct case on each of the other parties 
to the proceeding no later than the first day of the 45-day period. At 
any time during the 45-day period, any party to the proceeding may file 
with the Librarian prehearing motions and objections, including 
petitions to dispense with formal hearings under Sec. 251.41(b) and 
objections to arbitrators appearing on the arbitrator list under 
Sec. 251.4. Responses to motions, petitions, and objections must be 
filed with the Librarian within seven business days from the filing of 
such motions, petitions, and objections. Replies to the responses shall 
be filed within five business days from the filing of such responses 
with the Librarian. Each party must serve all motions, petitions, 
objections, oppositions, and replies on the other parties or their 
counsel by means no slower than overnight express mail on the same day 
the pleading is filed.
    (ii) Subject to Sec. 251.64, the Librarian shall establish, prior to 
the commencement of the 45-day period, the date on which arbitration 
proceedings will be initiated.
    (c) Discovery and motions filed with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty 
Panel. (1) A Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel shall designate a 
period following the filing of written direct and rebuttal cases with it 
in which parties may request of an opposing party nonprivileged 
underlying documents related to the written exhibits and testimony.
    (2) After the filing of written cases with a CARP, any party may 
file with a CARP objections to any portion of another party's written 
case on any proper ground including, without limitation, relevance, 
competency, and failure to provide underlying documents. If an objection 
is apparent from the face of a written case, that objection must be 
raised or the party may thereafter be precluded from raising such an 
objection.
    (d) Amended filings and discovery. In the case of objections filed 
with either the Librarian of Congress or a CARP, each party may amend 
its claim, petition, written case, or direct evidence to respond to the 
objections raised by other parties, or to the requests of either the 
Librarian or a panel. Such amendments must be properly filed with the 
Librarian or the CARP, wherever appropriate, and exchanged with all 
parties. All parties shall be given a reasonable opportunity to conduct 
discovery on the amended filings.

<R05>
Sec. 251.46  Conduct of hearings: Role of arbitrators.

    (a) At the opening of a hearing conducted by a Copyright Arbitration 
Royalty Panel, the chairperson shall announce the subject under 
consideration.
    (b) Only the arbitrators of a CARP, or counsel as provided in this 
chapter, shall question witnesses.
    (c) Subject to the vote of the CARP, the chairperson shall have 
responsibility for:
    (1) Setting the order of presentation of evidence and appearance of 
witnesses;
    (2) Administering oaths and affirmations to all witnesses;
    (3) Announcing the CARP's ruling on objections and motions and all 
rulings with respect to introducing or excluding documentary or other 
evidence. In all cases, whether there are an even or odd number of 
arbitrators sitting at the hearing, it takes a majority vote to grant a 
motion or sustain an objection. A split vote will result in the denial 
of the motion or the overruling of the objection;
    (4) Regulating the course of the proceedings and the decorum of the 
parties and their counsel, and insuring that the proceedings are fair 
and impartial; and
    (5) Announcing the schedule of subsequent hearings.
    (d) Each arbitrator may examine any witness or call upon any party 
for the production of additional evidence at any time. Further 
examination, cross-examination, or redirect examination by counsel 
relevant to the inquiry initiated by an arbitrator may be allowed by a 
CARP, but only to the limited extent that it is directly responsive to 
the inquiry of the arbitrator.

[59 FR 23981, May 9, 1994, as amended at 63 FR 30635, June 5, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 251.47  Conduct of hearings: Witnesses and counsel.

    (a) With all due regard for the convenience of the witnesses, 
proceedings shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible.
    (b) In each distribution or rate adjustment proceeding, each party 
may present its opening statement with the presentation of its direct 
case.
    (c) All witnesses shall be required to take an oath or affirmation 
before testifying; however, attorneys who do not appear as witnesses 
shall not be required to do so.
    (d) Witnesses shall first be examined by their attorney and by 
opposing attorneys for their competency to support their written 
testimony and exhibits (voir dire).
    (e) Witnesses may then summarize, highlight or read their testimony. 
However, witnesses may not materially supplement or alter their written 
testimony except to correct it, unless the CARP expands the witness's 
testimony to complete the record.
    (f) Parties are entitled to raise objections to evidence on any 
proper ground during the course of the hearing, including an objection 
that an opposing party has not furnished nonprivileged underlying 
documents. However, they may not raise objections that were apparent 
from the face of a written case and could have been raised before the 
hearing without leave from the CARP. See Sec. 251.45(c).
    (g) All written testimony and exhibits will be received into the 
record, except any to which the panel sustains an objection; no separate 
motion will be required.
    (h) If the panel rejects or excludes testimony and an offer of proof 
is made, the offer of proof shall consist of a statement of the 
substance of the evidence which it is contended would have been adduced. 
In the case of documentary or written evidence, a copy of such evidence 
shall be marked for identification and shall constitute the offer of 
proof.
    (i) The CARP shall discourage the presentation of cumulative 
evidence, and may limit the number of witnesses that may be heard on 
behalf of any one party on any one issue.
    (j) Parties are entitled to conduct cross-examination and redirect 
examination. Cross-examination is limited to matters raised on direct 
examination. Redirect examination is limited to matters raised on cross-
examination. The panel, however, may limit cross-examination and 
redirect examination if in its judgment this evidence or examination 
would be cumulative or cause undue delay. Conversely, this

[[Page 565]]

subsection does not restrict the discretion of the panel to expand the 
scope of cross-examination or redirect examination.
    (k) Documents that have not been exchanged in advance may be shown 
to a witness on cross-examination. However, copies of such documents 
must be distributed to the CARP and to other participants or their 
counsel at hearing before being shown to the witness at the time of 
cross-examination, unless the panel directs otherwise. If the document 
is not, or will not be, supported by a witness for the cross-examining 
party, that document can be used solely to impeach the witness's direct 
testimony and cannot itself be relied upon in findings of fact as 
rebutting the witness's direct testimony. However, upon leave from the 
panel, the document may be admitted as evidence without a sponsoring 
witness if official notice is proper, or if, in the panel's view, the 
cross-examined witness is the proper sponsoring witness.
    (l) A CARP will encourage individuals or groups with the same or 
similar interests in a proceeding to select a single representative to 
conduct their examination and cross-examination of any given witness. 
However, if there is no agreement on the selection of a representative, 
each individual or group will be allowed to conduct its own examination 
and cross-examination of any given witness, but only on issues affecting 
its particular interests, provided that the questioning is not 
repetitious or cumulative of the questioning of other parties within the 
group.

FR 30635, June 5, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 251.48  Rules of evidence.

    (a) Admissibility. In any public hearing before a Copyright 
Arbitration Royalty Panel, evidence that is not unduly repetitious or 
cumulative and is relevant and material shall be admissible. The 
testimony of any witness will not be considered evidence in a proceeding 
unless the witness has been sworn.
    (b) Documentary evidence. Evidence that is submitted in the form of 
documents or detailed data and information shall be presented as 
exhibits. Relevant and material matter embraced in a document containing 
other matter not material or relevant or not intended as evidence must 
be plainly designated as the matter offered in evidence, and the 
immaterial or irrelevant parts shall be marked clearly so as to show 
they are not intended as evidence. In cases where a document in which 
material and relevant matter occurs is of such bulk that it would 
unnecessarily encumber the record, it may be marked for identification 
and the relevant and material parts, once properly authenticated, may be 
read into the record. If the CARP desires, a true copy of the material 
and relevant matter may be presented in extract form, and submitted as 
evidence. Anyone presenting documents as evidence must present copies to 
all other participants at the hearing or their attorneys, and afford 
them an opportunity to examine the documents in their entirety and offer 
into evidence any other portion that may be considered material and 
relevant.
    (c) Documents filed with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or 
Copyright Office. If the matter offered in evidence is contained in 
documents already on file with a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel or 
the Copyright Office, the documents themselves need not be produced, but 
may instead be referred to according to how they have been filed.
    (d) Public documents. If a public document such as an official 
report, decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic data, is 
offered in evidence either in whole or in part, and if the document has 
been issued by an Executive Department, a legislative agency or 
committee, or a Federal administrative agency (Government-owned 
corporations included), and is proved by the party offering it to be 
reasonably available to the public, the document need not be produced 
physically, but may be offered instead by identifying the document and 
signaling the relevant parts.
    (e) Introduction of studies and analyses. If studies or analyses are 
offered in evidence, they shall state clearly the study plan, all 
relevant assumptions, the techniques of data collection, and

[[Page 566]]

the techniques of estimation and testing. The facts and judgments upon 
which conclusions are based shall be stated clearly, together with any 
alternative courses of action considered. If requested, tabulations of 
input data shall be made available to the Copyright Arbitration Royalty 
Panel.
    (f) Statistical studies. Statistical studies offered in evidence 
shall be accompanied by a summary of their assumptions, their study 
plans, and their procedures. Supplementary details shall be included in 
appendices. For each of the following types of statistical studies the 
following should be furnished:
    (1) Sample surveys. (i) A clear description of the survey design, 
the definition of the universe under consideration, the sampling frame 
and units, the validity and confidence limits on major estimates; and
    (ii) An explanation of the method of selecting the sample and of the 
characteristics which were measured and counted.
    (2) Econometric investigations. (i) A complete description of the 
econometric model, the reasons for each assumption, and the reasons for 
the statistical specification;
    (ii) A clear statement of how any changes in the assumptions might 
affect the final result; and
    (iii) Any available alternative studies that employ alternative 
models and variables, if requested.
    (3) Experimental analysis. (i) A complete description of the design, 
the controlled conditions, and the implementation of controls; and
    (ii) A complete description of the methods of observation and 
adjustment of observation.
    (4) Studies involving statistical methodology. (i) The formula used 
for statistical estimates;
    (ii) The standard error for each component;
    (iii) The test statistics, the description of how the tests were 
conducted, related computations, computer programs, and all final 
results; and
    (iv) Summarized descriptions of input data and, if requested, the 
input data themselves.

Sec. 251.49  Transcript and record.

    (a) An official reporter for the recording and transcribing of 
hearings shall be designated by the Librarian of Congress. Anyone 
wishing to inspect or copy the transcript of a hearing may do so at a 
location specified by the chairperson of the Copyright Arbitration 
Royalty Panel conducting the hearing.
    (b) The transcript of testimony and all exhibits, papers, and

contained in the proceeding before it; Provided, that no such rules or 
orders shall amend, supplement or supersede the rules and regulations 
contained in this subchapter. See Sec. 251.7.

Sec. 251.51  Closing the record.

    To close the record of hearing, the chairperson of a Copyright 
Arbitration Royalty Panel shall make an announcement that the taking of 
testimony has concluded. In its discretion the panel may close the 
record as of a future specified date, and allow time for exhibits yet to 
be prepared to be admitted, provided that the parties to the proceeding 
stipulate on the record that they waive the opportunity to cross-examine 
or present evidence with respect to such exhibits. The record in any 
hearing that has been recessed may not be closed by the chairperson 
before the day on which the hearing is to resume,

[[Page 567]]

except upon ten days' notice to all parties.

chairperson to do so. Such filings, and any replies to them, shall take 
place at such time after the record has been closed as the chairperson 
directs.
    (b) Failure to file when directed to do so shall be considered a 
waiver of the right to participate further in the proceeding, unless 
good cause for the failure is shown.
    (c) Proposed findings of fact shall be numbered by paragraph and 
include all basic evidentiary facts developed on the record used to 
support proposed conclusions, and shall contain appropriate citations to 
the record for each evidentiary fact. Proposed findings submitted by 
someone other than a party in a proceeding shall be restricted to those 
issues specifically affecting that person.
    (d) Proposed conclusions shall be stated separately.

Sec. 251.54  Assessment of costs of arbitration panels.

    (a) The ordinary and necessary costs of an arbitrator shall be 
assessed, in accordance with Sec. 251.38, as follows:
    (1) In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, the parties to the 
proceeding shall bear the entire cost thereof in such manner and 
proportion as the panel shall direct.
    (2) In the case of a distribution proceeding, the parties to the 
proceeding shall bear the total cost of the proceeding in direct 
proportion to their share of the distribution. These costs shall be 
considered reasonable costs incurred by the Librarian of Congress and 
the Copyright Office. Such costs shall be deducted from the royalty fees 
which have been deposited and collected under title 17 of the United 
States Code and which are the subject of the distribution proceeding.
    (b) Each arbitrator shall itemize his or her expenses on the 
statement of cost in a format approved by the General Counsel and shall 
specify the name and address to whom payment should be made. In the case 
of a rate adjustment proceeding, each statement of cost shall specify 
each party's share of the total cost and the amount owed by that party 
to each arbitrator, or alternatively, reflect the method of payment 
agreed upon by the parties and the arbitrators.
    (c) The statements of cost shall be sent to the Library of Congress 
no more frequently than once a month.
    (1) In the case of a distribution proceeding, the statements of cost 
shall be sent to the Accounting Operations Section, Financial Services

cost shall be submitted to the Copyright Office as directed in paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section.
    (2) In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, the statements of 
cost shall be sent to the CARP Specialist, P.O. Box 70977, Southwest 
Station, Washington, DC 20024, or hand delivered to the Office of the 
Copyright General Counsel, Room 403, James Madison Building, 101 
Independence Avenue, SE, Washington, DC 20540.
    (d) In the case of a rate adjustment proceeding, all parties to the 
proceeding shall have 30 days from receipt of a proper statement of cost 
in which to tender payment to the arbitrators, unless otherwise directed 
by the panel. Payment should be in the form of a money order, check, 
bank draft, or electronic fund transfer.
    (e) In the case of a distribution proceeding, the Library of 
Congress shall reimburse the arbitrators from the royalty fees collected 
under title 17 of the United States Code which are the subject of the

The Librarian shall adopt the determination of the panel unless he or 
she finds that the determination is arbitrary or contrary to the 
applicable provisions of 17 U.S.C.
    (b) If the Librarian substitutes his or her own determination, the 
Librarian shall have an additional 30 days to issue the order which 
shall set forth the reasons for not accepting the panel's determination, 
and shall set forth the facts which the Librarian found relevant to his

    (c) The Librarian shall cause a copy of the order to be delivered to 
all parties participating in the proceeding. The Librarian shall also 
publish the order, and the determination of the panel, in the Federal

notice of the appeal has been served on all parties to the proceeding.


<R05>
Sec. 251.58  Judicial review.

    (a) Any order of determination issued by the Librarian of Congress

bound by the determination, to the United States Court of Appeals for 
the District of Columbia Circuit, within 30 days after publication of 
the order in the Federal Register.
    (b) If no appeal is brought within the 30-day period, the order of 
determination of the Librarian is final, and shall take effect as set

furnish to ASCAP and BMI a complete list of all public broadcasting 
entities within the scope of this section, as of January 1 of that 
calendar year. Such lists shall include:
    (1) A list of all public broadcasting entities operating as 
television broadcast stations that are associated with PBS (``PBS 
Stations''), and the PBS licensee with which each PBS Station is 
associated (``PBS Licensees''), identifying which PBS Licensees are 
Single Feed Licensees and which are Multiple Feed Licensees, and which 
PBS Stations or groups of stations are Independently Programmed 
Stations, as those terms are defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section;
    (2) A list of all public broadcasting entities operating as 
television broadcast stations that are not associated with PBS (``Non-
PBS Stations'');
    (3) A list of all public broadcasting entities operating as radio 
broadcast stations that are associated with NPR (``NPR Stations''), 
which list shall designate which NPR Stations have six (6) or more full-
time employees and which NPR Stations repeat one hundred (100) percent 
of the programming of another NPR Station; and
    (4) A list of all public broadcasting entities operating as radio 
broadcast stations that are not associated with NPR (``Non-NPR 
Stations''), which list shall designate which Non-NPR Stations have six 
(6) or more full-time employees.
    (5) For purposes of this section, Non-PBS Stations and Non-NPR

entities operating as television and radio broadcast stations which 
receive or are eligible to receive general operational support from CPB 
pursuant to the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, as amended.
    (e) Records of use. (1) PBS and NPR shall maintain and, within 
thirty-one (31) days after the end of each calendar quarter, furnish to 
ASCAP and BMI copies of their standard cue sheets listing the 
nondramatic performances of musical compositions on PBS and NPR programs 
during the preceding quarter (including to the extent such information 
is reasonably obtainable by PBS and NPR the title, author, publisher, 
type of use, and manner of performance thereof). PBS and NPR will make a 
good faith effort to obtain the information to be listed on such cue 
sheets. In addition, to the extent the information is reasonably 
obtainable, PBS shall furnish to ASCAP and BMI the PBS programming feed 
schedules including, but not limited to, the PBS National Programming 
Service schedule. PBS and NPR shall make a good faith expeditious effort 
to provide the data discussed in this paragraph in electronic format

    (2) PBS Licensees shall furnish to ASCAP and BMI, upon request and 
designation of ASCAP and BMI, music use reports listing all musical 
compositions broadcast by a particular PBS Station owned by such PBS 
Licensee showing the title, author, and publisher of each composition, 
to the extent such information is reasonably obtainable; provided, 
however, that PBS Licensees shall not be responsible for providing cue 
sheets for programs for which cue sheets have already been provided by 
PBS to ASCAP and BMI. PBS Licensees will make a good faith effort to 
obtain the information to be listed on such music use reports. In the 
case where a PBS Licensee operates only one (1) or more PBS Stations 
each of which broadcasts simultaneously or on a delayed basis all or at 
least eighty-five (85) percent of the same programming (a ``Single Feed 
Licensee''), that Single Feed Licensee will not be obligated to furnish 
music use reports to either ASCAP or to BMI for more than one of its PBS 
Stations in each calendar year. In the case where a PBS Licensee 
operates two (2) or more PBS Stations which do not broadcast all or at 
least eighty-five (85) percent of the same programming on a

[[Page 575]]

simultaneous or delayed basis (a ``Multiple Feed Licensee''), that 
Multiple Feed Licensee may be required to furnish a music use report for 
each PBS Station or group of stations which broadcasts less than eighty-
five (85) percent of the same programming as that aired by any other PBS 
Station or group of stations operated by that Multiple Feed Licensee 
(such station or group of stations being referred to as an 
``Independently Programmed Station'') in each calendar year. In each 
calendar year, ASCAP and BMI shall each be limited to requesting music 
use reports from PBS Licensees covering a total number of PBS Stations 
equal to no more than fifty (50) percent of the total of the number of 
PBS Single Feed Licensees plus the number of Independently Programmed 
Stations operated by Multiple Feed Licensees; provided, however, that 
ASCAP and BMI shall be entitled to receive music use reports covering 
not less than ninety (90) PBS Stations in any given calendar year. 
Subject to the limitations set forth above, PBS Stations shall be 
obligated to furnish to ASCAP and BMI such music use reports for each 
station for a period of no more than seven days in each calendar year.
    (3) Non-PBS Stations shall furnish to ASCAP and BMI, upon request 
and designation of ASCAP and BMI, music use reports listing all musical 
compositions broadcast by such Non-PBS Stations showing the title, 
author and publisher of each composition, to the extent such information 
is reasonably obtainable. Non-PBS Stations will make a good faith effort 
to obtain the information to be listed on such music use reports. In 
each calendar year, ASCAP and BMI shall each be limited to requesting 
music use reports from no more than fifty (50) percent of Non-PBS

Sec. 255.4  Definition of digital phonorecord delivery.

    A ``digital phonorecord delivery'' is each individual delivery of a 
phonorecord by digital transmission of a sound recording which results 
in a specifically identifiable reproduction by or for any transmission 
recipient of a phonorecord of that sound recording, regardless of 
whether the digital transmission is also a public performance of the 
sound recording or any nondramatic musical work embodied therein. A 
digital phonorecord delivery does not result from a real-time, non-
interactive subscription transmission of a sound recording where no 
reproduction of the sound recording or the musical work embodied therein 
is made from the inception of the transmission through to its receipt by 
the transmission recipient in order to make the sound recording audible.

embodied in the phonorecord shall be either 6.95 cents, or 1.3 cents per 
minute of playing time or fraction thereof, whichever amount is larger.
    (b) For every digital phonorecord delivery made on or after January 
1, 1998, except for digital phonorecord deliveries where the 
reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the 
transmission which constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery, as 
specified in 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(3)(C) and (D), the royalty rate payable 
with respect to each work embodied in the phonorecord shall be the 
royalty rate prescribed in Sec. 255.3 for the making and distribution of 
a phonorecord made and distributed on the date of the digital 
phonorecord delivery (the ``Physical Rate''). In any future proceeding 
under 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(3)(C) or (D), the royalty rates payable for a 
compulsory license for digital phonorecord deliveries in general shall 
be established de novo, and no precedential effect shall be given to the 
royalty rate payable under this paragraph for any period prior to the 
period as to which the royalty rates are to be established in such 
future proceeding.

Sec. 255.6  Royalty rate for incidental digital phonorecord deliveries.

    The royalty rate for digital phonorecord deliveries where the 
reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the 
transmission which constitutes a digital phonorecord delivery, as 
specified in 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(3)(C) and (D), is deferred for 
consideration until the next digital phonorecord delivery rate 
adjustment proceeding pursuant to the schedule set forth in Sec. 255.7; 
provided, however, that any owner or user of a copyrighted work with a 
significant interest in such royalty rate, as provided in 17 U.S.C. 
803(a)(1), may petition the Librarian of Congress to establish a rate 
prior to the commencement of the next digital phonorecord delivery rate 
adjustment proceeding. In the event such a petition is filed, the 
Librarian of Congress shall proceed in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 
115(c)(3)(D), and all applicable regulations, as though the petition had 
been filed in accordance with 17 U.S.C. 803(a)(1).

and terms for the making of digital phonorecord deliveries during the 
periods beginning January 1, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2008. The procedures 
specified in 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(3)(D) shall be repeated, in the absence of 
license agreements negotiated under 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(3)(B) and (C),

the royalty rate shall be, in lieu of the royalty rates specified in 
paragraphs (a) (2) through (4) and (d) of this section, 3.75 per centum 
of the gross receipts of the cable systems for each distant signal 
equivalent; any fraction of a distant signal equivalent shall be 
computed at its fractional value.
    (d) Commencing with the first semiannual accounting period of 1990

part, over the cable system, and that is not significantly viewed or 
otherwise exempt from the FCC's syndicated exclusivity rules in effect

Sec. 401.1  Scope.

    (a) Traditionally there have been no conditions imposed by the 
government on research performers while using private facilities which 
would preclude them from accepting research funding from other sources 
to expand, to aid in completing or to conduct separate investigations 
closely related to research activities sponsored by the government. 
Notwithstanding the right of research organizations to accept 
supplemental funding from other sources for the purpose of expediting or 
more comprehensively accomplishing the research objectives of the 
government sponsored project, it is clear that the ownership provisions 
of these regulations would remain applicable in any invention 
``conceived or first actually reduced to practice in performance'' of 
the project. Separate accounting for the two funds used to support the 
project in this case is not a determining factor.
    (1) To the extent that a non-government sponsor established a 
project which, although closely related, falls outside the planned and 
committed activities of a government-funded project and does not 
diminish or distract from the performance of such activities, inventions 
made in performance of the non-government sponsored project would not be 
subject to the conditions of these regulations. An example of such 
related but separate projects would be a government sponsored project 
having research objectives to expand scientific understanding in a field 
and a closely related industry sponsored project having as its 
objectives the application of such new knowledge to develop usable new 
technology. The time relationship in conducting the two projects and the 
use of new fundamental knowledge from one in the performance of the 
other are not important determinants since most inventions rest on a 
knowledge base built up by numerous independent research efforts 
extending over many years. Should such an invention be claimed by the 
performing organization to be the product of non-government sponsored 
research and be challenged by the sponsoring agency as being reportable 
to the government as a ``subject invention'', the challenge is 
appealable as described in Sec. 401.11(d).
    (2) An invention which is made outside of the research activities of 
a government-funded project is not viewed as a ``subject invention'' 
since it cannot be shown to have been ``conceived or first actually 
reduced to practice'' in performance of the project. An obvious example 
of this is a situation where an instrument purchased with government 
funds is later used, without interference with or cost to the 
government-funded project, in making an invention all expenses of which 
involve only non-government funds.
    (b) This part inplements 35 U.S.C. 202 through 204 and is applicable 
to all Federal agencies. It applies to all funding agreements with small 
business firms and nonprofit organizations executed after the effective 
date of this part, except for a funding agreement

[[Page 610]]

made primarily for educational purposes. Certain sections also provide 
guidance for the administration of funding agreements which predate the 
effective date of this part. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 212, no 
scholarship, fellowship, training grant, or other funding agreement made 
by a Federal agency primarily to an awardee for educational purposes 
will contain any provision giving the Federal agency any rights to 
inventions made by the awardee.
    (c) The march-in and appeals procedures in Secs. 401.6 and 401.11 
shall apply to any march-in or appeal proceeding under a funding 
agreement subject to Chapter 18 of Title 35, U.S.C., initiated after the 
effective date of this part even if the funding agreement was executed 
prior to that date.
    (d) At the request of the contractor, a funding agreement for the 
operation of a government-owned facility which is in effect on the 
effective date of this part shall be promptly amended to include the 
provisions required by Secs. 401.3(a) unless the agency determines that 
one of the exceptions at 35 U.S.C. 202(a)(i) through (iv) 
Sec. 401.3(a)(8) through (iv) of this part) is applicable and will be 
applied. If the exception at Sec. 401.3(a)(iv) is determined to be 
applicable, the funding agreement will be promptly amended to include 
the provisions required by Sec. 401.3(c).
    (e) This regulation supersedes OMB Circular A-124 and shall take 
precedence over any regulations dealing with ownership of inventions 
made by small businesses and nonprofit organizations which are 
inconsistent with it. This regulation will be followed by all agencies 
pending amendment of agency regulations to conform to this part and 
amended Chapter 18 of Title 35. Only deviations requested by a 
contractor and not inconsistent with Chapter 18 of Title 35, United 
States Code, may be made without approval of the Secretary. 
Modifications or tailoring of clauses as authorized by Sec. 401.5 or 
Sec. 401.3, when alternative provisions are used under Sec. 401.3(a)(1) 
through (4), are not considered deviations requiring the Secretary's 
approval. Three copies of proposed and final agency regulations 
supplementing this part shall be submitted to the Secretary at the 
office set out in Sec. 401.16 for approval for consistency with this 
part before they are submitted to the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) for review under Executive Order 12291 or, if no submission is 
required to be made to OMB, before their submission to the Federal 
Register for publication.
    (f) In the event an agency has outstanding prime funding agreements 
that do not contain patent flow-down provisions consistent with this 
part or earlier Office of Federal Procurement Policy regulations (OMB 
Circular A-124 or OMB Bulletin 81-22), the agency shall take appropriate 
action to ensure that small business firms or nonprofit organizations 
that are subcontractors under any such agreements and that received 
their subcontracts after July 1, 1981, receive rights in their subject 
inventions that are consistent with Chapter 18 and this part.
    (g) This part is not intended to apply to arrangements under which 
nonprofit organizations, small business firms, or others are allowed to 
use government-owned research facilities and normal technical assistance 
provided to users of those facilities, whether on a reimbursable or 
nonreimbursable basis. This part is also not intended to apply to 
arrangements under which sponsors reimburse the government or facility 
contractor for the contractor employee's time in performing work for the 
sponsor. Such arrangements are not considered ``funding agreements'' as 
defined at 35 U.S.C. 201(b) and Sec. 401.2(a) of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 401.3  Use of the standard clauses at Sec. 401.14.

    (a) Each funding agreement awarded to a small business firm or 
nonprofit organization (except those subject to 35 U.S.C. 212) shall 
contain the clause found in Sec. 401.14(a) with such modifications and 
tailoring as authorized or required elsewhere in this part. However, a 
funding agreement may contain alternative provisions--
    (1) When the contractor is not located in the United States or does 
not have a place of business located in the United States or is subject 
to the control of a foreign government; or
    (2) In exceptional circumstances when it is determined by the agency 
that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any 
subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of 
Chapter 18 of Title 35 of the United States Code; or
    (3) When it is determined by a government authority which is 
authorized

[[Page 612]]

by statute or executive order to conduct foreign intelligence or 
counterintelligence activities that the restriction or elimination of 
the right to retain title to any subject invention is necessary to 
protect the security to such activities; or
    (4) When the funding agreement includes the operation of the 
government-owned, contractor-operated facility of the Department of 
Energy primarily dedicated to that Department's naval nuclear propulsion 
or weapons related programs and all funding agreement limitations under 
this subparagraph on the contractor's right to elect title to a subject 
invention are limited to inventions occurring under the above two 
programs.
    (b) When an agency exercises the exceptions at Sec. 401.3(a)(2) or 
(3), it shall use the standard clause at Sec. 401.14(a) with only such 
modifications as are necessary to address the exceptional circumstances 
or concerns which led to the use of the exception. For example, if the 
justification relates to a particular field of use or market, the clause 
might be modified along lines similar to those described in 
Sec. 401.14(b). In any event, the clause should provide the contractor 
with an opportunity to receive greater rights in accordance with the 
procedures at Sec. 401.15. When an agency justifies and exercises the 
exception at Sec. 401.3(a)(2) and uses an alternative provision in the 
funding agreement on the basis of national security, the provision shall 
provide the contractor with the right to elect ownership to any 
invention made under such funding agreement as provided by the Standard 
Patent Rights Clause found at Sec. 401.14(a) if the invention is not 
classified by the agency within six months of the date it is reported to 
the agency, or within the same time period the Department of Energy does 
not, as authorized by regulation, law or Executive order or implementing 
regulations thereto, prohibit unauthorized dissemination of the 
invention. Contracts in support of DOE's naval nuclear propulsion 
program are exempted from this paragraph.
    (c) When the Department of Energy exercises the exception at 
Sec. 401.3(a)(4), it shall use the clause prescribed at Sec. 401.14(b) 
or substitute thereto with such modification and tailoring as authorized 
or required elsewhere in this part.
    (d) When a funding agreement involves a series of separate task 
orders, an agency may apply the exceptions at Sec. 401.3(a)(2) or (3) to 
individual task orders, and it may structure the contract so that 
modified patent rights provisions will apply to the task order even 
though the clauses at either Sec. 401.14(a) or (b) are applicable to the 
remainder of the work. Agencies are authorized to negotiate such 
modified provisions with respect to task orders added to a funding 
agreement after its initial award.
    (e) Before utilizing any of the exceptions in Sec. 401.3(a) of this 
section, the agency shall prepare a written determination, including a 
statement of facts supporting the determination, that the conditions 
identified in the exception exist. A separate statement of facts shall 
be prepared for each exceptional circumstances determination, except 
that in appropriate cases a single determination may apply to both a 
funding agreement and any subcontracts issued under it or to any funding 
agreement to which such an exception is applicable. In cases when 
Sec. 401.3(a)(2) is used, the determination shall also include an 
analysis justifying the determination. This analysis should address with 
specificity how the alternate provisions will better achieve the 
objectives set forth in 35 U.S.C. 200. A copy of each determination, 
statement of facts, and, if applicable, analysis shall be promptly 
provided to the contractor or prospective contractor along with a 
notification to the contractor or prospective contractor of its rights 
to appeal the determination of the exception under 35 U.S.C. 202(b)(4) 
and Sec. 401.4 of this part.
    (f) Except for determinations under Sec. 401.3(a)(3), the agency 
shall also provide copies of each determination, statement of fact, and 
analysis to the Secretary. These shall be sent within 30 days after the 
award of the funding agreement to which they pertain. Copies shall also 
be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration if the funding agreement is with a small business firm. 
If the Secretary of Commerce believes

[[Page 613]]

that any individual determination or pattern of determinations is 
contrary to the policies and objectives of this chapter or otherwise not 
in conformance with this chapter, the Secretary shall so advise the head 
of the agency concerned and the Administrator of the Office of Federal 
Procurement Policy and recommend corrective actions.
    (g) To assist the Comptroller General of the United States to 
accomplish his or her responsibilities under 35 U.S.C. 202, each Federal 
agency that enters into any funding agreements with nonprofit 
organizations or small business firms shall accumulate and, at the 
request of the Comptroller General, provide the Comptroller General or 
his or her duly authorized representative the total number of prime 
agreements entered into with small business firms or nonprofit 
organizations that contain the patent rights clause in this part or 
under OMB Circular A-124 for each fiscal year beginning with October 1, 
1982.
    (h) To qualify for the standard clause, a prospective contractor may 
be required by an agency to certify that it is either a small business 
firm or a nonprofit organization. If the agency has reason to question 
the status of the prospective contractor as a small business firm, it 
may file a protest in accordance with 13 CFR 121.9. If it questions 
nonprofit status, it may require the prospective contractor to furnish 
evidence to establish its status as a nonprofit organization.


<R05>
Sec. 401.4  Contractor appeals of exceptions.

    (a) In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(b)(4) a contractor has the 
right to an administrative review of a determination to use one of the 
exceptions at Sec. 401.3(a) (1) through (4) if the contractor believes 
that a determination is either contrary to the policies and objectives 
of this chapter or constitutes an abuse of discretion by the agency. 
Paragraph (b) of this section specifies the procedures to be followed by 
contractors and agencies in such cases. The assertion of such a claim by 
the contractor shall not be used as a basis for withholding or delaying 
the award of a funding agreement or for suspending performance under an 
award. Pending final resolution of the claim the contract may be issued 
with the patent rights provision proposed by the agency; however, should 
the final decision be in favor of the contractor, the funding agreement 
will be amended accordingly and the amendment made retroactive to the 
effective date of the funding agreement.
    (b)(1) A contractor may appeal a determination by providing written 
notice to the agency within 30 working days from the time it receives a 
copy of the agency's determination, or within such longer time as an 
agency may specify in its regulations. The contractor's notice should 
specifically identify the basis for the appeal.
    (2) The appeal shall be decided by the head of the agency or by his/
her designee who is at a level above the person who made the 
determination. If the notice raises a genuine dispute over the material 
facts, the head of the agency or the designee shall undertake, or refer 
the matter for, fact-finding.
    (3) Fact-finding shall be conducted in accordance with procedures 
established by the agency. Such procedures shall be as informal as 
practicable and be consistent with principles of fundamental fairness. 
The procedures should afford the contractor the opportunity to appear 
with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and 
confront such persons as the agency may rely upon. A transcribed record 
shall be made and shall be available at cost to the contractor upon 
request. The requirement for a transcribed record may be waived by 
mutual agreement of the contractor and the agency.
    (4) The official conducting the fact-finding shall prepare or adopt 
written findings of fact and transmit them to the head of the agency or 
designee promptly after the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding 
along with a recommended decision. A copy of the findings of fact and 
recommended decision shall be sent to the contractor by registered or 
certified mail.
    (5) Fact-finding should be completed within 45 working days from the 
date the agency receives the contractor's written notice.
    (6) When fact-finding has been conducted, the head of the agency or 
designee shall base his or her decision on

[[Page 614]]

the facts found, together with any argument submitted by the contractor, 
agency officials or any other information in the administrative record. 
In cases referred for fact-finding, the agency head or the designee may 
reject only those facts that have been found to be clearly erroneous, 
but must explicitly state the rejection and indicate the basis for the 
contrary finding. The agency head or the designee may hear oral 
arguments after fact-finding provided that the contractor or 
contractor's attorney or representative is present and given an 
opportunity to make arguments and rebuttal. The decision of the agency 
head or the designee shall be in writing and, if it is unfavorable to 
the contractor shall include an explanation of the basis of the 
decision. The decision of the agency or designee shall be made within 30 
working days after fact-finding or, if there was no fact-finding, within 
45 working days from the date the agency received the contractor's 
written notice. A contractor adversely affected by a determination under 
this section may, at any time within sixty days after the determination 
is issued, file a petition in the United States Claims Court, which 
shall have jurisdiction to determine the appeal on the record and to 
affirm, reverse, remand, or modify as appropriate, the determination of 
the Federal agency.


<R05>
Sec. 401.5  Modification and tailoring of clauses.

    (a) Agencies should complete the blank in paragraph (g)(2) of the 
clauses at Sec. 401.14 in accordance with their own or applicable 
government-wide regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
In grants and cooperative agreements (and in contracts, if not 
inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation) agencies wishing 
to apply the same clause to all subcontractors as is applied to the 
contractor may delete paragraph (g)(2) of the clause and delete the 
words ``to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit 
organization'' from paragraph (g)(1). Also, if the funding agreement is 
a grant or cooperative agreement, paragraph (g)(3) may be deleted. When 
either paragraph (g)(2) or paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) are deleted, the 
remaining paragraph or paragraphs should be renumbered appropriately.
    (b) Agencies should complete paragraph (l), ``Communications'', at 
the end of the clauses at Sec. 401.14 by designating a central point of 
contact for communications on matters relating to the clause. Additional 
instructions on communications may also be included in paragraph (l).
    (c) Agencies may replace the italicized words and phrases in the 
clauses at Sec. 401.14 with those appropriate to the particular funding 
agreement. For example, ``contracts'' could be replaced by ``grant,'' 
``contractor'' by ``grantee,'' and ``contracting officer'' by ``grants 
officer.'' Depending on its use, ``Federal agency'' can be replaced 
either by the identification of the agency or by the specification of 
the particular office or official within the agency.
    (d) When the agency head or duly authorized designee determines at 
the time of contracting with a small business firm or nonprofit 
organization that it would be in the national interest to acquire the 
right to sublicense foreign governments or international organizations 
pursuant to any existing treaty or international agreement, a sentence 
may be added at the end of paragraph (b) of the clause at Sec. 401.14 as 
follows:

    This license will include the right of the government to sublicense 
foreign governments, their nationals, and international organizations, 
pursuant to the following treaties or international agreements:

----------------.


The blank above should be completed with the names of applicable 
existing treaties or international agreements, agreements of 
cooperation, memoranda of understanding, or similar arrangements, 
including military agreements relating to weapons development and 
production. The above language is not intended to apply to treaties or 
other agreements that are in effect on the date of the award but which 
are not listed. Alternatively, agencies may use substantially similar 
language relating the government's rights to specific treaties or other 
agreements identified elsewhere in the funding agreement. The language 
may also be modified to

[[Page 615]]

make clear that the rights granted to the foreign government, and its 
nationals or an international organization may be for additional rights 
beyond a license or sublicense if so required by the applicable treaty 
or international agreement. For example, in some exclusive licenses or 
even the assignment of title in the foreign country involved might be 
required. Agencies may also modify the language above to provide for the 
direct licensing by the contractor of the foreign government or 
international organization.
    (e) If the funding agreement involves performance over an extended 
period of time, such as the typical funding agreement for the operation 
of a government-owned facility, the following language may also be 
added:

    The agency reserves the right to unilaterally amend this funding 
agreement to identify specific treaties or international agreements 
entered into or to be entered into by the government after the effective 
date of this funding agreement and effectuate those license or other 
rights which are necessary for the government to meet its obligations to 
foreign governments, their nationals and international organizations 
under such treaties or international agreements with respect to subject 
inventions made after the date of the amendment.

    (f) Agencies may add additional subparagraphs to paragraph (f) of 
the clauses at Sec. 401.14 to require the contractor to do one or more 
of the following:
    (1) Provide a report prior to the close-out of a funding agreement 
listing all subject inventions or stating that there were none.
    (2) Provide, upon request, the filing date, patent application 
number and title; a copy of the patent application; and patent number 
and issue date for any subject invention in any country in which the 
contractor has applied for a patent.
    (3) Provide periodic (but no more frequently than annual) listings 
of all subject inventions which were disclosed to the agency during the 
period covered by the report.
    (g) If the contract is with a nonprofit organization and is for the 
operation of a government-owned, contractor-operated facility, the 
following will be substituted for paragraph (k)(3) of the clause at 
Sec. 401.14(a):

    (3) After payment of patenting costs, licensing costs, payments to 
inventors, and other expenses incidental to the administration of 
subject inventions, the balance of any royalties or income earned and 
retained by the contractor during any fiscal year on subject inventions 
under this or any successor contract containing the same requirement, up 
to any amount equal to five percent of the budget of the facility for 
that fiscal year, shall be used by the contractor for scientific 
research, development, and education consistent with the research and 
development mission and objectives of the facility, including activities 
that increase the licensing potential of other inventions of the 
facility. If the balance exceeds five percent, 75 percent of the excess 
above five percent shall be paid by the contractor to the Treasury of 
the United States and the remaining 25 percent shall be used by the 
contractor only for the same purposes as described above. To the extent 
it provides the most effective technology transfer, the licensing of 
subject inventions shall be administered by contractor employees on 
location at the facility.

    (h) If the contract is for the operation of a government-owned 
facility, agencies may add the following at the end of paragraph (f) of 
the clause at Sec. 401.14(a):

    (5) The contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective 
procedures to ensure that subject inventions are promptly identified and 
timely disclosed and shall submit a description of the procedures to the 
contracting officer so that the contracting officer may evaluate and 
determine their effectiveness.

<R05>
Sec. 401.6  Exercise of march-in rights.

    (a) The following procedures shall govern the exercise of the march-
in rights of the agencies set forth in 35 U.S.C. 203 and paragraph (j) 
of the clause at Sec. 401.14.
    (b) Whenever an agency receives information that it believes might 
warrant the exercise of march-in rights, before initiating any march-in 
proceeding, it shall notify the contractor in writing of the information 
and request informal written or oral comments from the contractor as 
well as information relevant to the matter. In the absence of any 
comments from the contractor within 30 days, the agency may, at its 
discretion, proceed with the procedures below. If a comment is received 
within 30 days, or later if the

[[Page 616]]

agency has not initiated the procedures below, then the agency shall, 
within 60 days after it receives the comment, either initiate the 
procedures below or notify the contractor, in writing, that it will not 
pursue march-in rights on the basis of the available information.
    (c) A march-in proceeding shall be initiated by the issuance of a 
written notice by the agency to the contractor and its assignee or 
exclusive licensee, as applicable and if known to the agency, stating 
that the agency is considering the exercise of march-in rights. The 
notice shall state the reasons for the proposed march-in in terms 
sufficient to put the contractor on notice of the facts upon which the 
action would be based and shall specify the field or fields of use in 
which the agency is considering requiring licensing. The notice shall 
advise the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) of its rights, as 
set forth in this section and in any supplemental agency regulations. 
The determination to exercise march-in rights shall be made by the head 
of the agency or his or her designee.
    (d) Within 30 days after the receipt of the written notice of march-
in, the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) may submit in 
person, in writing, or through a representative, information or argument 
in opposition to the proposed march-in, including any additional 
specific information which raises a genuine dispute over the material 
facts upon which the march-in is based. If the information presented 
raises a genuine dispute over the material facts, the head of the agency 
or designee shall undertake or refer the matter to another official for 
fact-finding.
    (e) Fact-finding shall be conducted in accordance with the 
procedures established by the agency. Such procedures shall be as 
informal as practicable and be consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness. The procedures should afford the contractor the opportunity to 
appear with counsel, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and 
confront such persons as the agency may present. A transcribed record 
shall be made and shall be available at cost to the contractor upon 
request. The requirement for a transcribed record may be waived by 
mutual agreement of the contractor and the agency. Any portion of the 
march-in proceeding, including a fact-finding hearing that involves 
testimony or evidence relating to the utilization or efforts at 
obtaining utilization that are being made by the contractor, its 
assignee, or licensees shall be closed to the public, including 
potential licensees. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), agencies 
shall not disclose any such information obtained during a march-in 
proceeding to persons outside the government except when such release is 
authorized by the contractor (assignee or licensee).
    (f) The official conducting the fact-finding shall prepare or adopt 
written findings of fact and transmit them to the head of the agency or 
designee promptly after the conclusion of the fact-finding proceeding 
along with a recommended determination. A copy of the findings of fact 
shall be sent to the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) by 
registered or certified mail. The contractor (assignee or exclusive 
licensee) and agency representatives will be given 30 days to submit 
written arguments to the head of the agency or designee; and, upon 
request by the contractor oral arguments will be held before the agency 
head or designee that will make the final determination.
    (g) In cases in which fact-finding has been conducted, the head of 
the agency or designee shall base his or her determination on the facts 
found, together with any other information and written or oral arguments 
submitted by the contractor (assignee or exclusive licensee) and agency 
representatives, and any other information in the administrative record. 
The consistency of the exercise of march-in rights with the policy and 
objectives of 35 U.S.C. 200 shall also be considered. In cases referred 
for fact-finding, the head of the agency or designee may reject only 
those facts that have been found to be clearly erroneous, but must 
explicitly state the rejection and indicate the basis for the contrary 
finding. Written notice of the determination whether march-in rights 
will be exercised shall be made by the head of the agency or designee 
and sent to the contractor (assignee of exclusive licensee) by certified 
or registered mail within 90 days

[[Page 617]]

after the completion of fact-finding or 90 days after oral arguments, 
whichever is later, or the proceedings will be deemed to have been 
terminated and thereafter no march-in based on the facts and reasons 
upon which the proceeding was initiated may be exercised.
    (h) An agency may, at any time, terminate a march-in proceeding if 
it is satisfied that it does not wish to exercise march-in rights.
    (i) The procedures of this part shall also apply to the exercise of 
march-in rights against inventors receiving title to subject inventions 
under 35 U.S.C. 202(d) and, for that purpose, the term ``contractor'' as 
used in this section shall be deemed to include the inventor.
    (j) An agency determination unfavorable to the contractor (assignee 
or exclusive licensee) shall be held in abeyance pending the exhaustion 
of appeals or petitions filed under 35 U.S.C. 203(2).
    (k) For purposes of this section the term exclusive licensee 
includes a partially exclusive licensee.
    (l) Agencies are authorized to issue supplemental procedures not 
inconsistent with this part for the conduct of march-in proceedings.


<R05>
Sec. 401.7  Small business preference.

    (a) Paragraph (k)(4) of the clauses at Sec. 401.14 Implements the 
small business preference requirement of 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(7)(D). 
Contractors are expected to use efforts that are reasonable under the 
circumstances to attract small business licensees. They are also 
expected to give small business firms that meet the standard outlined in 
the clause a preference over other applicants for licenses. What 
constitutes reasonable efforts to attract small business licensees will 
vary with the circumstances and the nature, duration, and expense of 
efforts needed to bring the invention to the market. Paragraph (k)(4) is 
not intended, for example, to prevent nonprofit organizations from 
providing larger firms with a right of first refusal or other options in 
inventions that relate to research being supported under long-term or 
other arrangements with larger companies. Under such circumstances it 
would not be resonable to seek and to give a preference to small 
business licensees.
    (b) Small business firms that believe a nonprofit organization is 
not meeting its obligations under the clause may report their concerns 
to the Secretary. To the extent deemed appropriate, the Secretary will 
undertake informal investigation of the concern, and, if appropriate, 
enter into discussions or negotiations with the nonprofit organization 
to the end of improving its efforts in meeting its obligations under the 
clause. However, in no event will the Secretary intervene in ongoing 
negotiations or contractor decisions concerning the licensing of a 
specific subject invention. All the above investigations, discussions, 
and negotiations of the Secretary will be in coordination with other 
interested agencies, including the Small Business Administration; and in 
the case of a contract for the operation of a government-owned, 
contractor operated research or production facility, the Secretary will 
coordinate with the agency responsible for the facility prior to any 
discussions or negotiations with the contractor.


<R05>
401.8  Reporting on utilization of subject inventions.

    (a) Paragraph (h) of the clauses at Sec. 401.14 and its counterpart 
in the clause at Attachment A to OMB Circular A-124 provides that 
agencies have the right to receive periodic reports from the contractor 
on utilization of inventions. Agencies exercising this right should 
accept such information, to the extent feasible, in the format that the 
contractor normally prepares it for its own internal purposes. The 
prescription of forms should be avoided. However, any forms or standard 
questionnaires that are adopted by an agency for this purpose must 
comply with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Copies 
shall be sent to the Secretary.
    (b) In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5) and the terms of the 
clauses at Sec. 401.14, agencies shall not disclose such information to 
persons outside the government. Contractors will continue to provide 
confidential markings to help prevent inadvertent release outside the 
agency.

<R05>
Sec. 401.9  Retention of rights by contractor employee inventor.

    Agencies which allow an employee/inventor of the contractor to 
retain rights to a subject invention made under a funding agreement with 
a small business firm or nonprofit organization contractor, as 
authorized by 35 U.S.C. 202(d), will impose upon the inventor at least 
those conditions that would apply to a small business firm contractor 
under paragraphs (d)(1) and (3); (f)(4); (h); (i); and (j) of the clause 
at Sec. 401.14(a).


<R05>
Sec. 401.10  Government assignment to contractor of rights in invention of government employee.

    In any case when a Federal employee is a co-inventor of any 
invention made under a funding agreement with a small business firm or 
nonprofit organization and the Federal agency employing such co-inventor 
transfers or reassigns the right it has acquired in the subject 
invention from its employee to the contractor as authorized by 35 U.S.C. 
202(e), the assignment will be made subject to the same conditions as 
apply to the contractor under the patent rights clause of its funding 
agreement. Agencies may add additional conditions as long as they are 
consistent with 35 U.S.C. 201-206.


<R05>
Sec. 401.11  Appeals.

    (a) As used in this section, the term standard clause means the 
clause at Sec. 401.14 of this part and the clauses previously prescribed 
by either OMB Circular A-124 or OMB Bulletin 81-22.
    (b) The agency official initially authorized to take any of the 
following actions shall provide the contractor with a written statement 
of the basis for his or her action at the time the action is taken, 
including any relevant facts that were relied upon in taking the action.
    (1) A refusal to grant an extension under paragraph (c)(4) of the 
standard clauses.
    (2) A request for a conveyance of title under paragraph (d) of the 
standard clauses.
    (3) A refusal to grant a waiver under paragraph (i) of the standard 
clauses.
    (4) A refusal to approve an assignment under paragraph (k)(1) of the 
standard clauses.
    (5) A refusal to grant an extension of the exclusive license period 
under paragraph (k)(2) of the clauses prescribed by either OMB Circular 
A-124 or OMB Bulletin 81-22.
    (c) Each agency shall establish and publish procedures under which 
any of the agency actions listed in paragraph (b) of this section may be 
appealed to the head of the agency or designee. Review at this level 
shall consider both the factual and legal basis for the actions and its 
consistency with the policy and objectives of 35 U.S.C. 200-206.
    (d) Appeals procedures established under paragraph (c) of this 
section shall include administrative due process procedures and 
standards for fact-finding at least comparable to those set forth in 
Sec. 401.6 (e) through (g) whenever there is a dispute as to the factual 
basis for an agency request for a conveyance of title under paragraph 
(d) of the standard clause, including any dispute as to whether or not 
an invention is a subject invention.
    (e) To the extent that any of the actions described in paragraph (b) 
of this section are subject to appeal under the Contract Dispute Act, 
the procedures under the Act will satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 
(c) and (d) of this section.


<R05>
Sec. 401.12  Licensing of background patent rights to third parties.

    (a) A funding agreement with a small business firm or a domestic 
nonprofit organization will not contain a provision allowing a Federal 
agency to require the licensing to third parties of inventions owned by 
the contractor that are not subject inventions unless such provision has 
been approved by the agency head and a written justification has been 
signed by the agency head. Any such provision will clearly state whether 
the licensing may be required in connection with the practice of a 
subject invention, a specifically identified work object, or both. The 
agency head may not delegate the authority to approve such provisions or 
to sign the justification required for such provisions.

[[Page 619]]

    (b) A Federal agency will not require the licensing of third parties 
under any such provision unless the agency head determines that the use 
of the invention by others is necessary for the practice of a subject 
invention or for the use of a work object of the funding agreement and 
that such action is necessary to achieve practical application of the 
subject invention or work object. Any such determination will be on the 
record after an opportunity for an agency hearing. The contractor shall 
be given prompt notification of the determination by certified or 
registered mail. Any action commenced for judicial review of such 
determination shall be brought within sixty days after notification of 
such determination.


<R05>
Sec. 401.13  Administration of patent rights clauses.

    (a) In the event a subject invention is made under funding 
agreements of more than one agency, at the request of the contractor or 
on their own initiative the agencies shall designate one agency as 
responsible for administration of the rights of the government in the 
invention.
    (b) Agencies shall promptly grant, unless there is a significant 
reason not to, a request by a nonprofit organization under paragraph 
(k)(2) of the clauses prescribed by either OMB Circular A-124 or OMB 
Bulletin 81-22 inasmuch as 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(7) has since been amended to 
eliminate the limitation on the duration of exclusive licenses. 
Similarly, unless there is a significant reason not to, agencies shall 
promptly approve an assignment by a nonprofit organization to an 
organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of 
inventions when a request for approval has been necessitated under 
paragraph (k)(1) of the clauses prescribed by either OMB Circular A-124 
or OMB Bulletin 81-22 because the patent management organization is 
engaged in or holds a substantial interest in other organizations 
engaged in the manfacture or sale of products or the use of processes 
that might utilize the invention or be in competition with embodiments 
of the invention. As amended, 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(7) no longer contains 
this limitation. The policy of this subsection should also be followed 
in connection with similar approvals that may be required under 
Institutional Patent Agreements, other patent rights clauses, or waivers 
that predate Chapter 18 of Title 35, United States Code.
    (c) The President's Patent Policy Memorandum of February 18, 1983, 
states that agencies should protect the confidentiality of invention 
disclosure, patent applications, and utilization reports required in 
performance or in consequence of awards to the extent permitted by 35 
U.S.C. 205 or other applicable laws. The following requirements should 
be followed for funding agreements covered by and predating this part 
401.
    (1) To the extent authorized by 35 U.S.C. 205, agencies shall not 
disclose to third parties pursuant to requests under the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) any information disclosing a subject invention 
for a reasonable time in order for a patent application to be filed. 
With respect to subject inventions of contractors that are small 
business firms or nonprofit organizations, a reasonable time shall be 
the time during which an initial patent application may be filed under 
paragraph (c) of the standard clause found at Sec. 401.14(a) or such 
other clause may be used in the funding agreement. However, an agency 
may disclose such subject inventions under the FOIA, at its discretion, 
after a contractor has elected not to retain title or after the time in 
which the contractor is required to make an election if the contractor 
has not made an election within that time. Similarly, an agency may 
honor a FOIA request at its discretion if it finds that the same 
information has previously been published by the inventor, contractor, 
or otherwise. If the agency plans to file itself when the contractor has 
not elected title, it may, of course, continue to avail itself of the 
authority of 35 U.S.C. 205.
    (2) In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 205, agencies shall not disclose or 
release for a period of 18 months from the filing date of the patent 
application to third parties pursuant to requests under the Freedom of 
Information Act, or otherwise, copies of any document which the agency 
obtained under this clause which is part of an application

[[Page 620]]

for patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or any foreign 
patent office filed by the contractor (or its assignees, licensees, or 
employees) on a subject invention to which the contractor has elected to 
retain title. This prohibition does not extend to disclosure to other 
government agencies or contractors of government agencies under an 
obligation to maintain such information in confidence.
    (3) A number of agencies have policies to encourage public 
dissemination of the results of work supported by the agency through 
publication in government or other publications of technical reports of 
contractors or others. In recognition of the fact that such publication, 
if it included descriptions of a subject invention could create bars to 
obtaining patent protection, it is the policy of the executive branch 
that agencies will not include in such publication programs copies of 
disclosures of inventions submitted by small business firms or nonprofit 
organizations, pursuant to paragraph (c) of the standard clause found at 
Sec. 401.14(a), except that under the same circumstances under which 
agencies are authorized to release such information pursuant to FOIA 
requests under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, agencies may publish 
such disclosures.
    (4) Nothing in this paragraph is intended to preclude agencies from 
including in the publication activities described in the first sentence 
of paragraph (c)(3), the publication of materials describing a subject 
invention to the extent such materials were provided as part of a 
technical report or other submission of the contractor which were 
submitted independently of the requirements of the patent rights 
provisions of the contract. However, if a small business firm or 
nonprofit organization notifies the agency that a particular report or 
other submission contains a disclosure of a subject invention to which 
it has elected title or may elect title, the agency shall use reasonable 
efforts to restrict its publication of the material for six months from 
date of its receipt of the report or submission or, if earlier, until 
the contractor has filed an initial patent application. Agencies, of 
course, retain the discretion to delay publication for additional 
periods of time.
    (5) Nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit the authority of 
agencies provided in 35 U.S.C. 205 in circumstances not specifically 
described in this paragraph.

<R05>
Sec. 401.14  Standard patent rights clauses.

    (a) The following is the standard patent rights clause to be used as 
specified in Sec. 401.3(a).

    Patent Rights (Small Business Firms and Nonprofit Organizations)

                             (a) Definitions

    (1) Invention means any invention or discovery which is or may be 
patentable or otherwise protectable under Title 35 of the United States 
Code, or any novel variety of plant which is or may be protected under 
the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 et seq.).
    (2) Subject invention means any invention of the contractor 
conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of 
work under this contract, provided that in the case of a variety of 
plant, the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the 
Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during 
the period of contract performance.
    (3) Practical Application means to manufacture in the case of a 
composition or product, to practice in the case of a process or method, 
or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, 
under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being 
utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or 
government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.
    (4) Made when used in relation to any invention means the conception 
or first actual reduction to practice of such invention.
    (5) Small Business Firm means a small business concern as defined at 
section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations 
of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For the 
purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business concerns 
involved in government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.3-8 
and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.
    (6) Nonprofit Organization means a university or other institution 
of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code

[[Page 621]]

of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) 
of the Internal Revenue Code (25 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit 
scientific or educational organization qualified under a state nonprofit 
organization statute.

                   (b) Allocation of Principal Rights

    The Contractor may retain the entire right, title, and interest 
throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions 
of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention 
in which the Contractor retains title, the Federal government shall have 
a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to 
practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the 
subject invention throughout the world.

    (c) Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent 
                        Application by Contractor

    (1) The contractor will disclose each subject invention to the 
Federal Agency within two months after the inventor discloses it in 
writing to contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. The 
disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written report and 
shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the 
inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to 
convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the 
disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, 
chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The 
disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of 
the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been 
submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for 
publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to 
the agency, the Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the 
acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or 
of any on sale or public use planned by the contractor.
    (2) The Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain 
title to any such invention by notifying the Federal agency within two 
years of disclosure to the Federal agency. However, in any case where 
publication, on sale or public use has initiated the one year statutory 
period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the 
United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the 
agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the 
statutory period.
    (3) The contractor will file its initial patent application on a 
subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year 
after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any 
statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the 
United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The 
contractor will file patent applications in additional countries or 
international patent offices within either ten months of the 
corresponding initial patent application or six months from the date 
permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to 
file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited 
by a Secrecy Order.
    (4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure, election, and 
filing under subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) may, at the discretion of 
the agency, be granted.

           (d) Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title

    The contractor will convey to the Federal agency, upon written 
request, title to any subject invention--
    (1) If the contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the 
subject invention within the times specified in (c), above, or elects 
not to retain title; provided that the agency may only request title 
within 60 days after learning of the failure of the contractor to 
disclose or elect within the specified times.
    (2) In those countries in which the contractor fails to file patent 
applications within the times specified in (c) above; provided, however, 
that if the contractor has filed a patent application in a country after 
the times specified in (c) above, but prior to its receipt of the 
written request of the Federal agency, the contractor shall continue to 
retain title in that country.
    (3) In any country in which the contractor decides not to continue 
the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, 
or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a 
subject invention.

(e) Minimum Rights to Contractor and Protection of the Contractor Right 
                                 to File

    (1) The contractor will retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license 
throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government 
obtains title, except if the contractor fails to disclose the invention 
within the times specified in (c), above. The contractor's license 
extends to its domestic subsidiary and affiliates, if any, within the 
corporate structure of which the contractor is a party and includes the 
right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the 
contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was 
awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the 
Federal agency except when transferred to the sucessor of that party of 
the contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by 
the funding Federal agency to the extent necessary to

[[Page 622]]

achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention 
pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in 
accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and agency 
licensing regulations (if any). This license will not be revoked in that 
field of use or the geographical areas in which the contractor has 
achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the 
invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any 
foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of the 
funding Federal agency to the extent the contractor, its licensees, or 
the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical 
application in that foreign country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the funding 
Federal agency will furnish the contractor a written notice of its 
intention to revoke or modify the license, and the contractor will be 
allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by the 
funding Federal agency for good cause shown by the contractor) after the 
notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. 
The contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable 
regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and agency regulations (if any) 
concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision 
concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

       (f) Contractor Action to Protect the Government's Interest

    (1) The contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and 
promptly deliver to the Federal agency all instruments necessary to (i) 
establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world 
in those subject inventions to which the contractor elects to retain 
title, and (ii) convey title to the Federal agency when requested under 
paragraph (d) above and to enable the government to obtain patent 
protection throughout the world in that subject invention.
    (2) The contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its 
employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose 
promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the 
administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the 
contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the 
contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c), 
above, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications 
on subject inventions and to establish the government's rights in the 
subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, 
the information required by (c)(1), above. The contractor shall instruct 
such employees through employee agreements or other suitable educational 
programs on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to 
permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign 
statutory bars.
    (3) The contractor will notify the Federal agency of any decisions 
not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance 
fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, 
in any country, not less than thirty days before the expiration of the 
response period required by the relevant patent office.
    (4) The contractor agrees to include, within the specification of 
any United States patent applications and any patent issuing thereon 
covering a subject invention, the following statement, ``This invention 
was made with government support under (identify the contract) awarded 
by (identify the Federal agency). The government has certain rights in 
the invention.''

                            (g) Subcontracts

    (1) The contractor will include this clause, suitably modified to 
identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for 
experimental, developmental or research work to be performed by a small 
business firm or domestic nonprofit organization. The subcontractor will 
retain all rights provided for the contractor in this clause, and the 
contractor will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the 
subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
    (2) The contractor will include in all other subcontracts, 
regardless of tier, for experimental developmental or research work the 
patent rights clause required by (cite section of agency implementing 
regulations or FAR).
    (3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, when the prime award 
with the Federal agency was a contract (but not a grant or cooperative 
agreement), the agency, subcontractor, and the contractor agree that the 
mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a 
contract between the subcontractor and the Federal agency with respect 
to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in 
this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract 
Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this 
clause.

           (h) Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions

    The Contractor agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more 
frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on 
efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the 
contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include 
information regarding the status of development, date of first 
commerical sale or use, gross royalties received by the contractor, and 
such other data and information

[[Page 623]]

as the agency may reasonably specify. The contractor also agrees to 
provide additional reports as may be requested by the agency in 
connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the agency in 
accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 
202(c)(5), the agency agrees it will not disclose such information to 
persons outside the government without permission of the contractor.

                (i) Preference for United States Industry

    Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the contractor 
agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the 
exclusive right to use or sell any subject inventions in the United 
States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject 
invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be 
manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual 
cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by the 
Federal agency upon a showing by the contractor or its assignee that 
reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on 
similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture 
substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances 
domestic manufacture is not commerically feasible.

                           (j) March-in Rights

    The contractor agrees that with respect to any subject invention in 
which it has acquired title, the Federal agency has the right in 
accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental 
regulations of the agency to require the contractor, an assignee or 
exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, 
partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a 
responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable 
under the circumstances, and if the contractor, assignee, or exclusive 
licensee refuses such a request the Federal agency has the right to 
grant such a license itself if the Federal agency determines that:
    (1) Such action is necessary because the contractor or assignee has 
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
invention in such field of use.
    (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee or their 
licensees;
    (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisfied by the contractor, assignee or licensees; or
    (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by 
paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because 
a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention 
in the United States is in breach of such agreement.

    (k) Special Provisions for Contracts with Nonprofit Organizations

    If the contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that:
    (1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be 
assigned without the approval of the Federal agency, except where such 
assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary 
functions the management of inventions, provided that such assignee will 
be subject to the same provisions as the contractor;
    (2) The contractor will share royalties collected on a subject 
invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors 
(when the agency deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is 
assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
    (3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the contractor 
with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including 
payments to inventors) incidential to the administration of subject 
inventions, will be utilized for the support of scientific research or 
education; and
    (4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances 
to attract licensees of subject invention that are small business firms 
and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when 
licensing a subject invention if the contractor determines that the 
small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention 
which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to 
practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are 
not small business firms; provided, that the contractor is also 
satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources 
to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a 
preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the 
contractor. However, the contractor agrees that the Secretary may review 
the contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small 
business applicants, and the contractor will negotiate changes to its 
licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary when the 
Secretary's review discloses that the contractor could take reasonable 
steps to implement more effectively the reqirements of this paragraph 
(k)(4).

                            (l) Communication

    (Complete According to Instructions at 401.5(b))

    (b) When the Department of Energy (DOE) determines to use 
alternative provisions under Sec. 401.3(a)(4), the standard clause at 
Sec. 401.14(a), of this section,

[[Page 624]]

shall be used with the following modifications unless a substitute 
clause is drafted by DOE:
    (1) The title of the clause shall be changed to read as follows: 
Patent Rights to Nonprofit DOE Facility Operators
    (2) Add an ``(A)'' after ``(1)'' in paragraph (c)(1) and add 
subparagraphs (B) and (C) to paragraph (c)(1) as follows:

    (B) If the subject invention occurred under activities funded by the 
naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs of DOE, then the 
provisions of this subparagraph (c)(1)(B) will apply in lieu of 
paragraphs (c)(2) and (3). In such cases the contractor agrees to assign 
the government the entire right, title, and interest thereto throughout 
the world in and to the subject invention except to the extent that 
rights are retained by the contractor through a greater rights 
determination or under paragraph (e), below. The contractor, or an 
employee-inventor, with authorization of the contractor, may submit a 
request for greater rights at the time the invention is disclosed or 
within a reasonable time thereafter. DOE will process such a request in 
accordance with procedures at 37 CFR 401.15. Each determination of 
greater rights will be subject to paragraphs (h)-(k) of this clause and 
such additional conditions, if any, deemed to be appropriate by the 
Department of Energy.
    (C) At the time an invention is disclosed in accordance with 
(c)(1)(A) above, or within 90 days thereafter, the contractor will 
submit a written statement as to whether or not the invention occurred 
under a naval nuclear propulsion or weapons-related program of the 
Department of Energy. If this statement is not filed within this time, 
subparagraph (c)(1)(B) will apply in lieu of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3). 
The contractor statement will be deemed conclusive unless, within 60 
days thereafter, the Contracting Officer disagrees in writing, in which 
case the determination of the Contracting Officer will be deemed 
conclusive unless the contractor files a claim under the Contract 
Disputes Act within 60 days after the Contracting Officer's 
determination. Pending resolution of the matter, the invention will be 
subject to subparagraph (c)(1)(B).

    (3) Paragraph (k)(3) of the clause will be modified as prescribed at 
Sec. 401.5(g).


<R05>
Sec. 401.15  Deferred determinations.

    (a) This section applies to requests for greater rights in subject 
inventions made by contractors when deferred determination provisions 
were included in the funding agreement because one of the exceptions at 
Sec. 401.3(a) was applied, except that the Department of Energy is 
authorized to process deferred determinations either in accordance with 
its waiver regulations or this section. A contractor requesting greater 
rights should include with its request information on its plans and 
intentions to bring the invention to practical application. Within 90 
days after receiving a request and supporting information, or sooner if 
a statutory bar to patenting is imminent, the agency should seek to make 
a determination. In any event, if a bar to patenting is imminent, unless 
the agency plans to file on its own, it shall authorize the contractor 
to file a patent application pending a determination by the agency. Such 
a filing shall normally be at the contractor's own risk and expense. 
However, if the agency subsequently refuses to allow the contractor to 
retain title and elects to proceed with the patent application under 
government ownership, it shall reimburse the contractor for the cost of 
preparing and filing the patent application.
    (b) If the circumstances of concerns which originally led the agency 
to invoke an exception under Sec. 401.3(a) are not applicable to the 
actual subject invention or are no longer valid because of subsequent 
events, the agency should allow the contractor to retain title to the 
invention on the same conditions as would have applied if the standard 
clause at Sec. 401.14(a) had been used originally, unless it has been 
licensed.
    (c) If paragraph (b) is not applicable the agency shall make its 
determination based on an assessment whether its own plans regarding the 
invention will better promote the policies and objectives of 35 U.S.C. 
200 than will contractor ownership of the invention. Moreover, if the 
agency is concerned only about specific uses or applications of the 
invention, it shall consider leaving title in the contractor with 
additional conditions imposed upon the contractor's use of the invention 
for such applications or with expanded government license rights in such 
applications.
    (d) A determination not to allow the contractor to retain title to a 
subject invention or to restrict or condition its title with conditions 
differing from

[[Page 625]]

those in the clause at Sec. 401.14(a), unless made by the head of the 
agency, shall be appealable by the contractor to an agency official at a 
level above the person who made the determination. This appeal shall be 
subject to the procedures applicable to appeals under Sec. 401.11 of 
this part.


<R05>
Sec. 401.16  Electronic filing.

    Unless otherwise requested or directed by the agency,
    (a) The written report required in (c)(1) of the standard clause in 
Sec. 401.14(a) may be electronically filed;
    (b) The written election required in (c)(2) of the standard clause 
in Sec. 401.14(a) may be electronically filed; and
    (c) The close-out report in (f)(1) and the information identified in 
(f)(2) and (f)(3) of Sec. 401.5 may be electronically filed.

Sec. 404.1  Scope of part.

    This part prescribes the terms, conditions, and procedures upon 
which a federally owned invention, other than an invention in the 
custody of the Tennessee Valley Authority, may be licensed. It 
supersedes the regulations at 41 CFR Subpart 101-4.1. This part does not 
affect licenses which (a) were in effect prior to July 1, 1981; (b) may 
exist at the time of the Government's acquisition of title to the 
invention, including those resulting from the allocation of rights to 
inventions made under Government research and development contracts; (c) 
are the result of an authorized exchange of rights in the settlement of 
patent disputes; or (d) are otherwise authorized by law or treaty.


<R05>
Sec. 404.2  Policy and objective.

    It is the policy and objective of this subpart to use the patent 
system to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federally 
supported research or development.


<R05>
Sec. 404.3  Definitions.

which is covered by a patent, or patent application in the United 
States, or a patent, patent application, plant variety protection, or 
other form of protection, in a foreign country, title to which has been 
assigned to or otherwise vested in the United States Government.
    (b) Federal agency means an executive department, military 
department, Government corporation, or independent establishment, except 
the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has custody of a federally owned 
invention.
    (c) Small business firm means a small business concern as defined in 
section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations

composition or product, to practice in the case of a process or method, 
or to operate in the case of a machine or system; and,

[[Page 626]]

in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention 
is being utilized and that its benefits are to the extent permitted by 
law or Government regulations available to the public on reasonable 
terms.
    (e) United States means the United States of America, its 
territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


<R05>
Sec. 404.4  Authority to grant licenses.

    Federally owned inventions shall be made available for licensing as 
deemed appropriate in the public interest. Federal agencies having 
custody of federally owned inventions may grant nonexclusive, partially 
exclusive, or exclusive licenses thereto under this part.


<R05>
Sec. 404.5  Restrictions and conditions on all licenses granted under this part.

    (a)(1) A license may be granted only if the applicant has supplied 
the Federal agency with a satifactory plan for development or marketing 
of the invention, or both, and with information about the applicant's 
capability to fulfill the plan.
    (2) A license granting rights to use or sell under a federally owned 
invention in the United States shall normally be granted only to a 
licensee who agrees that any products embodying the invention or 
produced through the use of the invention will be manufactured 
substantially in the United States.
    (b) Licenses shall contain such terms and conditions as the Federal 
agency determines are appropriate for the protection of the interests of 
the Federal Government and the public and are not in conflict with law 
or this part. The following terms and conditions apply to any license:
    (1) The duration of the license shall be for a period specified in 
the license agreement, unless sooner terminated in accordance with this 
part.
    (2) The license may be granted for all or less than all fields of 
use of the invention or in specified geographical areas, or both.
    (3) The license may extend to subsidiaries of the licensee or other 
parties if provided for in the license but shall be nonassignable 
without approval of the Federal agency, except to the successor of that 
part of the licensee's business to which the invention pertains.
    (4) The licensee may provide the license the right to grant 
sublicenses under the license, subject to the approval of the Federal 
agency. Each sublicense shall make reference to the license, including 
the rights retained by the Government, and a copy of such sublicense 
shall be furnished to the Federal agency.
    (5) The license shall require the licensee to carry out the plan for 
development or marketing of the invention, or both, to bring the 
invention to practical application within a period specified in the 
license, and to continue to make the benefits of the invention 
reasonably accessible to the public.
    (6) The license shall require the licensee to report periodically on 
the utilization or efforts at obtaining utilization that are being made 
by the licensee, with particular reference to the plan submitted.
    (7) Licenses may be royalty-free or for royalties or other 
consideration.
    (8) Where an agreement is obtained pursuant to Sec. 404.5(a)(2) that 
any products embodying the invention or produced through use of the 
invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States, the 
license shall recite such agreement.
    (9) The license shall provide for the right of the Federal agency to 
terminate the license, in whole or in part, if:
    (i) The Federal agency determines that the licensee is not executing 
the plan submitted with its request for a license and the licensee 
cannot otherwise demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Federal agency 
that it has taken or can be expected to take within a reasonable time 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention;
    (ii) The Federal agency determines that such action is necessary to 
meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations issued 
after the date of the license and such requirements are not reasonably 
satisfied by the licensee;
    (iii) The licensee has willfully made a false statement of or 
willfully omitted a material fact in the license application or in any 
report required by the license agreement; or

[[Page 627]]

    (iv) The licensee commits a substantial breach of a covenant or 
agreement contained in the license.
    (10) The license may be modified or terminated, consistent with this 
part, upon mutual agreement of the Federal agency and the licensee.
    (11) Nothing relating to the grant of a license, nor the grant 
itself, shall be construed to confer upon any person any immunity from 
or defenses under the antitrust laws or from a charge of patent misuse, 
and the acquisition and use of rights pursuant to this part shall not be 
immunized from the operation of state or Federal law by reason of the 
source of the grant.


<R05>
Sec. 404.6  Nonexclusive licenses.

    (a) Nonexclusive licenses may be granted under federally owned 
inventions without publication of availability or notice of a 
prospective license.
    (b) In addition to the provisions of Sec. 404.5, the nonexclusive 
license may also provide that, after termination of a period specified 
in the license agreement, the Federal agency may restrict the license to 
the fields of use or geographic areas, or both, in which the licensee 
has brought the invention to practical application and continues to make 
the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. 
However, such restriction shall be made only in order to grant an 
exclusive or partially exclusive license in accordance with this 
subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 404.7  Exclusive and partially exclusive licenses.

    (a)(1) Exclusive or partially exclusive domestic licenses may be 
granted on federally owned inventions three months after notice of the 
invention's availability has been announced in the Federal Register, or 
without such notice where the Federal agency determines that expeditious 
granting of such a license will best serve the interest of the Federal 
Government and the public; and in either situation, only if;
    (i) Notice of a prospective license, identifying the invention and 
the prospective licensee, has been published in the Federal Register, 
providing opportunity for written objections within at least a 15-day 
period;
    (ii) After expiration of the period in Sec. 404.7(a)(1)(i) and 
consideration of any written objections received during the period, the 
Federal agency has determined that;
    (A) The interests of the Federal Government and the public will best 
be served by the proposed license, in view of the applicant's 
intentions, plans, and ability to bring the invention to practical 
application or otherwise promote the invention's utilization by the 
public;
    (B) The desired practical application has not been achieved, or is 
not likely expeditiously to be achieved, under any nonexclusive license 
which has been granted, or which may be granted, on the invention;
    (C) Exclusive or partially exclusive licensing is a reasonable and 
necessary incentive to call forth the investment of risk capital and 
expenditures to bring the invention to practical application or 
otherwise promote the invention's utilization by the public; and
    (D) The proposed terms and scope of exclusivity are not greater than 
reasonably necessary to provide the incentive for bringing the invention 
to practical application or otherwise promote the invention's 
utilization by the public;
    (iii) The Federal agency has not determined that the grant of such 
license will tend substantially to lessen competition or result in undue 
concentration in any section of the country in any line of commerce to 
which the technology to be licensed relates, or to create or maintain 
other situations inconsistent with the antitrust laws; and
    (iv) The Federal agency has given first preference to any small 
business firms submitting plans that are determined by the agency to be 
within the capabilities of the firms and as equally likely, if executed, 
to bring the invention to practical application as any plans submitted 
by applicants that are not small business firms.
    (2) In addition to the provisions of Sec. 404.5, the following terms 
and conditions apply to domestic exclusive and partially exclusive 
licenses;
    (i) The license shall be subject to the irrevocable, royalty-free 
right of the Government of the United States to

[[Page 628]]

practice and have practiced the invention on behalf of the United States 
and on behalf of any foreign government or international organization 
pursuant to any existing or future treaty or agreement with the United 
States.
    (ii) The license shall reserve to the Federal agency the right to 
require the licensee to grant sublicenses to responsible applicants, on 
reasonable terms, when necessary to fulfill health or safety needs.
    (iii) The license shall be subject to any licenses in force at the 
time of the grant of the exclusive or partially exclusive license.
    (iv) The license may grant the licensee the right of enforcement of 
the licensed patent pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 29 of Title 
35, United States Code, or other statutes, as determined appropriate in 
the public interest.
    (b)(1) Exclusive or partially exclusive licenses may be granted on a 
federally owned invention covered by a foreign patent, patent 
application, or other form of protection, provided that;
    (i) Notice of a prospective license, identifying the invention and 
the prospective licensee, has been published in the Federal Register, 
providing opportunity for written objections within at least a 15-day 
period and following consideration of such written objections received 
during the period.
    (ii) The agency has considered whether the interests of the Federal 
Government or United States industry in foreign commerce will be 
enhanced; and
    (iii) The Federal agency has not determined that the grant of such 
license will tend substantially to lessen competition or result in undue 
concentration in any section of the United States in any line of 
commerce to which the technology to be licensed relates, or to create or 
maintain other situations inconsistent with antitrust laws.
    (2) In addition to the provisions of Sec. 404.5 the following terms 
and conditions apply to foreign exclusive and partially exclusive 
licenses:
    (i) The license shall be subject to the irrevocable, royalty-free 
right of the Government of the United States to practice and have 
practiced the invention on behalf of the United States and on behalf of 
any foreign government or international organization pursuant to any 
existing or future treaty or agreement with the United States.
    (ii) The license shall be subject to any licenses in force at the 
time of the grant of the exclusive or partially exclusive license.
    (iii) The license may grant the licensee the right to take any 
suitable and necessary actions to protect the licensed property, on 
behalf of the Federal Government.
    (c) Federal agencies shall maintain a record of determinations to 
grant exclusive or partially exclusive licenses.

[61 FR 40999, Aug. 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 501.4  Determination of inventions and rights.

    Each Government agency has the approval of the Secretary to 
determine whether the results of research, development, or other 
activity in the agency constitute an invention within the purview of 
Executive Order 10096, as amended by Executive Order 10930 and Executive 
Order 10695, and to determine the rights in and to the invention in 
accordance with the provisions of Secs. 501.6 and 501.7.

[61 FR 40999, Aug. 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 501.5  Agency liaison officer.

    Each Government agency shall designate a liaison officer to 
represent the agency before the Secretary; Provided, however, that the 
Departments of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force may each designate 
a liaison officer.

[[Page 634]]


<R05>
Sec. 501.6  Criteria for the determination of rights in and to inventions.

    (a) The following rules shall be applied in determining the 
respective rights of the Government and of the inventor in and to any 
invention that is subject to the provisions of this part:
    (1) The Government shall obtain, except as herein otherwise 
provided, the entire right, title and interest in and to any invention 
made by any Government employee:
    (i) During working hours, or
    (ii) With a contribution by the Government of facilities, equipment, 
materials, funds or information, or of time or services of other 
Government employees on official duty, or
    (iii) Which bears a direct relation to or is made in consequence of 
the official duties of the inventor.
    (2) In any case where the contribution of the Government, as 
measured by any one or more of the criteria set forth in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, to the invention is insufficient equitably to 
justify a requirement of assignment to the Government of the entire 
right, title and interest in and to such invention, or in any case where 
the Government has insufficient interest in an invention to obtain the 
entire right, title and interest therein (although the Government could 
obtain same under paragraph (a)(1) of this section), the Government 
agency concerned shall leave title to such invention in the employee, 
subject however, to the reservation to the Government of a nonexclusive, 
irrevocable, royalty-free license in the invention with power to grant 
licenses for all governmental purposes. The terms of such reservation 
will appear, where practicable, in any patent, domestic or foreign, 
which may issue on such invention. Reference is made to section 15 of 
the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 3710d) which 
requires a Government agency to allow the inventor to retain title to 
any covered invention when the agency does not intend to file a patent 
application or otherwise promote commercialization.
    (3) In applying the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this 
section to the facts and circumstances relating to the making of a 
particular invention, it shall be presumed that an invention made by an 
employee who is employed or assigned:
    (i) To invent or improve or perfect any art or process, machine, 
design, manufacture, or composition of matter;
    (ii) To conduct or perform research, development work, or both,
    (iii) To supervise, direct, coordinate, or review Government 
financed or conducted research, development work, or both, or
    (iv) To act in a liaison capacity among governmental or non-
governmental agencies or individuals engaged in such research or 
development work,

falls within the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and it 
shall be presumed that any invention made by any other employee falls 
within the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Either 
presumption may be rebutted by a showing of the facts and circumstances 
in the case and shall not preclude a determination that these facts and 
circumstances justify leaving the entire right, title and interest in 
and to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.
    (4) In any case wherein the Government neither:
    (i) Obtains the entire right, title and interest in and to an 
invention pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
nor
    (ii) Reserves a nonexclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license in 
the invention, with power to grant licenses for all governmental 
purposes, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section,

the Government shall leave the entire right, title and interest in and 
to the invention in the Government employee, subject to law.

[53 FR 39735, Oct. 11, 1988, as amended at 61 FR 40999, Aug. 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 501.7  Agency determination.

    (a) If the agency determines that the Government is entitled to 
obtain title pursuant to Sec. 501.6(a)(1) and the employee does not 
appeal, no further review is required.
    (b) In the event that a Government agency determines, pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(4) of Sec. 501.6, that title to an invention 
will be left with the employee, the agency shall notify the

[[Page 635]]

employee of this determination. In cases pursuant to Sec. 501.6(a)(2) 
where the Government's insufficient interest in the invention is 
evidenced by its decision not to file a patent application, the agency 
may impose on the employee any one or all of the following conditions or 
any other conditions that may be necessary in a particular case:
    (1) That a patent application be filed in the United States and/or 
abroad, if the Government has determined that it has or may need to 
practice the invention;
    (2) That the invention not be assigned to any foreign-owned or 
controlled corporation without the written permission of the agency; and
    (3) That any assignment or license of rights to use or sell the 
invention in the United States shall contain a requirement that any 
products embodying the invention or produced through the use of the 
invention be substantially manufactured in the United States. The agency 
shall notify the employee of any conditions imposed.
    (c) In the case of a determination under either paragraph (a) or (b) 
of this section, the agency shall promptly provide the employee with:
    (1) A signed and dated statement of its determination and reasons 
therefor; and
    (2) A copy of 37 CFR part 501.

[53 FR 39735, Oct. 11, 1988, as amended at 61 FR 40999, Aug. 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 501.8  Appeals by employees.

    (a) Any Government employee who is aggrieved by a Government agency 
determination pursuant to Secs. 501.6(a)(1) or (a)(2), may obtain a 
review of any agency determination by filing, within 30 days (or such 
longer period as the Secretary may, for good cause shown in writing, fix 
in any case) after receiving notice of such determination, two copies of 
an appeal with the Secretary. The Secretary then shall forward one copy 
of the appeal to the liaison officer of the Government agency.
    (b) On receipt of a copy of an appeal filed pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section, the agency liaison officer shall, subject to 
considerations of national security, or public health, safety or 
welfare, promptly furnish both the Secretary and the inventor with a 
copy of a report containing the following information about the 
invention involved in the appeal:
    (1) A copy of the agency's statement specified in Sec. 501.7(c);
    (2) A description of the invention in sufficient detail to identify 
the invention and show its relationship to the employee's duties and 
work assignments;
    (3) The name of the employee and employment status, including a 
detailed statement of official duties and responsibilities at the time 
the invention was made; and
    (4) A detailed statement of the points of dispute or controversy, 
together with copies of any statements or written arguments filed with 
the agency, and of any other relevant evidence that the agency 
considered in making its determination of Government interest.
    (c) Within 25 days (or such longer period as the Secretary may, for 
good cause shown, fix in any case) after the transmission of a copy of 
the agency report to the employee, the employee may file a reply with 
the Secretary and file one copy with the agency liaison officer.
    (d) After the time for the inventor's reply to the Government 
agency's report has expired and if the inventor has so requested in his 
or her appeal, a date will be set for hearing of oral arguments before 
the Secretary, by the employee (or by an attorney whom he or she 
designates by written power of attorney filed before, or at the hearing) 
and a representative of the Government agency involved. Unless it shall 
be otherwise ordered before the hearing begins, oral arguments will be 
limited to thirty minutes for each side. The employee need not retain an 
attorney or request an oral hearing to secure full consideration of the 
facts and his or her arguments. The employee may expedite such 
consideration by notifying the Secretary when he or she does not intend 
to file a reply to the agency report.
    (e) After a hearing on the appeal, if a hearing was requested, or 
after expiration of the period for the inventor's reply to the agency 
report if no hearing is set, the Secretary shall issue a decision on the 
matter within 120 days, which decision shall be final after a

[[Page 636]]

thirty day period for requesting reconsideration expires or on the date 
that a decision on a petition for reconsideration is finally disposed 
of. Any request for reconsideration or modification of the decision must 
be filed within 30 days from the date of the original decision (or 
within such an extension thereof as may be set by the Secretary before 
the original period expires). The decision of the Secretary shall be 
made after consideration of the statements of fact in the employee's 
appeal, the agency's report, and the employee's reply, but the Secretary 
at his or her discretion and with due respect to the rights and 
convenience of the inventor and the Government agency, may call for 
further statements on specific questions of fact or may request 
additional evidence in the form of affidavits or depositions on specific 
facts in dispute.

[53 FR 39735, Oct. 11, 1988, as amended at 61 FR 41000, Aug. 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 501.9  Patent protection.

    (a) A Government agency, upon determining that an invention coming 
within the scope of Secs. 501.6(a)(1) or (a)(2) has been made, shall 
promptly determine whether patent protection will be sought in the 
United States by or on behalf of the agency for such invention. A 
controversy over the respective rights of the Government and of the 
employee shall not unnecessarily delay the filing of a patent 
application by the agency to avoid the loss of patent rights. In cases 
coming within the scope of Sec. 501.6(a)(2), the filing of a patent 
application shall be contingent upon the consent of the employee.
    (b) Where there is an appealed dispute as to whether Secs. 501.6 
(a)(1) or (a)(2) applies in determining the respective rights of the 
Government and of an employee in and to any invention, the agency may 
determine whether patent protection will be sought in the United States 
pending the Secretary's decision on the dispute. If the agency decides 
that an application for patent should be filed, the agency will take 
such rights as are specified in Sec. 501.6(a)(2), but this shall be 
without prejudice to acquiring the rights specified in paragraph (a)(1) 
of that section should the Secretary so decide.
    (c) Where an agency has determined to leave title to an invention 
with an employee under Sec. 501.6(a)(2), the agency will, upon the 
filing of an application for patent, take the rights specified in that 
paragraph without prejudice to the subsequent acquisition by the 
Government of the rights specified in paragraph (a)(1) of that section 
should the Secretary so decide.
    (d) Where an agency has filed a patent application in the United 
States, the agency will, within 8 months from the filing date of the 
U.S. application, determine if any foreign patent applications should 
also be filed. If the agency chooses not to file an application in any 
foreign country, the employee may request rights in that country subject 
to the conditions stated in Sec. 501.7(b) that may be imposed by the 
agency. Alternatively, the agency may permit the employee to retain 
foreign rights by including in any assignment to the Government of an 
unclassified U.S. patent application on the invention an option for the 
Government to acquire title in any foreign country within 8 months from 
the filing date of the U.S. application.

[61 FR 41000, Aug. 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 501.10  Dissemination of this part and of implementing regulations.

    Each Government agency shall disseminate to its employees the 
provisions of this part, and any appropriate implementing agency 
regulations and delegations. Copies of any such regulations shall be 
sent to the Secretary. If the Secretary identifies an inconsistency 
between this part and the agency regulations or delegations, the agency, 
upon being informed by the Secretary of the inconsistency, shall take 
prompt action to correct it.


<R05>
Sec. 501.11  Submissions and inquiries.

    All submissions or inquiries should be directed to Chief Counsel for 
Technology, telephone number 202-482-1984, Room H4835, U.S. Department 
of Commerce, Washington DC 20230.
