              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2004 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2004 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 7749 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2004 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2005, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
     statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
 Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
      Division by Stephen J. Frattini and Kathleen M. Fargey, under the 
supervision of Gwendolyn J. Henderson. Karen L. Ashlin, John S. Ashlin, 
                          and Loretta F. Cochran were assistant editors.

Proclamation 7749 of January 9, 2004

National Mentoring Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Mentoring reflects the great strength of America--the heart and soul of 
the American people. During National Mentoring Month, we recognize the 
dedicated individuals who volunteer their time to mentor young people, 
and we encourage more citizens to give back to their communities as 
mentors.
Mentors are friends, teachers, and role models. They open doors of 
opportunity, convey values, and help provide the stability and 
encouragement that young people need to succeed. By spending time with a 
child and showing compassion and guidance, a mentor can profoundly 
affect a young life. Research shows that adolescents who have an adult 
mentor are far less likely to engage in high-risk behaviors. Mentoring 
relationships create continuing cycles of hope and promise, as they not 
only provide positive influences for individual children, but also 
strengthen families and communities.
My Administration is working to expand mentoring and other volunteer 
activities across America. Through the USA Freedom Corps, we are 
promoting volunteer service and offering our citizens more opportunities 
to help others. We are also supporting faith-based and community 
organizations, including many who sponsor mentoring programs. In total, 
more than 63 million Americans volunteered in their communities over the 
past year--approximately 4 million more than the previous year.
The Department of Education will use Federal funds to work with national 
youth-serving organizations, independent community groups, and local

[[Page 2]]

education agencies to develop, expand, and strengthen school-based 
mentoring programs for disadvantaged middle school students. In 
addition, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of 
Justice, and other agencies will offer grants to help youth- serving 
organizations recruit and train adult mentors for nearly 100,000 
children whose parents are incarcerated.
These efforts are an important part of our ongoing work to ensure that 
every child can realize the great promise of America. Every life has 
value and potential, and all deserve the opportunity to have a bright 
future. By supporting the individuals and organizations involved in 
mentoring and by encouraging more citizens to participate in their good 
works, we can transform America, one heart and one soul at a time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2004 as National 
Mentoring Month. I call upon the people of the United States to 
recognize the importance of mentoring, to look for opportunities to 
serve as mentors in their communities, and to celebrate this month with 
appropriate activities and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.
GEORGE W. BUSH


<R05>
Proclamation 7750 of January 12, 2004

To Suspend Entry as Immigrants or Nonimmigrants of Persons Engaged In or 
Benefiting From Corruption

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In light of the importance of legitimate and transparent public 
institutions to world stability, peace, and development, and the serious 
negative effects that corruption of public institutions has on the 
United States efforts to promote security and to strengthen democratic 
institutions and free market systems, and in light of the importance to 
the United States and the international community of fighting 
corruption, as evidenced by the Third Global Forum on Fighting 
Corruption and Safeguarding Integrity and other intergovernmental 
efforts, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United 
States to take action to restrict the international travel and to 
suspend the entry into the United States, as immigrants or 
nonimmigrants, of certain persons who have committed, participated in, 
or are beneficiaries of corruption in the performance of public 
functions where that corruption has serious adverse effects on 
international activity of U.S. businesses, U.S. foreign assistance 
goals, the security of the United States against transnational crime and 
terrorism, or the stability of democratic institutions and nations.

[[Page 3]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws

Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), and section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and 
nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons described in

I therefore hereby proclaim that:
Section 1. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or 
nonimmigrants, of the following persons is hereby suspended:
    (a) Public officials or former public officials whose solicitation

of the United States.
    (c) Public officials or former public officials whose 
misappropriation of public funds or interference with the judicial, 
electoral, or other public processes has or had serious adverse effects 
on the national interests of the United States.
    (d) The spouses, children, and dependent household members of 
persons described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) above, who are 
beneficiaries of any articles of monetary value or other benefits 
obtained by such persons.
Sec. 2. Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply with respect to 
any person otherwise covered by section 1 where entry of the person into 
the United States would not be contrary to the interests of the United 
States.

be identified by the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee, in 
his or her sole discretion, pursuant to such standards and procedures as

the national interests of the United States'' means serious adverse

foreign assistance goals, the security of the United States against 
transnational crime and terrorism, or the stability of democratic 
institutions and nations.
Sec. 5. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to derogate from 
United States Government obligations under applicable international 
agreements.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of State shall have responsibility for 
implementing this proclamation pursuant to such procedures as the 
Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, establish.
Sec. 7. This proclamation is effective immediately.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7751 of January 15, 2004

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, our Nation honors an 
American who dedicated his life to the fundamental principles of 
freedom, opportunity, and equal justice for all. Today, all Americans 
benefit from Dr. King's work and his legacy of courage, dignity, and 
moral clarity.
Forty years ago this past August, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, 
Dr. King spoke passionately of his dream for America. He dreamed of an 
America where all citizens would be judged by the content of their 
character and not by the color of their skin. He dreamed of an America 
where all would enjoy the riches of freedom and the security of justice. 
He dreamed of an America where the doors of opportunity would be open to 
all of God's children.
Dr. King's leadership moved Americans to examine our hearts--to reject 
what he called the ``tranquilizing drug of gradualism'' on the path to 
racial justice--and to live up to the ideals of our Constitution and 
Declaration of Independence. America has come far in realizing Dr. 
King's dream, but there is still work to be done. In remembering Dr. 
King's vision and life of service, we renew our commitment to 
guaranteeing the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness for all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 19, 2004, 
as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all 
Americans to observe this day with appropriate activities and programs 
that honor the memory and legacy of Dr. King.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7752 of January 15, 2004

National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, we are led by the power of our conscience and the history 
of our country to defend and promote the dignity and rights of all 
people. Each person, however frail or defenseless, has a place and a 
purpose in this world. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we 
celebrate the gift of life and our commitment to building a society of 
compassion and humanity.
Today, the principles of human dignity enshrined in the Declaration of 
Independence--that all persons are created equal and possess the 
unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--
continue to guide us. In November, I signed into law the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act of 2003, reaffirming our commitment to protecting 
innocent life and to a basic standard of humanity--the duty of the 
strong to defend the weak. My Administration encourages adoption and 
supports abstinence education, crisis pregnancy programs, parental 
notification laws, and other measures to help us continue to build a 
culture of life. By working together, we will provide hope to the 
weakest among us and achieve a more compassionate and merciful world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, January 18, 2004, 
as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. I call upon all Americans to 
recognize this day with appropriate ceremonies in our homes and places 
of worship and to reaffirm our commitment to respecting the life and 
dignity of every human being.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7753 of January 16, 2004

Religious Freedom Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America is a land of many faiths, and the right to religious freedom is 
a foundation of our Nation. On Religious Freedom Day, Americans 
acknowledge the centrality of their faith and reaffirm that the great 
strength of our country is the heart and soul of our citizens.

[[Page 6]]

Religious Freedom Day celebrates the passage of the Virginia Statute for 
Religious Freedom on January 16, 1786. Thomas Jefferson, drafter of the 
legislation, considered it one of his three greatest accomplishments, 
along with writing the Declaration of Independence and founding the 
University of Virginia. Recognizing the importance of faith to our 
people, our Founding Fathers guaranteed religious freedom in the 
Constitution.
Protecting our religious freedom requires the vigilance of the American 
people and of government at all levels. Within my Administration, the 
Department of Justice is acting to protect religious freedom, including 
prosecuting those who attack people or places of worship because of 
religious affiliation. The Department of Education has issued new 
guidelines that allow students to engage in constitutionally protected 
religious activity in public schools. These guidelines protect, for 
example, students' rights to say a prayer before meals in the cafeteria, 
to gather with other students before school to pray, and to engage in 
other expressions of personal faith.
Through my Faith-Based and Community Initiative, my Administration 
continues to encourage the essential work of faith-based and community 
organizations. Governments can and should support effective social 
services, including those provided by religious people and 
organizations. When government gives that support, it is important that 
faith-based institutions not be forced to change their religious 
character. In December 2002, I signed an Executive Order to end 
discrimination against faith-based organizations in the Federal grants 
process. In September 2003, in implementing this order, my 
Administration eliminated many of the barriers that have kept faith-
based charities from partnering with the Federal Government to help 
Americans in need. Six Federal agencies have proposed or finalized new 
regulations to ensure that no organization or beneficiary will be 
discriminated against in a Federally funded social service program on 
the basis of religion.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2004, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I urge all Americans to reflect on the blessings 
of our religious freedom and to observe this day through appropriate 
events and activities in homes, schools, and places of worship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7754 of February 2, 2004

American Heart Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. It 
affects men and women of every age and race. During American Heart 
Month, we

[[Page 7]]

encourage all Americans to join the fight against heart disease and to 
learn more about how to prevent it.
More than 64 million Americans suffer from one or more forms of 
cardiovascular disease, including high blood pressure, coronary heart 
disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, and congenital heart defects. 
Many of the risk factors that can lead to heart disease, such as high 
blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes, can be prevented 
or controlled. Research has shown that men and women who lead healthy 
lifestyles, including making healthy food choices, getting regular 
exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and choosing not to smoke or 
drink excessively, can significantly decrease their risk of heart 
disease.
Heart disease is responsible for the deaths of one in three women in the 
United States. To make women more aware of the danger of heart disease, 
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes 
of Health has joined with the Department of Health and Human Services 
and other national organizations to launch a nationwide campaign called 
``The Heart Truth.'' This important campaign encourages women to learn 
more about heart health, to lead healthier lives, and to talk with their 
doctors about their risk for developing heart disease.
During American Heart Month, I urge all Americans to learn more about 
heart health and to reduce their risk factors for serious heart 
conditions. By making healthy choices, we can live longer and better 
lives.
In recognition of the important ongoing fight against heart disease, the 
Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended (77 
Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an 
annual proclamation designating February as ``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2004 as American Heart Month. I 
invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, and the American people to join me in reaffirming our commitment 
to combating heart disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7755 of February 2, 2004

National Consumer Protection Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, America's consumers conduct millions of financial 
transactions. During National Consumer Protection Week, we recognize 
those who help to safeguard our citizens from consumer fraud, and we 
encourage all Americans to be informed consumers. This year's theme, 
``Financial Literacy:

[[Page 8]]

Earning a Lifetime of Dividends,'' highlights the importance of 
financial education to consumer protection.
The Federal Government provides many educational resources and programs 
to help protect Americans against fraud by giving them information about 
their options in the marketplace. The Federal Trade Commission and more 
than 100 other Federal agencies have collaborated on a website, 
www.consumer.gov, which provides helpful information ranging from how 
credit ratings work to how to buy a new car. The Department of the 
Treasury has also established an Office of Financial Education to 
oversee inter agency efforts to coordinate and expand financial 
education initiatives.
In addition, my Administration is working to expand financial literacy 
for potential homeowners. We have doubled the funds for housing and 
financial counseling services, including those run by faith-based and 
community groups, and we are distributing millions of dollars in grants 
to national, State, and local organizations that promote home buyer 
education and counseling. The Department of Housing and Urban 
Development is also collaborating with the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation to expand the ``Money Smart'' financial education program in 
public housing. Education about the home-buying process not only 
protects our citizens from consumer fraud, but also empowers them to 
achieve their dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 1 through 
February 7, 2004, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon 
government officials, industry leaders, and consumer advocates to 
provide consumers with information about the lifetime benefits of 
financial literacy, and I encourage all citizens to take advantage of 
the resources that can help them become responsible consumers, savers, 
and investors.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7756 of February 3, 2004

National African American History Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National African American History Month, we honor the heritage 
and accomplishments of African Americans and recognize their 
extraordinary contributions to the United States.
African Americans have upheld the ideals of America, defended our 
homeland, and enriched American culture and society. Brave leaders such 
as Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther 
King, Jr., and Leon Sullivan caused America to examine its heart and to 
respect the dignity and equality of all people, regardless of race. 
Today, African

[[Page 9]]

Americans are leaders at the highest levels of the military, business, 
education, law, government, the arts, sports, and religion.
To help share the stories of the millions of African Americans who have 
strengthened our country, I recently signed legislation establishing the 
National Museum of African American History and Culture as a part of the 
Smithsonian Institution. This museum will commemorate the triumphs of 
African Americans--their determination in overcoming the evil of slavery 
and discrimination and their many achievements and contributions to our 
Nation.
This year's National African American History Month celebrates the 50th 
anniversary of the Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of 
Education. In that landmark decision, the Supreme Court declared an end 
to the shameful and unconstitutional practice of legal segregation in 
schools, ruling unanimously that the Constitution requires all Americans 
to be treated equally without regard to the color of their skin. The 
Brown decision transformed America and fulfilled the principles of our 
Constitution. This year, we remember the brave schoolchildren and 
parents who challenged segregation. We recognize the legal and moral 
advocates who paved the way for this decision, including Thurgood 
Marshall, the heroic lawyer who represented Linda Brown and fought for 
her rights and the rights of all African Americans. We remember the nine 
justices of the Supreme Court who helped America begin to make equal 
justice under law a reality for African Americans. Nearly 50 years after 
Brown, we are grateful for the progress America has made, but we also 
recognize that there is still work to be done to ensure that our country 
lives up to the founding principle that all of God's children are 
created equal.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2004 as National 
African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate programs and activities that highlight and honor 
the contributions African Americans have made to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7757 of February 26, 2004

Expanding the Scope of the National Emergency and Invocation of 
Emergency Authority Relating To the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels into Cuban Territorial Waters

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States of America, in order to expand the scope of the national 
emergency declared in Proclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996, based on the 
disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations of 
the United States caused by actions taken by the Cuban government, and 
in light of steps taken over the past year by the Cuban government to 
worsen the threat to United States international relations, and,
WHEREAS the United States has determined that Cuba is a state-sponsor of 
terrorism and it is subject to the restrictions of section 6(j)(1)(A) of 
the Export Administration Act of 1979, section 620A of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, and section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act;
WHEREAS the Cuban government has demonstrated a ready and reckless 
willingness to use excessive force, including deadly force, against U.S. 
citizens, in the ostensible enforcement of its sovereignty, including 
the February 1996 shoot-down of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian 
aircraft in international airspace, resulting in the deaths of three 
American citizens and one other individual;
WHEREAS the Cuban government has demonstrated a ready and reckless 
willingness to use excessive force, including deadly force, against U.S. 
citizens and its own citizens, including on July 13, 1995, when persons 
in U.S.-registered vessels that entered into Cuban territorial waters 
suffered injury as a result of the reckless use of force against them by 
the Cuban military, and including the July 1994 sinking of an unarmed 
Cuban-registered vessel, resulting in the deaths of 41 Cuban citizens;
WHEREAS the Cuban government has impounded U.S.-registered vessels in 
Cuban ports and forced the owners, as a condition of release, to violate 
U.S. law by requiring payments to be made to the Cuban government;
WHEREAS the entry of any U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial 
waters could result in injury to, or loss of life of, persons engaged in 
that conduct, due to the potential use of excessive force, including 
deadly force, against them by the Cuban military, and could threaten a 
disturbance of international relations;
WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States into Cuban territorial waters is in violation of U.S. 
law and contrary to U.S. policy;
WHEREAS the objectives of U.S. policy regarding Cuba are the end of the 
dictatorship and a rapid, peaceful transition to a representative 
democracy respectful of human rights and characterized by an open market 
economic system;

[[Page 11]]

WHEREAS a critical initiative by the United States to advance these U.S. 
objectives is to deny resources to the repressive Cuban government, 
resources that may be used by that government to support terrorist 
activities and carry out excessive use of force against innocent 
victims, including U.S. citizens;
WHEREAS the unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban 
territorial waters is detrimental to the foreign policy of the United 
States, which is to deny monetary and material support to the repressive 
Cuban government, and, therefore, such unauthorized entries threaten to 
disturb the international relations of the United States by facilitating 
the Cuban government's support of terrorism, use of excessive force, and 
continued existence;
WHEREAS the Cuban government has over the course of its 45-year 
existence repeatedly used violence and the threat of violence to 
undermine U.S. policy interests. This same regime continues in power 
today, and has since 1959 maintained a pattern of hostile actions 
contrary to U.S. policy interests. Among other things, the Cuban 
government established a military alliance with the Soviet Union, and 
invited Soviet forces to install nuclear missiles in Cuba capable of 
attacking the United States, and encouraged Soviet authorities to use 
those weapons against the United States; it engaged in military 
adventurism in Africa; and it helped to form and provide material and 
political support to terrorist organizations that sought the violent 
overthrow of democratically elected governments in Central America and 
elsewhere in the hemisphere allied with the United States, thereby 
causing repeated disturbances of U.S. international relations;
WHEREAS the Cuban government has recently and over the last year taken a 
series of steps to destabilize relations with the United States, 
including threatening to abrogate the Migration Accords with the United 
States and to close the U.S. Interests Section, and Cuba's most senior 
officials repeatedly asserting that the United States intended to invade 
Cuba, despite explicit denials from the U.S. Secretaries of State and 
Defense that such action is planned, thereby causing a sudden and 
worsening disturbance of U.S. international relations;
WHEREAS U.S. concerns about these unforeseen Cuban government actions 
that threaten to disturb international relations were sufficiently grave 
that on May 8, 2003, the United States warned the Cuban government that 
political manipulations that resulted in a mass migration would be 
viewed as a ``hostile act;''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws 
of the United States of America, including section 1 of title II of 
Public Law 65-24, ch. 30, June 15, 1917, as amended (50 U.S.C. 191), 
sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, in order to 
expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Proclamation 6867 
of March 1, 1996, and to secure the observance of the rights and 
obligations of the United States, hereby authorize and direct the 
Secretary of Homeland Security (the ``Secretary'') to make and issue 
such rules and regulations as the Secretary may find appropriate to 
regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels, and authorize and 
approve the Secretary's issuance of such rules and regulations, as 
authorized by the Act of June 15, 1917.

[[Page 12]]

Section 1. The Secretary may make rules and regulations governing the 
anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the 
territorial waters of the United States, which may be used, or is 
susceptible of being used, for voyage into Cuban territorial waters and 
that may create unsafe conditions, or result in unauthorized 
transactions, and thereby threaten a disturbance of international 
relations. Any rule or regulation issued pursuant to this proclamation 
may be effective immediately upon issuance as such rule or regulation 
shall involve a foreign affairs function of the United States.
Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized to inspect any vessel, foreign or 
domestic, in the territorial waters of the United States, at any time; 
to place guards on any such vessel; and, with my consent expressly 
hereby granted, take full possession and control of any such vessel and 
remove the officers and crew and all other persons not specifically 
authorized by the Secretary to go or remain on board the vessel when 
necessary to secure the rights and obligations of the United States.
Sec. 3. The Secretary may request assistance from such departments, 
agencies, officers, or instrumentalities of the United States as the 
Secretary deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this 
proclamation. Such departments, agencies, officers, or instrumentalities 
shall, consistent with other provisions of law and to the extent 
practicable, provide requested assistance.
Sec. 4. The Secretary may seek assistance from State and local 
authorities in carrying out the purposes of this proclamation. Because 
State and local assistance may be essential for an effective response to 
this emergency, I urge all State and local officials to cooperate with 
Federal authorities and to take all actions within their lawful 
authority necessary to prevent the unauthorized departure of vessels 
intending to enter Cuban territorial waters.
Sec. 5. All powers and authorities delegated by this proclamation to the 
Secretary may be delegated by the Secretary to other officers and agents 
of the United States Government unless otherwise prohibited by law.
Sec. 6. Any provisions of Proclamation 6867 that are inconsistent with 
the provisions of this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such 
inconsistency.
Sec. 7. This proclamation shall be immediately transmitted to the 
Congress and published in the Federal Register.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

that such country has become a ``high income'' country as defined by the 
official statistics of the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. Termination is effective on January 1 of the second year 
following the year in which such determination is made.
4. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a)(1) of the Act, and having due 
regard for the factors set forth in section 501 of the Act and taking

substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts 
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the 
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or 
other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including title V and section

Proclamation 7759 of March 3, 2004

American Red Cross Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The American Red Cross was founded in 1881 by Clara Barton and chartered 
by the Congress in 1905 to provide humanitarian services to the United 
States in times of need. Today, the Red Cross remains dedicated to 
relieving suffering by helping our citizens prepare for and respond to 
emergencies and natural disasters.
The Red Cross exemplifies one of the great strengths of America--the 
compassion of our people. Each year, the Red Cross responds to tens of 
thousands of disasters in the United States, from home fires and 
earthquakes to tornadoes and chemical spills. In Afghanistan and Iraq, 
the Red Cross is serving military families by delivering emergency 
messages between deployed members of our Armed Forces and their 
families. Through International Response Teams, the Red Cross provides 
vital aid overseas to the victims of disease, famine, war, and natural 
disasters. The Red Cross also educates individuals, families, schools, 
businesses, and communities about the importance of disaster 
preparedness, especially after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001. By offering health and safety training such as first aid, CPR, and 
aquatic lifesaving, and by facilitating the collection of millions of 
units of blood for donation, the Red Cross helps our country to handle 
emergencies.
Many of the essential services of the American Red Cross are provided by 
volunteers who give their time and energy to help fellow citizens in 
need. During Red Cross relief operations, these volunteers assess 
damages, drive emergency response vehicles to distribute food and other 
supplies to people, and shelter families who have been evacuated from 
their homes. As we celebrate American Red Cross Month, I encourage all 
Americans to commit themselves to helping others by volunteering in 
their communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim March 2004 as American Red Cross Month. I 
urge all Americans to support this organization's humanitarian mission. 
On behalf of a grateful Nation, we also applaud the selfless dedication 
of Red Cross employees and volunteers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7760 of March 5, 2004

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Millions of Americans trace their ancestry to Ireland's shores. During 
Irish-American Heritage Month, we recognize these proud citizens and 
their important contributions to America.
Irish Americans have helped settle the American frontier, build our 
cities, and defend our homeland. Through their service in government and 
the military, they have helped to uphold our democracy and advance 
liberty and peace around the world. Through their dedication to faith 
and family, they have strengthened our communities and enriched our 
Nation's character.
The names of Irish Americans who have helped make America great are 
familiar. Davy Crockett and Sam Houston helped settle the West. As 
Archbishop, John Cardinal O'Connor served the people of New York with 
conviction and compassion. President John Kennedy led America with 
steadfast determination during a time of great challenge.
These and millions of other Irish Americans have made America better and 
stronger. This month, we celebrate the enormous gifts Irish Americans 
have given this Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2004 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by celebrating the contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7761 of March 5, 2004

Women's History Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Women's History Month, we celebrate the many accomplishments of 
our Nation's women.
Women are leaders in American business, government, law, science, 
medicine, the arts, education, and many other fields. As mothers, 
sisters, and daughters, they bring compassion and integrity to our 
communities and help to teach our children the values that make our 
country great.

[[Page 17]]

Women today are following in the footsteps of pioneers such as Sarah 
Pierce, Emma Willard, Catherine Beecher, and Mary Lyon, who helped open 
the doors to higher education for women in our country. Their vision and 
determination changed America forever. Women today also join a long 
tradition of defending our Nation. During the Revolutionary War, 
Margaret Cochran Corbin fought as a gunner and was severely wounded at 
the battle of Fort Washington. Today, more than 200,000 women are 
serving in our Nation's Armed Forces and working to defend America and 
advance peace and freedom. We are grateful for their sacrifice and for 
the military families that support them.
This month, we celebrate the many ways women strengthen and enrich 
America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2004 as Women's 
History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of March,

Proclamation 7762 of March 5, 2004

Save Your Vision Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Millions of Americans enjoy healthy vision. Yet, each year, many of our 
citizens suffer from vision loss that could have been prevented or 
reversed with effective detection and appropriate intervention. 
Commemorating Save Your Vision Week reminds us of the importance of 
including eye care as part of a regular preventive health routine.
Eating healthy foods, wearing safety glasses, and avoiding the harmful 
effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays are ways to help to keep our eyes 
healthy. Regular, comprehensive exams are also important to maintain 
good vision and eye health. For children, regular eye exams can help 
parents ensure that their children's vision is developing normally and 
can identify a problem before it becomes more serious. For adults, eye 
care professionals can detect glaucoma and eye damage from diabetes in 
the early stages of progression, thereby preventing further harm. 
Diabetes can seriously affect vision in addition to general health. An 
estimated 40 to 45 percent of all people diagnosed with diabetes will 
develop some degree of diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of new 
cases of blindness in working-age Americans that often presents few 
warning signs and no pain. Other eye diseases such as glaucoma may cause 
vision damage and eventual blindness without the individual being aware 
of a problem.

[[Page 18]]

The Department of Health and Human Services is working to identify 
opportunities to improve the health of all Americans through Healthy 
People 2010, a national disease prevention plan. This plan includes the 
Healthy Vision 2010 Initiative, which is addressing many of the 
challenges posed by the loss or impairment of vision.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended 
(77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and requested the 
President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as ``Save 
Your Vision Week.'' During this week, I encourage all Americans to learn 
more about ways to prevent eye problems for themselves and to help 
others maintain the precious gift of sight.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 7 through March 13, 2004, as Save Your 
Vision Week. I urge all Americans to participate by making eye care and 
eye safety an important part of their lives and to get regular eye 
examinations. I also encourage eye care professionals, teachers, the 
media, and all public and private organizations dedicated to preserving 
eyesight to join in activities that will raise awareness of the measures 
all citizens can take to protect vision.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7763 of March 19, 2004

National Poison Prevention Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, approximately 1 million calls to poison control centers are 
made because children may have ingested harmful substances. The National 
Poison Prevention Week Council organizes activities annually to raise 
awareness of the danger of unintentional poisoning and to educate adults 
about how to avoid and handle these emergencies.
Since the first National Poison Prevention Week in 1962, our Nation has 
taken important steps to protect children from consuming inappropriate 
medicines or household chemicals by heightening awareness, supporting 
poison control centers, and improving packaging. In December, I signed 
the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act Amendments of 
2003 to provide assistance for poison prevention programs and to 
stabilize the funding of regional poison control centers. This measure 
supports those who are working to reduce poisonings in America and to 
improve the safety and health of all Americans.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission requires child-resistant 
packaging for certain toxic medicines and chemicals. Because packaging 
is never completely child-proof, adults should also lock medicines and 
chemicals out of the reach of children.

[[Page 19]]

To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 21 through March 27, 2004, as National 
Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week 
by participating in appropriate activities and by learning how to 
prevent poisonings among children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7764 of March 25, 2004

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The love of liberty that helped shape our Constitution has deep roots in 
the spirit of ancient Greece. As we observe Greek Independence Day, we 
celebrate the timeless democratic principles that all freedom-loving 
people cherish.
To continue to strengthen and spread liberty around the world, the 
values and traditions of democracy must be passed on to each new 
generation. In 1821, our Nation supported the cause of Greek 
independence when the brave men and women of Greece began their long 
struggle for liberty. This struggle continued through the end of World 
War II. On the anniversary of the Greek Declaration of Independence, we 
honor the courage of these proud patriots and celebrate our nations' 
shared commitment to democracy.
Today, Greece and America are strong allies and strategic partners in 
the great struggles for liberty and the global war on terror. We are 
working together to bring a fair and lasting settlement to Cyprus. We 
look forward to a future of continued friendship and collaboration 
between our two great nations as we advance peace and democracy in the 
world.
In celebrating Greek Independence Day, we are also grateful for the many 
ways Greek Americans have enriched our communities and strengthened our 
country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2004, as Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American

[[Page 20]]

Democracy. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with

Proclamation 7765 of April 2, 2004

Cancer Control Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We have made dramatic progress in our fight against cancer, yet this 
disease continues to be the second-leading cause of death in the United 
States. Cancer Control Month provides the opportunity for Americans to 
learn vital information about cancer prevention, detection, and 
treatment.
Medical science is helping cancer victims live healthier, longer lives. 
Survival rates are rising, and today our country has more than 9 million 
cancer survivors. However, much work remains to be done. Researchers 
estimate that more than 1.3 million people in the United States will be 
diagnosed with cancer this year, and more than 800,000 will die from the 
disease.
A good diet, regular exercise, and healthy choices help people reduce 
their risk of developing many chronic diseases, including cancer. 
Research suggests that being overweight or obese accounts for 14 percent 
of cancer deaths among men and 20 percent among women.
Regular check-ups are also important in the fight against cancer. 
Preventive health screenings can detect many forms of cancer at earlier, 
less dangerous stages, allowing doctors to stop cancer before it 
spreads. I encourage all Americans to talk to their doctors about 
preventive screenings and regular check-ups.
As we observe Cancer Control Month, I commend cancer survivors for their 
courage and determination. I applaud medical professionals, researchers, 
family members, and friends for their efforts to improve the lives of 
those suffering from cancer and for their work in finding a cure for 
this devastating disease. I encourage all Americans to learn more about 
cancer. By working together, we can save lives and win the fight against 
cancer.
In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution (52 
Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103) as amended, requesting the President to issue 
an annual proclamation declaring April as ``Cancer Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 2004 as Cancer Control Month. I 
encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control 
cancer.

Proclamation 7766 of April 2, 2004

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America has a fundamental duty to protect the safety and well-being of 
its children. During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our 
commitment to preventing child abuse and neglect, and we dedicate 
ourselves to creating a safe environment in which our children can grow 
and thrive.
We have made important progress in protecting America's children, but 
too many still suffer from abuse and neglect. Recent reports indicate 
that nearly 900,000 children were found to be victims of abuse or 
neglect in 2002. Of these children, an estimated 1,400 died, 75 percent 
of whom were 4 years old or younger.
These young girls and boys depend on adults to recognize the risk 
factors and warning signs of abuse and to take action to end it. This 
critical responsibility is shared by parents, teachers, coaches, 
religious leaders, government officials, and concerned citizens in every 
community.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2004 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I encourage all citizens to take an active 
role in creating a caring community and help protect America's children 
from abuse and neglect.

Proclamation 7767 of April 2, 2004

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., we recognize the importance of 
teaching children good character and values. Families, schools, and 
religious congregations help instill in our children the enduring values 
of

[[Page 22]]

courage, compassion, integrity, and respect for differences of faith and 
race. By building the mind and character of every child in America, we 
encourage our children to make the right choices, and we create a future 
of promise and opportunity for all.
As we promote good character, we must also advance excellence in 
education and set high standards for all of our students. By raising 
expectations, insisting on results, and challenging failure, we 
strengthen our schools and create an environment where every student can 
succeed.
To help America's young people make the right choices, we need to 
provide them with good examples. Strong role models help children build 
confidence, gain knowledge, and develop good character. For the past 20 
years, this day has honored Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the 
Lubavitcher Rebbe. He helped establish education and outreach centers, 
offering social service programs and humanitarian aid worldwide. After 
his death in 1994, the Rebbe received the Congressional Gold Medal for 
his ``outstanding and lasting contributions toward improvements in world 
education, morality, and acts of charity.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2004, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to 
strengthen our Nation by teaching our children about the culture of 
responsibility and citizenship.

April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the

Proclamation 7768 of April 7, 2004

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) is one of the most widely 
recognized substance abuse and violence prevention programs in America. 
For more than 20 years, D.A.R.E. has brought specially trained police 
officers into classrooms to teach students about the importance of 
making healthy choices. These efforts have helped reduce illegal drug 
use in our country, but there remains work to be done.
Drug abuse costs people their health and robs them of their promise. A 
critical component of stopping illegal drug use is cutting the demand 
for drugs, and D.A.R.E. is an important part of expanding these efforts. 
By introducing students to local police officers and teaching them to 
become good citizens, D.A.R.E. also strengthens communities.
To help prevent illegal drug use, my National Drug Control Strategy 
includes the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign; support for drug-
free community coalitions; and $25 million for student drug testing. Our

[[Page 23]]

hard work is showing results. Youth drug use declined 11 percent between 
2001 and 2003, meaning that 400,000 fewer young people used drugs.
As we educate young people about the dangers of illegal drugs, we are 
also helping to heal those who have fallen into addiction and working to 
disrupt the market for illegal drugs. The collaborative efforts of 
concerned citizens and officials at the Federal, State, and local levels 
are making our neighborhoods safer and our children healthier.
We will continue to work toward a society in which all citizens are free 
from the devastating influence of drugs. Law enforcement officials, 
community leaders, faith-based groups, parents, teachers, and programs 
like D.A.R.E. are all working to achieve this goal.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 8, 2004, as National 
D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon our youth, parents, educators, and all 
Americans to join in the effort to reduce drug use by expressing 
appreciation for the health care professionals, law enforcement 
officials, volunteers, teachers, and all those who help young people 
avoid the dangers of illegal drugs and violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-

Proclamation 7769 of April 8, 2004

National Donate Life Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the first successful organ 
transplant in the United States. Since that time, organ and tissue 
transplantation have significantly increased, and last year, more than 
25,000 Americans received an organ transplant. National Donate Life 
Month provides the opportunity to raise awareness about organ and tissue 
donation and the importance of sharing your decision to donate with your 
family.
While medical advances are enabling Americans to receive lifesaving 
transplants, there are not enough donors to help everyone in need. Last 
year, close to 6,000 Americans died while waiting for organ transplants. 
Currently, more than 84,000 of our citizens are on the waiting list for 
a donation, and approximately 30,000 people will be diagnosed with 
diseases that a bone marrow transplant could cure.
My Administration is committed to increasing organ and tissue donation. 
I have included nearly $25 million in my 2005 budget proposal for organ 
procurement and transplantation efforts at the Department of Health and 
Human Services and nearly $23 million to support a bone marrow donor 
registry. In addition, we continue to increase donations through the 
``Gift

[[Page 24]]

of Life Donation Initiative.'' This campaign encourages businesses and 
organizations to make information on donation available to their 
employees, volunteers, and members, provides donor cards for individuals 
to carry with them, promotes the development of donor registries, and 
encourages States to educate teenagers on donation through their 
drivers' education classes. To make organ donation more viable, I 
recently signed into law the Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement 
Act. The Act authorizes the awarding of grants for travel reimbursement 
to potential donors and helps to increase public awareness and education 
about organ donation programs.
After a person decides to be a donor, one of the most important things 
he or she needs to do is talk with family members about this decision. 
Many opportunities are missed each year because families do not know 
what their loved ones wanted. During National Donate Life Month, we 
honor our Nation's organ and tissue donors and their families. Their 
decision to share the gift of life through America's donor programs 
serves as a positive example for all our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2004 as National 
Donate Life Month. I call upon our citizens to sign an organ and tissue 
donor card and to be screened for bone marrow donation. I also urge 
health care professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, 
and private organizations to help raise awareness of the important need 
for organ and tissue donors in communities throughout our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-

Proclamation 7770 of April 9, 2004

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans look to our veterans as examples of honor and patriotism. 
These loyal citizens have risked capture, imprisonment, and their lives 
to protect our homeland and advance freedom abroad. As we observe 
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we honor brave 
Americans who have demonstrated extraordinary courage in the face of 
hardship and terror.
Today, nine out of ten former prisoners of war are veterans of World War 
II. These Americans helped to liberate millions and defeat tyranny 
around the world, and survived unspeakable horrors for the cause of 
freedom. From enduring hard labor in German and Japanese POW camps to 
the torturous Bataan Death March, these proud patriots showed strength 
of character and incredible resolve in captivity. Their devotion to duty 
and love of country stand as a measure of service few others will 
attain.

[[Page 25]]

America will never forget these quiet heroes and all of our former 
prisoners of war who suffered adversity in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian 
Gulf, Somalia, Kosovo, Iraq, and other conflicts. Our Nation is grateful 
to our former prisoners of war for their sacrifice to help protect the 
democratic ideals that make our country strong. Because of the 
dedication of these men and women in uniform, people in our own country 
and in lands far away can live in freedom. These citizens inspire us, 
and we will always remember their service for liberty's blessings.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2004, as National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon all Americans to 
join me in remembering all former American prisoners of war who suffered 
the hardships of enemy captivity. I also call upon Federal, State, and 
local government officials and private organizations to observe this day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 7771 of April 13, 2004

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year on Pan American Day and during Pan American Week, we honor the 
bonds of friendship that unite the Pan American community. With the 
exception of one country, the nations of the Western Hemisphere 
recognize the importance of working together to strengthen democratic 
institutions, promote economic prosperity, invest in our people, and 
improve our security. At the recent 2004 Special Summit of the Americas, 
the 34 democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere reaffirmed their 
commitment to the Inter-American Democratic Charter to defend democracy 
and freedom whenever they are threatened. Our unity and support of 
democratic institutions, constitutional processes, and basic liberties 
give hope and strength to those struggling around the world.
The nations of the Western Hemisphere will continue to draw upon the 
Charter to strengthen the rule of law, protect human rights and 
freedoms, encourage economic growth, and promote good governance. As 
neighbors, we are expanding prosperity through open markets and economic 
reforms--creating new opportunities for millions of people and continued 
economic progress benefiting the nations of our hemisphere. My 
Administration will continue to work toward the creation of the Free 
Trade Area of the Americas, scheduled for completion in 2005.
To protect the rights and freedoms of all our citizens, the Pan American 
community must also combat the forces that threaten democracy: 
terrorism,

[[Page 26]]

drug trafficking, and other crimes that transcend national borders. The 
Declaration on Security in the Americas, adopted at the October 2003 
Organization of American States Special Conference on Security, 
underscores our hemisphere's interest in collectively maintaining peace 
and security across the Americas. The United States welcomes the 
opportunity to work with our neighbors to advance the Declaration's 
goals to safeguard our citizens as we build for a future that is 
peaceful, just, and prosperous.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2004, as Pan 
American Day and April 11 through April 17, 2004, as Pan American Week. 
I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the 
United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7772 of April 16, 2004

National Park Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our system of national parks is entrusted to each generation of 
Americans. By practicing good management and being faithful stewards of 
the land, our generation can show that we are worthy of that trust. 
During National Park Week, we renew our commitment to caring for these 
treasured natural resources.
God designed our lands to be beautiful, but we must ensure God's beauty 
is maintained and conserved. Our citizens depend on our dedicated 
National Park Service employees and their volunteer partners to fulfill 
this important mission. In 2001 and 2002, volunteers contributed 
millions of hours of service to our parks by clearing trails, repairing 
facilities, leading education programs, and assisting visitors. This 
year's National Park Week theme, ``Partners in Stewardship,'' encourages 
all Americans to join these volunteer partners in helping to look after 
our nearly 400 national park areas.
The Federal Government is investing more in its national parks now than 
at any time in its history. To help restore our national parks, my 
Administration proposed $4.9 billion in funding over 5 years on needed 
maintenance and repairs. We have undertaken hundreds of vital park 
maintenance projects and are planning and executing hundreds more. We 
are also using a new system of inventory and assessment to identify 
facilities needing improvements and to measure those improvements as 
they are implemented.

[[Page 27]]

Our citizens own America's parks, historic sites, battlefields, 
recreation areas, monuments, and shores, and we want these lands to be 
accessible and enjoyable for them to visit. We must respect our natural, 
cultural, and recreational heritage and conserve our parks for future 
generations. Park maintenance is critical to achieving each of these 
goals. By modernizing trail systems, we make it possible for people to 
fully appreciate these remarkable places. By maintaining buildings, 
roads, and campsites, we ensure our parks remain sources of pride for 
our citizens, our communities, and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 25, 
2004, as National Park Week. I call upon the people of the United States 
to join me in recognizing the importance of our national parks and to 
learn more about these areas of beauty, their cultural and historical 
significance, and the many ways citizens can volunteer to conserve these 
precious resources.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7773 of April 16, 2004

National Volunteer Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The strength of America lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens. 
Across our country, citizens are donating their time and talents to 
improving lives and strengthening communities. During National Volunteer 
Week, we recognize and celebrate those who serve a cause greater than 
self.
This year's theme, ``Volunteers Inspire by Example,'' highlights the 
role of volunteers in encouraging others to serve. Last year, more than 
63 million Americans gave their time to helping in their communities, an 
increase of 4 million from the prior year. Through the dedicated efforts 
of America's volunteers, we are building a culture of service, 
responsibility, and compassion, particularly among our young people.
Volunteers can make a difference in many ways--by mentoring a child, 
caring for the ailing and elderly, building a playground, or caring for 
the environment. I created the USA Freedom Corps to help Americans find 
opportunities to volunteer. As I travel around our country, I am honored 
to meet citizens of all ages who volunteer through programs such as the 
Citizen Corps, AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and the Peace Corps, as well as 
many other organizations. Their acts of kindness have a profound effect 
on people's lives and on the future of our country. To recognize those 
who have demonstrated a sustained commitment to volunteer service, my 
Council on Service and Civic Participation presents individuals, 
families, and groups

[[Page 28]]

with the President's Volunteer Service Award. This award is a tribute to 
those whose outstanding efforts are helping make our country a better 
place.
America's volunteers set a fine example for our Nation, and I encourage 
all Americans to look for a challenge in their communities and step 
forward to lend a hand.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 24, 
2004, as National Volunteer Week. I call on all Americans to recognize 
and celebrate the important work that volunteers do every day across our 
country. I also encourage those who have not yet answered the call to 
explore ways to get involved.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7774 of April 17, 2004

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We have made significant advances in reducing crime in our communities. 
As we continue to work to prevent crime, we also have a duty to help 
victims as they cope with the trauma of crimes committed against them. 
Each year during National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we acknowledge the 
suffering endured by crime victims, and we honor those who bring hope 
and comfort to victims and their families.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Victims of 
Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA), landmark legislation that sustains thousands 
of local victim assistance programs across the country. Established by 
VOCA, the Crime Victims Fund provides crucial assistance for victims and 
their families, including counseling, shelter, courtroom advocacy, and 
help with expenses. In recent years, VOCA has begun addressing issues 
such as cybercrime, identity theft, hate violence, and stalking. It has 
also expanded its services to help victims of domestic and international 
terrorism.
While our Nation works to prevent terrorist activities, we also continue 
to wage a war against other crimes. In fighting violent crime, we battle 
the problems of drug abuse, gun violence, and other threats to our 
safety. We must ensure that when crimes do occur, we always protect the 
rights of victims. For this reason, my Administration continues to 
endorse the bipartisan Crime Victims' Rights Amendment. By allowing 
victims of violent crime to be present and heard at public proceedings 
and by giving them access to information, such an amendment would 
guarantee victims' inclusion in the criminal justice process without 
threatening the rights of defendants.

[[Page 29]]

While the Congress considers this amendment, my Administration continues 
to support important resources for victims and public safety. We have 
directed funding to improve the use of DNA technology to solve crime and 
identify missing persons; we are employing multiple agency resources to 
aid victims of trafficking who are forced into slavery and prostitution; 
and we are encouraging faith-based organizations to provide spiritual 
and material sustenance to those who have suffered and lost.
This month, I was pleased to sign into law the Unborn Victims of 
Violence Act of 2004, which creates a separate offense under Federal law 
for death or injury to an unborn child, in addition to any charges 
relating to the mother. Across our country, victims are being better 
served and better protected, but more can be done. I encourage every 
community to show compassion to victims and their families by providing 
them with the support they need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 24, 
2004, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I encourage all Americans 
to embrace the cause of victims' rights and help to advance it 
throughout our society.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7775 of April 23, 2004

Jewish Heritage Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Jewish Heritage Week commemorates the rich history of the Jewish people 
and the many contributions Jewish Americans have made to our Nation. 
This year marks the 350th anniversary of the first permanent Jewish 
settlement in North America, in what is known today as New York. We 
honor the courage and perseverance of these Jewish immigrants and their 
descendants, and we celebrate their steadfast dedication to the ideals 
that make America strong.
Through their stories of tragedy and survival, the Jewish people 
demonstrate their unyielding faith and share with us the important truth 
that even in the face of terrible tragedy, hope endures. Many Jews came 
to America in search of a land of freedom and opportunity, and we must 
work to preserve their stories for future generations. The lessons of 
these stories are timeless and help guide us through the challenges 
ahead.
Over the past three and a half centuries, Jewish Americans have helped 
shape the history and culture of our Nation. As scientists, physicians, 
social workers, educators, artists, businessmen, and in many other 
professions, Jewish citizens have contributed to the strength of our 
country. Their

[[Page 30]]

commitment to religious freedom, respect for diversity, and belief in 
democracy have enriched our society and helped make America a better 
place for all. During this historic time, we are particularly grateful 
for the many Jewish Americans who serve in our military. Their efforts 
help advance the cause of freedom and provide hope for people around the 
world.
As we observe Jewish Heritage Week, we remember the proud legacy and 
determination of the Jewish people and their strong dedication to faith, 
family, and service.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 25 through May 2, 
2004, as Jewish Heritage Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
week with appropriate programs and activities that highlight and honor 
the contributions Jewish Americans have made to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7776 of April 30, 2004

Older Americans Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 47 million Americans are 60 years old or older. During Older 
Americans Month, we honor our senior citizens for enriching and 
strengthening our Nation, and we pledge to continue working to enhance 
their quality of life.
This year's theme, ``Aging Well, Living Well,'' reflects the many ways 
that older Americans contribute to our national character. Many are 
working beyond traditional retirement age, while others volunteer their 
time serving worthy causes. Through the Senior Corps program of the USA 
Freedom Corps, more than half a million older Americans donated time to 
their communities last year, and many others are volunteering through 
the Peace Corps and other programs.
My Administration is committed to helping our senior citizens lead 
better, healthier, and longer lives. Late last year, I was proud to sign 
into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization 
Act of 2003. This historic legislation represents the greatest 
improvement in senior health care since President Lyndon Johnson signed 
the Social Security Act Amendments that created Medicare in 1965. It 
gives seniors access to affordable prescription drug coverage, provides 
for preventive screenings to diagnose and treat health conditions early, 
and updates the Medicare system to let seniors choose coverage that best 
meets their needs. These changes are vital to ensuring that seniors can 
obtain the health care and prescription drugs they deserve.

[[Page 31]]

Older Americans help others to understand the past, and they teach 
timeless lessons of courage, endurance, and love. Through their legacy 
of patriotism, service, and responsibility, America's seniors also unite 
families and communities and serve as role models for younger 
generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2004 as Older 
Americans Month. I commend older Americans for the contributions they 
make to our communities. I further commend Federal officials, State, and 
local governments, tribal organizations, service and health care 
providers, caregivers, volunteers, and all those who work on behalf of 
our senior citizens. I encourage all Americans to honor their elders and 
publicly reaffirm our Nation's commitment to older Americans during this 
month and throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7777 of April 30, 2004

National Charter Schools Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America looks to its schools to give all students the skills they need 
to realize their dreams and reach their potential. Charter schools help 
fulfill this mission. During National Charter Schools Week, we celebrate 
the successes of these institutions.
Charter schools are an important part of our effort to improve the 
public school system and offer broader educational options to every 
family. Like other public schools, charter schools are open to all 
students. Because they are subject to fewer State and district 
regulations than other public schools, charter schools offer teachers 
and administrators more freedom in tailoring programs to meet specific 
student and community needs. In exchange for this freedom, they must 
meet stricter accountability standards.
Now in their second decade, the demand for charter schools is growing 
among families from all backgrounds. During this school year, our 
Nation's charter schools will educate nearly 700,000 students. Many 
families choose charter schools because of the innovative curriculum and 
focus on academic achievement, and because these schools can be a 
promising alternative to a low-performing neighborhood school.
Charter schools are an important part of the No Child Left Behind Act. 
They provide parents with more choices for their children's education. 
The greater autonomy of charter schools allows them to employ innovative 
educational practices. Studies have shown that many charter schools 
improve academic achievement for their students and that parents of 
students in charter schools are satisfied with their children's schools.

[[Page 32]]

My fiscal year 2005 budget includes an overall 49 percent increase for 
elementary and secondary education over 2001 levels, and it proposes 
$219 million for charter school grants and $100 million for charter 
school facilities. Together, funding for these two charter school 
programs has increased 68 percent over 2001 levels. By raising 
expectations, insisting on results, and refusing to accept failure, we 
are strengthening our public schools and improving education for all 
children in America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2 through May 8, 2004, 
as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's charter 
schools, and I call on parents of charter school students to share their 
successes to help all Americans understand more about the important work 
of charter schools.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the

Proclamation 7778 of April 30, 2004

Law Day, U.S.A., 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The theme of this year's Law Day, ``To Win Equality by Law: Brown v. 
Board at 50,'' celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's 
landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
The Declaration of Independence declared the equality of each person 
before God and the responsibility of Government to secure the rights of 
all. However, it was not until ratification of the 14th Amendment in 
1868 that the equality of all citizens under law was guaranteed by the 
Constitution. Still, for decades afterwards, millions of African-
American citizens were subjected to shameful discrimination, and in many 
public school systems, students were segregated by race. Finally, in the 
1954 Brown decision, the Supreme Court ruled that segregating students 
in our public schools violated our Constitution.
Our Nation is grateful for the brave men and women and boys and girls 
who challenged segregation and helped make equal justice under law a 
reality for all Americans. We remember Thurgood Marshall, the heroic 
lawyer who represented Linda Brown and fought for her rights and the 
rights of all African Americans. We remember the nine justices of the 
Supreme Court of the United States who helped America begin to make 
equal justice under law a reality for African Americans.
Nearly 50 years after Brown, we appreciate the progress America has 
made, but we also recognize that there is still work to be done to 
ensure that our country lives up to the founding principle that all of 
God's children are

[[Page 33]]

created equal. As we observe this Law Day and commemorate the 
anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, I encourage all Americans to 
celebrate the great distance we have traveled as a Nation and to 
continue our work to promote equality and opportunity for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2004, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all the people of 
the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. I also call upon Government officials to display the flag of 
the United States in support of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of

Proclamation 7779 of April 30, 2004

Loyalty Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, we work to preserve the freedom declared by our Founding 
Fathers, defended by generations, and granted to every man and woman on 
Earth by the Almighty. On Loyalty Day, we are reminded that we are 
citizens with obligations to our country, to each other, and to our 
great legacy of freedom and democracy.
We learn lessons of loyalty from the selfless dedication and unwavering 
allegiance of our men and women in uniform. We are grateful for their 
courage and willingness to sacrifice for our country, and we stand 
united behind them. Through the ``On the Homefront'' program, a USA 
Freedom Corps initiative, many Americans are writing to service members, 
contributing to the purchase of care packages to be sent overseas, and 
helping the families of those deployed with basic family needs such as 
home repairs, financial planning, and child care. By supporting our 
troops and their families, citizens are making a difference in their 
communities and showing loyalty to our country through their patriotism.
America's citizens are also demonstrating their loyalty to our Nation 
through volunteer service. In answering the call to serve something 
greater than self, Americans reflect the compassion and decency that 
make our country great. Through the USA Freedom Corps, my Administration 
is providing information about volunteer opportunities to Americans so 
they can give back to their communities and help their fellow citizens 
in need. The hard work and generosity of America's volunteers help build 
a culture of service and responsible citizenship that strengthens 
America and sets a positive example for future generations.
Over the past few years, America has once again witnessed the loyalty 
and character of our citizens. We must continue to ensure that our young 
people know the great cause of freedom and why it is worth defending. 
Our

[[Page 34]]

Founders believed the study of history and citizenship should be at the 
core of every American's education. By encouraging students to learn 
more about American history and values, we can help prepare the next 
generation of Americans to carry our heritage of freedom into the 
future. To further this goal, my Administration has created initiatives 
such as ``We the People'' and ``Our Documents'' to help bring the 
stories and documents central to our history into the modern classroom.
Loyalty Day encourages citizens to demonstrate their commitment to our 
country by supporting our military, serving each other, and teaching our 
young people about our history and values. Being an American is a 
privilege, and our patriotism is a living faith in our country's 
founding ideals and the promise of the American Dream.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated May 1 of 
each year as ``Loyalty Day,'' and I ask all Americans to join me in this 
day of celebration and in reaffirming our allegiance to our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2004, as Loyalty Day. I call upon all 
the people of the United States to join in support of this national 
observance. I also call upon government officials to display the flag of 
the United States on all government buildings on Loyalty Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the

Proclamation 7780 of April 30, 2004

National Day of Prayer, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In his first Inaugural Address, President George Washington prayed that 
the Almighty would preserve the freedom of all Americans. On the 
National Day of Prayer, we celebrate that freedom and America's great 
tradition of prayer. The National Day of Prayer encourages Americans of 
every faith to give thanks for God's many blessings and to pray for each 
other and our Nation.
Prayer is an opportunity to praise God for His mighty works, His gift of 
freedom, His mercy, and His boundless love. Through prayer, we recognize 
the limits of earthly power and acknowledge the sovereignty of God. 
According to Scripture, ``the Lord is near to all who call upon Him . . 
. He also will hear their cry, and save them.'' Prayer leads to humility 
and a grateful heart, and it turns our minds to the needs of others.
On this National Day of Prayer, we pray especially for the brave men and 
women of the United States Armed Forces who are serving around the world 
to defend the cause of liberty. We are grateful for their courage and 
sacrifice and ask God to comfort their families while they are away from

[[Page 35]]

home. We also pray that the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, and 
throughout the Greater Middle East, may live in safety and freedom. 
During this time, we continue to ask God's blessing for our Nation, 
granting us strength to meet the challenges ahead and wisdom as we work 
to build a more peaceful future for all.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on our 
citizens to reaffirm the role of prayer in our society by recognizing 
annually a ``National Day of Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 6, 2004, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
ask the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, each according to his or 
her own faith, for the freedoms and blessings we have received and for 
God's continued guidance and protection. I also urge all Americans to 
join in observing this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.

Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, we honor the 
accomplishments of Asian/Pacific Americans and the many ways they have 
enriched our society and shaped the character of our Nation through 
their diverse languages, cultures, and religious beliefs.
Today, Asian/Pacific Americans are leaders in public service, business, 
government, science, law, education, athletics, the arts, and many other 
areas. Their love of family, community, and hard work has helped to 
uphold our Nation for many generations. Asian/Pacific American 
entrepreneurs are helping to strengthen our economy and our communities 
through their hard work and ingenuity, and they inspire a new generation 
of American innovation through their example.
Throughout our history, Asian/Pacific Americans have been patriots, 
answering the call to defend our Nation and to protect the blessings of 
liberty and democracy. Today, in the war on terror, Asian/Pacific 
Americans serve proudly as they carry on our Nation's noble tradition of 
advancing the cause of freedom around the world. We are grateful for the 
sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and those who love and support 
them as we fight to protect our homeland and make the world safe for 
democracy.
Today, the more than 13 million Americans of Asian or Pacific Island 
heritage contribute to the vitality, success, and prosperity of our 
Nation. To honor the achievements and contributions of Asian/Pacific 
Americans, the

[[Page 36]]

Congress by Public Law 102-450 as amended, has designated the month of 
May each year as ``Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

Month. I call upon the people of the United States to reflect upon the 
history of Asian/Pacific Americans and their many contributions to our 
Nation.

Proclamation 7782 of May 7, 2004

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Physical fitness is an integral part of a healthy life and a healthy 
America. National Physical Fitness and Sports Month provides an 
opportunity for all Americans to learn more about the benefits of 
exercise and sports and to make being physically active part of their 
everyday lives.
Regular physical activity builds strength and aerobic fitness, provides 
motivation, promotes relaxation, and facilitates sleep for people of all 
ages and abilities. Regular exercise--in some cases, simply walking for 
half an hour--can help reduce the risk of many serious health problems, 
such as heart disease and diabetes. By participating in sports, 
individuals also learn teamwork, discipline, and how to accept victory 
and defeat with grace. These important lessons help build good character 
and teach strong values.
My Administration has recommended a few simple steps to achieve better 
health and fitness. Our HealthierUS Initiative promotes daily physical 
activity, healthy diets, and preventative screenings. It also encourages 
people to avoid tobacco and drugs, and to make responsible choices about 
alcohol. Across our country, people are making physical activity part of 
their daily lives by participating in the President's Challenge, a 
fitness program that helps them track weekly fitness activities and 
rewards them for reaching defined fitness goals.
As we observe National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, I urge adults 
and children to participate in regular physical activity. I encourage 
parents to make family time active, and I call on Americans to help 
motivate their friends to have anactive lifestyle. By exercising 
regularly and participating in sports, we can improve our health, set a 
positive example for our children, and help build a stronger future for 
our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2004 as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States

[[Page 37]]

to recognize the importance of daily physical activity and sports for 
all our citizens, and to make fitness a part of daily life. I also call 
on all Americans to celebrate this month with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs.

Proclamation 7783 of May 7, 2004

Mother's Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

President Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``The mother is the one supreme 
asset of national life; she is more important by far than the successful 
statesman, or business man, or artist, or scientist.'' Today, mothers 
continue to be an important part of our national character. On Mother's 
Day, we honor the women whose steadfast love and wisdom have made 
America a better place.
During the Civil War, Julia Ward Howe, author of ``The Battle Hymn of 
the Republic,'' proposed renaming July 4 as Mother's Day and a day 
dedicated to peace. Anna Reeves Jarvis also began working for a similar 
holiday and sponsored a Mother's Friendship Day in her hometown to 
reunite families divided by the war. It was not until 2 years after her 
mother's death that her daughter, Anna M. Jarvis, started the campaign 
for the observance of Mother's Day in the United States. By 1911, 
Mother's Day was observed in nearly every State of the Union, and in 
1914, responding to a joint resolution of the Congress, President 
Woodrow Wilson officially designated Mother's Day a national observance.
Motherhood is a rewarding and often difficult job. A mother is a child's 
first teacher and affects a child's life like few others can. Effective 
mothers can inspire their sons and daughters to love themselves and 
others, work hard, make healthy choices, serve causes greater than self, 
and achieve their dreams. Mothers who protect, teach, and nurture their 
children with all their hearts strengthen their families and help build 
a better future for our country.
This Mother's Day, we express our heartfelt thanks to our mothers for 
their unconditional love and guidance. We take time to recognize the 
many mothers who are supporting their brave sons and daughters in the 
Armed Forces, and the many others who are themselves serving proudly in 
defense of America's freedom and security. The service and sacrifice of 
these women reflect the best of our Nation. They and their loved ones 
are in our thoughts and prayers.

The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914, as amended (38 
Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as 
``Mother's Day'' and has requested the President to call for its 
appropriate observance. In honor of all of our Nation's mothers, I am 
pleased to do so.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 9, 2004, as Mother's Day. I commend 
mothers for the important contributions they make to our society and 
encourage all Americans to express their love, gratitude, and respect 
for mothers, and to honor their mothers on this day and throughout the 
year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7784 of May 7, 2004

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Law enforcement officers are among America's greatest heroes. Every day, 
these men and women protect our families, homes, businesses, and 
communities.
Our dedicated peace officers put themselves at great risk while working 
tirelessly on the front lines in the fight against crime, violence, and 
terrorism. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial 
Fund, last year, 145 law enforcement officers made the ultimate 
sacrifice and gave their lives in the line of duty, while thousands of 
others were injured protecting our citizens from harm. On Peace Officers 
Memorial Day and throughout Police Week, we honor the memory of the 
fallen and recognize those who devote their lives to enforcing our laws, 
bringing criminals to justice, and making America safer and better.
Over the past year, many in our law enforcement community have been 
activated as Reservists or members of the National Guard. We are 
grateful to these officers and all our military personnel for answering 
the call to service, for their commitment to duty, and for the 
sacrifices they are making in defense of freedom.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended, (76 Stat. 
676), the Congress has authorized and requested the President to 
designate May 15 of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the 
week in which it falls as ``Police Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2004, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 9 through May 15, 2004, as Police Week. I call on all Americans 
to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 7785 of May 14, 2004

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, America's transportation system helps many travelers reach 
their destinations and carries more than 16 billion tons of freight 
worth almost $12 trillion. In addition, our transportation systems play 
a critical role in deploying and sustaining our troops and their 
equipment around the world.
Throughout our history, advances in transportation have been at the 
forefront of progress. Last December, we celebrated the centennial of 
the Wright Brothers' first flight in North Carolina. The pioneering work 
of the Wright Brothers and subsequent improvements in aviation ushered 
in new eras of freedom and captured the imaginations of people around 
the world.
Today, our Nation proudly continues this tradition of innovation in all 
transportation fields. As we observe National Defense Transportation Day 
and National Transportation Week, we continue to modernize 
transportation, and we honor transportation professionals who help to 
keep our transportation systems secure, efficient, and reliable.
To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry 
and who contribute to our Nation's well-being and defense, the Congress, 
by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), 
has designated the third Friday in May of each year as ``National 
Defense Transportation Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 
1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), declared that the week during which 
that Friday falls be designated as ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 21, 2004, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 16 through May 22, 2004, as National 
Transportation Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7786 of May 14, 2004

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Hurricanes are among nature's most powerful forces, bringing destructive 
winds, tornadoes, and floods from torrential rains and ocean storm 
surges. Each year, several hurricanes develop off American shores in the 
Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico. Some of these strike 
the United States coastline every year, causing numerous fatalities and 
costing billions of dollars in damage. Many Americans are vulnerable to 
the dangers of these storms.
In recent years, advances in how we predict and track these storms have 
improved preparedness and saved lives, but people living in hurricane-
prone areas still must be prepared. The National Hurricane Center within 
the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) recommends developing a family disaster plan, 
creating a disaster supply kit, and staying aware of current weather 
situations.
While citizens make preparations to keep themselves safe, the Federal 
Government is maintaining our commitment to improve forecasts to provide 
advance warning and to coordinate effective emergency response. The 
Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency is 
also working on a plan to better position disaster equipment and 
supplies, so Federal resources to support local emergency services 
arrive quickly.
While no policy can eliminate the threat that hurricanes pose to lives 
and property, cooperation among citizens and Federal, State, and local 
officials can reduce the dangers and provide a more effective response 
to these storms.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 
2004, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government 
agencies, private organizations, schools, news media, and residents in 
hurricane-prone areas to share information about hurricane preparedness 
and response, and to implement steps to minimize storm damage and save 
lives. I also call upon Americans living in the coastal areas of our 
Nation to use this opportunity to learn more about how to protect 
themselves against the effects of hurricanes and tropical storms.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7787 of May 14, 2004

Small Business Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The dedication and entrepreneurial spirit of small business owners are 
vital to our Nation's economic growth and prosperity. We celebrate Small 
Business Week to applaud the efforts of America's small business men and 
women in our communities.
Small businesses are a central part of America's economy. They create 
approximately 70 percent of new private sector jobs in this country. As 
our Nation's economy continues to grow stronger, we must encourage their 
spirit of enterprise.
To help small businesses invest and create more jobs, we have decreased 
the tax burden. We have given small business men and women a fair chance 
to bid on government contracts. We have a plan to create more 
opportunity for America's small businesses and workers by making health 
care costs more affordable and predictable; streamlining regulations and 
paperwork requirements; reducing frivolous lawsuits; making America less 
dependent on foreign sources of energy; and permanently eliminating the 
death tax.
In this Small Business Week, we salute America's small business owners 
and entrepreneurs and workers for their contributions to America's 
prosperity and for making our Nation better and stronger.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 
2004, as Small Business Week. I call upon all the people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs that celebrate the achievements of small business owners and 
their employees and encourage and foster the development of new small 
businesses.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of

Proclamation 7788 of May 14, 2004

World Trade Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Participating in the world economy makes America's economy stronger. By 
opening new markets for American products and services, bringing lower

[[Page 42]]

prices and more choices to American consumers, and attracting foreign 
companies to invest and hire in the United States, free and fair trade 
helps create better jobs for American workers. During World Trade Week, 
we celebrate the benefits trade brings to our citizens, our economy, and 
to countries and people around the world.
Since World War II, the United States has led the world in advancing 
trade to create jobs for American workers, increase choice for 
consumers, and ensure that quality American goods and services are sold 
on every continent. Today, millions of American jobs depend on our goods 
and services being sold overseas, and foreign-owned companies and their 
suppliers employ millions of Americans here at home.
My Administration has aggressively negotiated trade agreements that 
slash foreign tariffs and remove the barriers to selling American goods 
and services around the world. Since 2001, we have entered into free 
trade agreements with Chile and Singapore and concluded negotiations 
with Australia, Morocco, the Dominican Republic, and five countries in 
Central America. Free trade agreement negotiations with Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru, Panama, Bahrain, Thailand, and five member countries of 
the Southern African Customs Union are in progress or about to begin. We 
are also working with our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere to create 
a Free Trade Area of the Americas that will form the world's largest 
common market and improve the lives of citizens in America and these 
countries. By opening foreign markets to American exports and 
encouraging foreign countries to set up operations in the United States, 
all of these agreements help create more and better jobs in our Nation. 
They also help increase prosperity for our workers.
For American businesses and their employees to continue to outperform 
other countries, America must remain the best place to do business and 
invest capital. In addition, we must ensure that our citizens are 
prepared for the high-skilled jobs our economy is creating. By fostering 
an environment where the entrepreneurial spirit flourishes and by 
providing workers with the best skills and education in the world, we 
can maintain our country's economic leadership and help all our citizens 
achieve a better life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 
2004, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate 
the benefits of trade to our Nation and the global economy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7789 of May 21, 2004

National Maritime Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Maritime Day provides an opportunity to recognize the men and 
women of the United States Merchant Marine and their contributions to 
our national security and economic strength.
Since they first offered their ships and services to assist the 
Continental Navy in our struggle for independence, to their 
distinguished service in World War II, merchant mariners have 
courageously sacrificed to protect our country and defend our freedoms. 
In 1936, America recognized the contributions of these patriots and 
established the U.S. Merchant Marine ``as a naval or military auxiliary 
in time of war or national emergency.'' Today, merchant mariners are 
delivering essential supplies and equipment to our troops in Iraq and 
bravely serving the cause of liberty. They continue to play an important 
role in our Nation's efforts to advance democracy, peace, and freedom 
around the world, and we are grateful for their dedication.
Merchant mariners also contribute significantly to the U.S. maritime 
transportation system. More than 95 percent of non-North American trade 
enters our country through our seaports. These ports handle more than 
$740 billion and 2 billion tons of domestic and international freight 
each year. Those in the maritime industry, including merchant mariners, 
enhance waterborne commerce and help promote America's economic growth.
Today, we honor the courage, determination, and service of our Nation's 
merchant mariners and remember the many who have given their lives in 
defense of our country. Their work reflects the patriotism and devotion 
to duty that make America great.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 20, 1933, as amended, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day,'' and has 
authorized and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2004, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon the people of the United States to celebrate this observance 
and to display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their 
communities. I also request that all ships sailing under the American 
flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7790 of May 21, 2004

National Safe Boating Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's many waterways give millions of boating enthusiasts the 
opportunity to enjoy the outdoors and spend time with family and 
friends. With nearly 13 million recreational boats on our oceans, lakes, 
and rivers, boating is a popular pastime. However, far too many 
Americans are hurt or killed each year in boating accidents that are 
largely preventable.
Each year, of the thousands of boating accidents that occur, many are 
caused by operators who are careless, reckless, or inexperienced. In 
most cases, boat operators had received no safety instruction, and many 
of those who died could have been saved if they had worn life jackets. 
During National Safe Boating week, we seek to raise awareness to improve 
safety and reduce accidents on our Nation's waters.
Across the Nation, many groups are working to teach recreational boaters 
how they can make boating safer through the 2004 North American Safe 
Boating Campaign. These include the U.S. Coast Guard, the Coast Guard 
Auxiliary, the National Safe Boating Council, and the National 
Association of State Boating Law Administrators. These groups recommend 
that boaters get boat safety checks, ensure that boats are properly 
maintained, take safe boating classes, be aware of homeland security 
issues, always wear a life jacket, and never operate a boat under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs. By learning about boating safety and 
taking some simple precautions, recreational boaters can reduce the risk 
of accidents and ensure that they enjoy their time on the water 
responsibly.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe 
Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22 through May 28, 2004, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage the Governors of the 50 States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, to join in observing this occasion. I 
also urge all boaters to learn more about safe boating practices, always 
wear life jackets, and take advantage of boating safety programs 
throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7791 of May 26, 2004

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than two centuries, Americans have been called to defend the 
founding ideals of our democracy. On Memorial Day, a grateful Nation 
remembers the proud patriots who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense 
of liberty's blessings.
From the opening battles of the American Revolution through the turmoil 
of the Civil War, to World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, to 
the Persian Gulf and today's operations in the war on terror in 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the world, the members of our military 
have built a tradition of honorable and faithful service. As we observe 
Memorial Day, we remember the more than one million Americans who have 
died to preserve our freedom, the more than 140,000 citizens who were 
prisoners of war, and all those who were declared missing in action. We 
also honor our veterans for their dedication to America and their 
sacrifice.
This year, we honor many heroes by observing the 60th anniversary of D-
Day on the beaches of Normandy, and by dedicating the National World War 
II Memorial in Washington, D.C. In a radio address on June 6, 1944, 
President Franklin Roosevelt described these service members as the 
``pride of our Nation,'' who struggled to preserve our civilization. The 
fallen from that fateful day and that war will always be remembered. 
They hold a cherished place in the history of the United States and in 
the memories of the people they liberated.
Today, all who wear the uniform of the United States are serving at a 
crucial hour in history, and each has answered a great call to serve our 
Nation on the front lines of freedom. As we continue to fight terrorism 
and promote peace and freedom, let us pray for the safety and strength 
of our troops, for God's blessing on them and their families, and for 
those who have lost loved ones.
On this Memorial Day, we honor all of our fallen soldiers, their 
commitment to our country, and their legacy of patriotism and sacrifice. 
By giving their lives in the cause of freedom, these heroes have 
protected and inspired all Americans.
In respect for their devotion to America, the Congress, by a joint 
resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (64 Stat. 158), has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of 
the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for 
permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 
106-579, has also designated the minute beginning at 3:00 p.m. local 
time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe the National 
Moment of Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 31, 2004, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all

[[Page 46]]

Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 
3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I urge the press, radio, 
television, and all other media to participate in these observances.
I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of 
government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on 
this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels 
throughout the United States, and in all areas under its jurisdiction 
and control. I also request the people of the United States to display 
the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon 
period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

D-Day National Remembrance Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty years ago, the soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the Allied 
Expeditionary Force invaded Normandy in northern France to open a new 
front in our war against Nazism and tyranny. The courage of these troops 
turned the tide of World War II and changed the fate of the world 
forever. Their extraordinary service in the face of great danger 
demonstrated the finest qualities of our Nation and of our Allies, and 
millions around the world today live in freedom because of their 
sacrifice. By remembering the heroic actions of our Armed Forces at 
Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword beaches in 1944, we honor a 
generation who served this country and saved liberty for people 
everywhere.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 6, 2004, as D-Day National Remembrance 
Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this occasion with appropriate 
activities, ceremonies and programs designed to honor those who served 
and sacrificed to liberate Europe and defend America's freedom and 
security.

Proclamation 7793 of June 5, 2004

National Child's Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Children are a precious gift and a source of great hope for our future. 
National Child's Day celebrates children and reminds us of the 
importance of nurturing a child's personal development and providing a 
safe environment in which to grow.
Children need our guidance and support. During this time in America's 
history, teaching our children to love our Nation and its values remains 
a critical responsibility. We need to help young people understand that 
freedom is God's gift to every man and woman and that America's legacy 
is one of ensuring liberty for all. Our children also need to know about 
what other generations have done to build and preserve this great 
country, including the service and sacrifice of the men and women who 
have defended our Nation. To help prepare our next generation of leaders 
to carry on America's tradition of freedom, my Administration has 
launched the ``We the People'' initiative to improve the teaching of 
history and civics in America's schools, along with the ``Our 
Documents'' initiative to help make the treasures in our Nation's 
archives more accessible to students and teachers.
Building a solid foundation of character education for our young people 
helps to keep our country strong. We live by the immutable values that 
families, schools, and religious congregations instill in us. To assist 
these fundamental institutions as they shape generations of Americans, 
my Administration is supporting Partnerships in Character Education, 
which helps establish educational programs that focus on caring, civic 
virtue, citizenship, justice, fairness, respect, responsibility, and 
trustworthiness. It is essential to teach these morals with confidence 
and conviction, as they will guide America's children through their 
lives.
Government cannot replace the love of a family in a child's life, but it 
can help create an environment where children can grow into healthy, 
responsible adults. My Administration has taken several steps to 
strengthen education and promote the safety and well-being of America's 
children. I signed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 to transform 
education and open the door of opportunity to all of our children. We 
have also strengthened laws to protect children from criminals and 
expanded the AMBER Alert system to help recover abducted children. And 
because the decisions young people make now can affect their health and 
character for the rest of their lives, my Administration is working to 
send positive messages to children to help them make healthy lifestyle 
choices, avoid the dangers of drug use, and to develop healthy eating 
and exercise habits early in life.
On National Child's Day, we recognize the importance of working together 
to create a society that is safe for our children, and we renew our 
commitment to helping families build a bright future for young people 
and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 48]]

laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 6, 2004, as National 
Child's Day. I urge all Americans to set a positive example for children 
and to work to ensure that their communities are safe and supportive 
places that help young people grow and reach their full potential. I 
also call upon citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7794 of June 6, 2004

Announcing the Death of Ronald Reagan

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:

It is my sad duty to announce officially the death of Ronald Reagan, the 
fortieth President of the United States, on June 5, 2004.
We are blessed to live in a Nation, and a world, that have been shaped 
by the will, the leadership, and the vision of Ronald Reagan.
With an unshakable faith in the values of our country and the character 
of our people, Ronald Reagan renewed America's confidence and restored 
our Nation. His optimism, strength, and humility epitomized the American 
spirit. He always told us that for America the best was yet to come.
Ronald Reagan believed that God takes the side of justice and that 
America has a special calling to oppose tyranny and defend freedom. 
Through his courage and determination, he enhanced America's security 
and advanced the spread of peace, liberty, and democracy to millions of 
people who had lived in darkness and oppression. As America's President, 
Ronald Reagan helped change the world.
President Reagan has left us, but he has left us stronger and better. We 
take comfort in the knowledge that he has left us for a better place, 
the shining city that awaits him.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, in honor and tribute to the memory of Ronald Reagan, 
and as an expression of public sorrow, do hereby direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed at half-staff at the White House and on 
all buildings, grounds, and Naval vessels of the United States for a 
period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that for the 
same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign 
countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at 
half-staff over their Embassies, Legations, and other facilities abroad, 
including all military facilities and stations.

[[Page 49]]

I hereby order that suitable honors be rendered by units of the Armed 
Forces under orders of the Secretary of Defense.
I do further appoint Friday, June 11, 2004, as a National Day of 
Mourning throughout the United States. I call on the American people to 
assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay 
homage to the memory of President Reagan. I invite the people of the 
world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of June,

Proclamation 7795 of June 4, 2004

Great Outdoors Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 200 years ago, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark 
embarked upon an expedition to explore uncharted lands and find passage 
across the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. During the Captains' 
journey, their Corps of Discovery encountered remarkable landscapes, 
observed wildlife, and traded with American Indians. Two years into his 
experience, Captain Lewis was inspired by the beauty of a waterfall 
along the Missouri River that he called in his journal, ``the grandest 
sight I ever beheld.'' Today, the splendor of the great outdoors 
continues to inspire our citizens, and a love of outdoor recreation 
remains a fundamental part of the American character. By observing Great 
Outdoors Month, we celebrate our commitment to appreciating and 
protecting our natural wealth.
Outdoor recreation is an ideal way to exercise and enjoy memorable 
experiences with family and friends, and all across our country are 
scenic places that sports and nature enthusiasts can explore and help 
keep beautiful. During Great Outdoors Month and throughout the year, I 
encourage Americans to go camping, fishing, hunting, hiking, bird 
watching, boating, or to participate in other outdoor activities that 
are part of a healthy lifestyle.
The true strength of our Nation lies in the hearts and souls of our 
citizens, and I urge all Americans not only to visit our parks and 
recreation areas, but also to volunteer their time and talents to help 
maintain the beauty of our environment. Good stewardship of the 
environment is not just a personal responsibility, it is a public value; 
and citizens who lend a hand to local parks and public lands are vital 
to the preservation of our Nation's many special places. Americans can 
take pride in the remarkable progress we continue to make in conserving 
our environment and natural resources.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2004 as Great 
Outdoors Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this month

[[Page 50]]

with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to participate in safe 
and enjoyable outdoor recreation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7796 of June 12, 2004

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than 200 years, the American flag has served as a symbol of our 
country's enduring freedom and unity. Old Glory has welcomed generations 
of immigrants to America's shores and is displayed proudly on homes, at 
schools, and over businesses across our country. During times of war, 
our flag has rallied our citizens to defend the blessings of liberty at 
home and abroad. It has accompanied our troops into battle and been 
given to grieving families at the grave sites of fallen heroes. Today, 
as our brave men and women in uniform fight terrorism and advance 
freedom, the flag inspires patriotism and pride across our Nation and 
around the world.
Each year on June 14, we honor the American flag and recall the adoption 
of our first official national flag by the Continental Congress in 1777. 
The first Flag Day observances began quietly in the 19th century as 
State and local celebrations recognizing the anniversary of the Stars 
and Stripes. Inspired by these patriotic gatherings, President Woodrow 
Wilson established the first national observance by proclamation in 
1916. To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and 
for the display of the Flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution 
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President 
issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all citizens of the 
United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2004, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 13, 2004, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
suitable places. I also call upon the people of the United States to 
observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through 
Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a 
time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings 
and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the 
Flag of the United States of America.

[[Page 51]]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7797 of June 19, 2004

Father's Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A special bond exists between a father and his children. On Father's 
Day, we recognize the important role fathers play in the American 
family, and we honor them for their strength, love, and commitment.
After listening to a church service on Mother's Day 1909, Sonora Dodd 
proposed a day to honor fathers. She was inspired by the courage and 
sacrifice of her own father, a Civil War veteran, who reared six 
children by himself after his wife's death. As others began to celebrate 
it, the idea for Father's Day spread across America. In 1966, President 
Lyndon Johnson officially proclaimed Father's Day as a national 
observance.
Fathers have a duty to love their children with all their hearts and 
prepare them to be independent, compassionate, and responsible citizens. 
A father's words and actions are critical in shaping the character of 
his children. A father's love helps teach them right from wrong, 
explains to them the consequences of bad decisions, and strengthens them 
with encouragement.
As we honor our fathers on this day, we express our heartfelt 
appreciation for their leadership, support, and protection for their 
children and families. We particularly recognize the many fathers who 
are far from home, serving our Nation and defending the cause of freedom 
around the world. They have answered a great call and live by a code of 
honor and duty that serves as an example for their sons and daughters 
and for all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 20, 
2004, as Father's Day. I encourage all Americans to express love, 
admiration, and thanks to their fathers for their contributions to our 
lives and to society. I direct the appropriate officials of the 
Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government 
buildings on this day. I also call upon State and local governments and 
citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7798 of June 22, 2004

Black Music Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The creativity and variety of African-American composers, singers, and 
musicians have shaped America's artistic and cultural landscape. During 
Black Music Month, we celebrate and honor the extraordinary impact of 
African-American music on our Nation's musical heritage.
The artistry of black musicians changes as each generation brings new 
talent and trends. Yet, there is a continuous theme. From the profound 
spirituality of African indigenous faith that influenced gospel, through 
the development of blues and jazz, to the emergence of rhythm and blues 
and rock and roll, we hear the richness of the African-American 
experience, past and present.
The earliest African-American music echoed the struggle of the 
oppressed, the trust of the faithful, and the endurance of the weary. We 
hear the voice of hope in work songs, hymns, psalms, and spirituals. The 
musical expression that captured the struggle for freedom and equality 
formed the foundation for gospel, blues, and jazz. African-American 
churchgoers transformed early spirituals into gospel music, giving voice 
to praises that still move listeners today. In the early 20th century, 
performers like Ida Cox and Tommy Johnson gave life to the improvised 
performances and style of the blues. As artists migrated to cities, the 
blues developed into an urban phenomenon and evolved into a major force 
in contemporary music.
During the same period, early pioneers such as Duke Ellington and Jelly 
Roll Morton were merging African musical roots with popular and church 
music to create a distinctively American sound: jazz. Songs first played 
in clubs in New Orleans, Memphis, and Chicago are now recognized and 
loved around the world. As jazz has expanded beyond its acoustic roots, 
African-American dreams, hopes, and joys have remained at the music's 
core.
The brilliance of new musical expressions emerged with rhythm and blues 
in the 1940s and rock and roll in the 1950s. Songs from great artists 
performing today embody the enduring appeal of this music. As black 
music continues to bring enjoyment to us all, the commemoration of this 
month expresses our Nation's recognition of its influence and our pride 
in its legacy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2004 as Black Music 
Month. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the history of 
black music and to enjoy the great contributions of African-American 
musicians.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
eighth.

Proclamation 7799 of June 26, 2004

National HIV Testing Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, 8,000 lives are lost in the global AIDS pandemic. In our 
country, nearly 1 million people are infected with HIV, and 
approximately 40,000 more contract it each year. National HIV Testing 
Day is an opportunity for Americans to increase their awareness of this 
terrible disease and to get tested for HIV/AIDS. By working together to 
end this pandemic, our Nation's citizens contribute to a brighter future 
for themselves and for people around the world.
New drugs and new treatments are bringing hope and enhancing the quality 
of life for those who are affected by HIV/AIDS. However, these advances 
can only help individuals if they know their HIV status. The National 
HIV Testing Day theme, ``It's better to know,'' highlights the 
importance of education in helping people make healthy decisions about 
preventing and treating HIV/AIDS. Approximately one-quarter of people 
who are HIV positive do not know that they are carriers. Without knowing 
their status, they cannot get the treatment they need and may 
unknowingly spread new infections. Today, testing is easier than ever. 
It is imperative that those at risk for HIV/AIDS get tested.
To reach out to HIV/AIDS sufferers in need, I recently announced $20 
million in immediate new funding to deliver lifesaving drugs to 
Americans who are awaiting them. I have proposed in my 2005 budget to 
spend more than $17 billion here at home to expand prevention efforts 
such as regular testing and abstinence education, care and treatment, 
and research efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. In addition, this budget 
proposal doubles funding for abstinence-only programs, because 
abstinence is the only sure way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. 
My Administration is working through the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's Advancing HIV Prevention initiative to encourage routine 
testing as a normal part of health care. At-risk individuals who make 
the decision to get tested are taking a step toward saving their own 
lives and the lives of others.
My Administration is also fully engaged in the global fight against HIV/
AIDS. I have proposed a record $15 billion over 5 years to combat the 
spread of HIV/AIDS around the world, with a focus on some of the 
hardest-hit countries of Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia. This money 
will be used to prevent 7 million new infections, treat 2 million HIV-
infected people with life-extending drugs, and care for 10 million 
individuals impacted by this disease, including orphans.
And, working with international partners, we will support intensified 
research to create a vaccine and find a cure. While AIDS remains a 
source of great suffering for many individuals, worldwide efforts are 
bringing us closer to the day when AIDS will be defeated.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 27, 2004, as National 
HIV Testing Day. I encourage the American people to support the battle

[[Page 54]]

against HIV/AIDS. I also urge those at risk to get tested for the 
disease and to learn more about how to end this health threat in America 
and around the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7800 of June 30, 2004

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(1)), the President may 
withdraw, suspend, or limit designation of specified articles provided 
for in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) as 
eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP) when imported from designated beneficiary 
developing countries.
2. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary developing countries, except those 
designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries pursuant to section 
503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to 
competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment afforded 
under the GSP to eligible articles.
3. Section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(C)) 
provides that a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary 
developing country with respect to an eligible article may be 
redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such 
article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the 
competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) during the 
preceding calendar year.
4. Section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)) 
provides that the President may disregard the competitive need 
limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any 
beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the 
imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
5. Pursuant to section 503(d) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)), the 
President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations 
in section 503(c)(2)(A) with respect to any eligible article from any 
beneficiary developing country if certain conditions are met.
6. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered 
the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 
2462(c)),

[[Page 55]]

I have determined that it is appropriate to withdraw the designation of 
certain articles as eligible articles under the GSP when imported from 
any beneficiary developing country. In order to do so for two of the 
articles, it is necessary to subdivide and amend the nomenclature of 
existing subheadings of the HTS.
7. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered 
the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I have determined to 
limit the application of duty-free treatment accorded to a certain 
article from a certain beneficiary developing country.
8. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) and 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I 
have determined that certain beneficiary countries should no longer 
receive preferential tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to 
certain eligible articles that were imported in quantities exceeding the 
applicable competitive need limitation in 2003.
9. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that certain countries should be redesignated as beneficiary developing 
countries with respect to certain eligible articles that previously had 
been imported in quantities exceeding the competitive need limitations 
of section 503(c)(2)(A).
10. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) should be waived with respect to certain eligible 
articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.
11. Pursuant to section 503(d) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that 
the competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) should be 
waived with respect to certain eligible articles from certain 
beneficiary developing countries. I have received the advice of the 
International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the United 
States are likely to be adversely affected by such waiver, and I have 
determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in 
sections 501 and 502(c), that such waivers are in the national economic 
interest of the United States.
12. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461-7, 2483), do 
proclaim that:
    (1) In order to provide that one or more countries that have not 
been treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or 
more eligible articles be redesignated as beneficiary developing 
countries with respect to such article or articles for purposes of the 
GSP, and, in order to provide that one or more countries no longer be 
treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to one or more 
eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, general note 4(d) to the HTS 
is modified as provided in section A of Annex I to this proclamation.

[[Page 56]]

    (2) In order to withdraw the designation of certain articles as 
eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the HTS is modified by 
amending and subdividing the nomenclature of certain existing HTS 
subheadings as provided in section B of Annex I to this proclamation.
    (3) (a) In order to provide preferential tariff treatment under the 
GSP to a beneficiary developing country that has been excluded from the 
benefits of the GSP for certain eligible articles, the Rates of Duty 1-
Special subcolumn for such HTS subheadings is modified as provided for 
in section C(1) of Annex I to this proclamation.

   (b) In order to provide that one or more countries not be treated as a 
beneficiary developing country with respect to certain eligible articles 
for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for such HTS 
subheadings is modified as provided for in section C(2) of Annex I to this 
proclamation.

   (c) In order to withdraw preferential tariff treatment under the GSP for 
a certain article imported from any beneficiary developing country, the 
Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for such HTS subheading is modified as 
provided for in section C(3) of Annex I to this proclamation.

    (4) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) (i)(II) of 
the 1974 Act shall apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings 
and to the beneficiary developing countries listed in Annex II to this 
proclamation.
    (5) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 
Act shall apply to the eligible article in the HTS subheading and to the 
beneficiary developing country listed in Annex III to this proclamation.
    (6) Any provisions of previous proclamations or Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (7) (a) The modifications made by Annex I to this proclamation shall 
be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after July 1, 2004.

  (b) The actions taken in Annex II to this proclamation shall be effective 
on July 1, 2004.

  (c) The action taken in Annex III to this proclamation shall be effective 
on the date of this proclamation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7801 of July 2, 2004

Returning the Flag of the United States to Full-Staff

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

By the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in honor 
and tribute to the memory of Ronald Reagan, it is hereby ordered that 
the flag of the United States shall be displayed at full-staff at the 
White House and on all buildings, grounds, and Naval vessels of the 
United States beginning July 3, 2004. I also direct that beginning on 
that same date, the representatives of the United States in foreign 
countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at 
full-staff over their Embassies, Legations, and other facilities abroad, 
including all military facilities and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of July, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7802 of July 16, 2004

Captive Nations Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year during Captive Nations Week, the United States reaffirms our 
commitment to building a world where human rights, democracy, and 
freedom are respected and protected by the rule of law. As Americans, we 
believe the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity must be upheld 
without regard to race, gender, creed, or nationality. We stand in 
solidarity with those living under repressive regimes who seek democracy 
and peaceful changes in their homelands.
Throughout our Nation's history, our brave men and women in uniform have 
fought for the freedom of those suffering under authoritarian 
governments. From Nazi Germany to Bosnia, and Afghanistan to Iraq, 
American service members have fought to remove brutal leaders. The 
American people and their generous contributions have helped to rebuild 
traumatized nations and given the oppressed hope for the future. More 
than a year ago, American service members and our coalition partners 
freed the Iraqi people from a dictatorship that routinely tortured and 
executed innocent civilians. Since then, Americans have helped the Iraqi 
people establish institutions for the protection of human rights, based 
on democratic principles, to ensure that freedom will endure in the new 
Iraq.

[[Page 61]]

Earlier this summer, as our Nation paid respect to President Ronald 
Reagan, we recognized his contributions to ending the Cold War and 
advancing freedom around the world. In his first Inaugural Address, 
President Reagan said: ``Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or 
no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and 
moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in 
today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans do 
have.'' These words carry forward today as we continue to push for 
democratic freedoms and human rights around the world.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week in July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 18 through July 24, 2004, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to reaffirm 
their commitment to all those seeking liberty, justice, and self-
determination.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7803 of July 23, 2004

Parents' Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Parents are a source of hope, help, stability, and love for their 
children. Parents also teach children important values like courage, 
compassion, self-reliance, reverence, integrity, and respect for others. 
As we celebrate Parents' Day, we recognize the important contributions 
of America's parents and renew our commitment to standing with our 
families to help them raise healthy, responsible children.
Parenthood is a privilege and a great joy that comes with great 
responsibility. Mothers and fathers play the vital roles of provider, 
nurturer, disciplinarian, counselor, advocate, educator, and motivator. 
They offer unconditional love and help their children to realize their 
dreams. As parents work to send the right messages to our young people, 
they shape the character and future of our Nation.
To help strengthen American families and encourage parents' active 
involvement in the lives of their children, my Administration is 
committed to promoting healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood. We 
are providing information to parents on early childhood education and 
development and supporting community-based parenting education programs. 
We are also providing parents with more options in educating their 
children and more opportunities to adopt young boys and girls in need.

[[Page 62]]

On Parents' Day, we honor America's mothers and fathers for their 
guidance, support, and unconditional love for their children. The 
tireless efforts of parents, stepparents, adoptive parents, and foster 
parents make our Nation stronger and help build a better future for all 
our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, as 
amended, do hereby proclaim Sunday, July 25, 2004, as Parents' Day. I 
encourage all Americans to express their love, respect, and appreciation 
to parents across our Nation. I also call upon citizens to observe this 
day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7804 of July 26, 2004

Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) marked a milestone in 
our Nation's quest to guarantee the civil rights of all citizens. The 
ADA is a success story that has strengthened the foundation for an 
America where we celebrate the talents and abilities of every person.
On the 14th anniversary of this landmark legislation, we recognize the 
important progress the ADA has brought about for our citizens and our 
Nation. Today, individuals with disabilities are better able to develop 
meaningful skills, engage in productive work, and participate fully in 
society. Yet, our work is not finished. The millions of Americans with 
disabilities continue to face both physical barriers and false 
perceptions. Removing those obstacles requires a determined and focused 
commitment to the goals of the ADA: equality of opportunity, economic 
self-sufficiency, full participation, and independent living.
My Administration continues its work to achieve these goals. My New 
Freedom Initiative, announced in February 2001, sets out a comprehensive 
strategy for the full integration of people with disabilities into all 
aspects of American life. The Department of Justice has established the 
ADA Business Connection to build partnerships between the business 
community and people with disabilities. This program helps increase 
voluntary compliance with the ADA and brings individuals with 
disabilities into the mainstream of our economy. Through Project Civic 
Access, we have reached agreements with cities and towns across the 
country to ensure that people with disabilities are integrated into 
community life. In addition, I have signed executive orders that remove 
barriers to equal opportunities faced by people with disabilities.

[[Page 63]]

On July 22, 2004, I signed an Executive Order that makes government 
agencies responsible for properly taking into account agency employees 
and customers with disabilities in emergency preparedness planning and 
coordination with other government entities. To help coordinate this 
effort, the Executive Order establishes the Interagency Coordinating 
Council on Emergency Preparedness and Individuals with Disabilities.
I also signed an Executive Order on February 24, 2004, to improve 
transportation for people who are transportation-disadvantaged, 
including people with disabilities. This order helps Federally assisted 
community transportation services provide seamless, comprehensive, and 
accessible transportation services to people who rely on transportation 
services for their lives and livelihood.
My Administration has also begun implementing the recommendations of the 
New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. The Commission was established 
by Executive Order and its report lays out steps that can be taken to 
improve mental health services and support for people of all ages with 
mental illness.
By striving to ensure that no American is denied access to employment, 
education, cultural activities, or community life because of a 
disability, we strengthen our Nation. Through these and other efforts, 
we will continue to build on the progress of the ADA, and, by doing so, 
hold fast to our Nation's faith in the promise and potential of every 
person.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2004, as a day in 
celebration of the 14th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the contributions people 
with disabilities make to America and to renew our commitment to 
upholding the fundamental principles of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7805 of August 16, 2004

National Airborne Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans look to the members of our Armed Forces as examples of honor 
and patriotism. On National Airborne Day, we commemorate the first 
official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940, and salute a 
distinguished group of individuals whose courage and dedication have 
earned them a cherished place in American history.

[[Page 64]]

Our Nation's Airborne forces have helped liberate millions from 
oppression and extend peace and freedom around the world. From the 
initial tests of this new medium of warfare, to the establishment of 
venerable units serving today, these brave men and women have expanded 
the vision and capabilities of our Armed Forces. The Army designated the 
first Airborne division on August 15, 1942, and the 82nd Airborne 
Division set the standard for achievement and built a proud legacy of 
service. Many units followed in their footsteps, fighting bravely in 
battle and serving our country with distinction in World War II, Korea, 
Vietnam, and other critical missions.
Today's Airborne forces continue the tradition of excellence and 
determination as we fight the global war on terror. In Afghanistan and 
Iraq, they have helped advance peace and democracy and defended the 
American people from danger. We are grateful for their service and 
continue to stand solidly behind the men and women of our Airborne 
forces, and all those in our military, as they serve on the front lines 
of freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 16, 2004, as 
National Airborne Day. I encourage all Americans to join me in honoring 
those who have served in the Airborne forces. I call upon all citizens 
to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7806 of August 26, 2004

Women's Equality Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Women's Equality Day, we recognize the hard work and perseverance of 
those who helped secure women's suffrage in the United States. With the 
ratification of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1920, American 
women gained one of the most cherished rights and fundamental 
responsibilities of citizenship: the right to vote.
The struggle for women's suffrage in America dates back to the founding 
of our country. The movement began in earnest at the Seneca Falls 
Convention in 1848, when women drafted a Declaration of Sentiments 
proclaiming they had the same rights as men. In 1916, Jeannette Rankin 
of Montana became the first American woman elected to the United States 
House of Representatives, despite the fact that her fellow women would 
not be able to vote nationally for 4 more years. These women and many 
more like them worked to ensure that future generations of women could 
realize the promise of America.

[[Page 65]]

Today, American women are leaders in business, government, law, science, 
medicine, the arts, education, and many other fields. Women-owned 
businesses account for nearly half of all privately held firms and are 
opening at twice the rate of male-owned businesses. Through vision, 
determination, and a strong work ethic, remarkable American women have 
broadened opportunities for themselves and women around the world.
The full participation of women and the protection of their rights as 
citizens are essential for freedom and democracy to flourish. In 
Afghanistan, women helped draft their country's new constitution in 
January 2004, which guarantees free elections and full participation by 
women. These women are eager to exercise their rights and are 
registering to vote in great numbers; about 40 percent of those 
registered to vote in the October Afghan Presidential elections are 
women. In Iraq, women are members of the new interim Iraqi government 
and the recently established National Council. They also participated in 
drafting the Transitional Administrative Law, which prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of gender, ethnicity, or religion and 
requires that 25 percent of the new legislature be women. In the face of 
great challenges, Iraqi women are building a better nation for 
themselves and their families.
As we look to the future, we celebrate the extraordinary accomplishments 
of women in America and throughout the world and renew our commitment to 
equality for all women, both at home and abroad.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2004, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7807 of September 4, 2004

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Minority businesses are a key component of the American economy and 
reflect the values that make our country strong. They create 
opportunities for workers, provide goods and services to consumers, and 
strengthen our communities. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, 
we celebrate the achievements of minority businesses and emphasize our 
commitment to creating an environment in which these entrepreneurs can 
succeed.
All of America benefits from the strong and vibrant entrepreneurial 
spirit of our small business owners. By reducing taxes, encouraging 
investment, and removing obstacles to growth, my Administration has 
helped American

[[Page 66]]

businesses thrive and create nearly 1.7 million new jobs since August 
2003. In addition, the number of Small Business Administration loans to 
minorities increased by 40 percent last year to a 50-year record level. 
And my fiscal year 2005 budget request includes a 21 percent increase in 
funding for the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development 
Agency, the largest increase in more than a decade.
To help provide sustainable outreach to minority enterprises, my 
Administration is working with the National Urban League to create an 
entrepreneurship network to further expand minority business ownership. 
With the help of government agencies, the private sector, and faith-
based and community organizations, this network will include one-stop 
centers for business training, counseling, financing, and contracting 
and will focus resources toward facilitating economic growth and 
enterprise in historically neglected areas.
More minorities own small businesses than ever before. That is good for 
our citizens and good for our country. Together, we can create an 
environment where entrepreneurs can flourish and everyone can realize 
the American Dream.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 5 through 
September 11, 2004, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon 
all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities and to recognize the countless contributions 
of our Nation's minority enterprises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7808 of September 7, 2004

To Modify the Generalized System of Preferences, and For Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a)(1) of Title V of the Trade Act of 
1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2461, 2462(a)(1)), the 
President is authorized to designate countries as beneficiary developing 
countries for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
2. Pursuant to section 503(d) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)), the 
President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations 
in section 503(c)(2)(A) (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)) with respect to any 
eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain 
conditions are met.

[[Page 67]]

3. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(5)), 
any waiver granted under section 503(d) shall remain in effect until the 
President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to 
changed circumstances.
4. Section 7(a) of the AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-
274) (``AGOA Acceleration Act'') amended section 506A of the GSP (19 
U.S.C. 2466a) to provide certain benefits to any country designated as a 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under section 506A(a) of the GSP 
that becomes a party to a free trade agreement with the United States, 
and amended section 506B of the GSP (19 U.S.C. 2466b) to extend the 
period during which preferential treatment may be accorded to such 
countries.
5. Section 7(b) through (f) of the AGOA Acceleration Act amended section 
112 of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Title I of the Trade and 
Development Act of 2000, Public Law 106-200) (AGOA) (19 U.S.C. 3721) to 
modify the type and quantity of textile and apparel articles eligible 
for the preferential treatment now accorded to designated beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African countries, and to provide certain benefits to any 
such country that becomes a party to a free trade agreement with the 
United States.
6. On December 17, 1992, the Governments of Canada, Mexico, and the 
United States entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA). The Congress approved the NAFTA in section 101(a) of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``NAFTA 
Implementation Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3311(a)), and the President implemented 
the tariff provisions of the NAFTA with respect to the United States in 
Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993.
7. Section 201(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3331(a)) 
authorizes the President to proclaim such duty modifications as the 
President may determine to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or 
apply, among other provisions, Article 308 and Annex 308.1 of the NAFTA.
8. NAFTA Article 308 and Annex 308.1 provide for each NAFTA Party to 
eliminate or reduce normal trade relations (most-favored-nation) rates 
of duty on certain automatic data processing machinery and parts, and 
set the terms under which such goods shall be considered originating 
goods under the NAFTA when imported from the territory of a NAFTA Party.
9. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having 
due regard for the factors set forth in section 501 of the 1974 Act and 
taking into account the factors set forth in section 502(c) of the 1974 
Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have decided to designate Iraq as a 
beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
10. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that a previously granted waiver of the competitive need limitations of 
section 503(c)(2)(A) is no longer warranted due to changed 
circumstances.
11. In order to implement the tariff treatment provided under section 7 
of the AGOA Acceleration Act, it is necessary to modify the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).
12. I have determined that each NAFTA Party has eliminated or reduced 
its normal trade relations (most-favored-nation) rates of duty 
applicable to the goods enumerated in Table 308.1.1 of NAFTA Annex 308.1 
to the levels prescribed in that Table. Annex 308.1 provides for those 
goods to be

[[Page 68]]

originating goods under the NAFTA when imported from Canada or Mexico.
13. Pursuant to section 201(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, I have 
determined that the modifications to the HTS hereinafter proclaimed 
concerning goods considered to be originating when imported from the 
territory of a NAFTA Party are necessary and appropriate to carry out or 
apply Article 308 and Annex 308.1 of the NAFTA.
14. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
Title V and section 604 of the 1974 Trade Act, section 112 of the AGOA, 
and section 201(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, do proclaim that:
    (1) Iraq is designated as a beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP, effective 15 days after the date of this 
proclamation.
    (2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 
4(a) to the HTS is modified by adding ``Iraq'' to the list entitled 
``Independent Countries'', effective with respect to articles entered, 
or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 15 days after 
the date of this proclamation.
    (3) In order to provide that a country no longer be treated as a 
beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article for 
purposes of the GSP, general note 4(d) to the HTS is modified as 
provided in section 1 of Annex I.
    (4) In order to withdraw preferential tariff treatment under the GSP 
for a certain article imported from a certain beneficiary developing 
country, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for such HTS subheading 
is modified as provided for in section 2 of Annex I to this 
proclamation.
    (5) The waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 
1974 Act to the article in the HTS subheading and to the beneficiary 
developing country listed in section 3 of Annex I to this proclamation 
is revoked.
    (6) In order to provide for the preferential treatment provided for 
in section 506A and 506B of the GSP, as amended by section 7(a) of the 
AGOA Acceleration Act, and section 112 of the AGOA, as amended by 
sections 7(b) through (f) of the AGOA Acceleration Act, the HTS is 
modified as provided in Annex II to this proclamation.
    (7) In order to implement Article 308 and Annex 308.1 of the NAFTA 
for certain automatic data processing machinery and parts imported from 
Canada and Mexico, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex III to this 
proclamation.
    (8) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with this proclamation are superseded to the 
extent of such inconsistency.

[[Page 69]]

    (9) The modifications made by and action taken in Annex I to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to eligible articles 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 60 
days after the date of this proclamation.
    (10) The modifications made by Annex II shall be effective with 
respect to eligible articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after July 13, 2004, except that the modifications 
made by section 4(A) relating to increases in the quantity of certain 
articles eligible for duty-free treatment shall be effective with 
respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after the dates provided in that section.
    (11) The modifications made by Annex III shall be effective with 
respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, 
on or after January 1, 2003.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7809 of September 10, 2004

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our country, millions of Americans suffer from the debilitating 
effects of alcohol and drug abuse. Substance abuse shatters lives, 
divides families, and robs people of their promise and potential.
My Administration is confronting these dangers. We are pursuing an 
ambitious, focused strategy to cut demand for drugs at home, disrupt 
supplies abroad, and ensure that citizens living with addiction get the 
treatment they need. We have made progress in fighting substance abuse, 
but there is more to do.
One of the worst decisions our children can make is to endanger their 
lives and their futures with alcohol or drugs. My Administration is 
addressing this problem with a strategy of education, treatment, and law 
enforcement. We also support random student drug testing as a prevention 
tool. We are seeing the results of all of these efforts, as more of our 
young people are also choosing to avoid alcohol and drugs. Drug use 
among youth has declined by 11 percent from 2001 to 2003.
My Administration is committed to expanding the choice of service 
providers for those struggling with addiction. We recognize the success 
of faith-based and community approaches in which caring citizens join 
together to offer alternatives to traditional treatment, helping people 
change habits by changing their hearts. Through the Access to Recovery 
initiative, we have provided an additional $100 million in new grants 
this year to expand options for substance abuse treatment and recovery 
support services through vouchers, which allow individuals to choose the 
services that best meet their recovery needs. In my 2005 budget, I have 
proposed doubling funding for this initiative to further expand 
treatment. In total, I have requested $3.7 billion for drug treatment 
and research programs for 2005, an increase of about 25 percent since 
2001.
The struggle against substance abuse is a community effort, and this 
month is an opportunity to further raise awareness and support the fight 
against the destructive cycle of addiction. I call on all Americans to 
make responsible and healthy choices so that everyone can realize the 
great promise of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2004 as National 
Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7810 of September 10, 2004

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ovarian cancer affects thousands of Americans each year. During this 
time of tremendous medical breakthroughs, we are seeing progress in the 
effort to overcome this disease, but our work is not finished. National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month provides an opportunity for our citizens 
to learn more about early detection and treatment for this deadly 
cancer.
Although new cases of ovarian cancer in the United States have been 
decreasing for more than a decade, the American Cancer Society estimates 
that about 25,000 women will be diagnosed this year and over 16,000 will 
die from the disease. Family and personal history can affect the 
likelihood of developing ovarian cancer. Women should talk with their 
doctors and health care providers about preventative screenings and the 
benefits and risks of different tests. Understanding risk factors and 
the importance of a healthy lifestyle plays a vital role in our efforts 
to save lives and reduce the number of women who suffer from ovarian 
cancer.
As with many cancers, the chance for successful treatment of ovarian 
cancer increases with early detection. The medical community continues 
to work on developing an effective screening test that can detect the 
disease in its early stages when symptoms may not exist or are very 
difficult to diagnose. The National Institutes of Health has invested 
more than $120 million this year in ovarian cancer research and expects 
to invest more in 2005. Through the National Cancer Institute's Ovarian 
Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Study, scientists are following 
women at increased risk for the cancer to assess how preemptive surgery 
and screening methods affect ovarian cancer occurrence and quality of 
life. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Ovarian Cancer 
Control Initiative will also focus on factors related to early detection 
and treatment.
The United States continues to stay on the leading edge of new 
discoveries in medicine, and my Administration remains committed to 
providing the resources necessary to learn the causes, understand the 
symptoms, and find a cure for ovarian cancer. During this month, we 
reaffirm our dedication to these goals and recognize the strength and 
courage of the women who have suffered from this disease. We also 
recognize the families, friends, and loved ones who support and 
encourage these brave women. By working together, we can bring the hope 
of a healthier future to women in the fight against ovarian cancer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2004 as National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 7811 of September 10, 2004

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On September 11, 2001, America was attacked with deliberate and massive 
cruelty. We remember the tragedy of that day. We remember the images of 
fire, and the final calls of love, and the courage of rescuers who saw 
death and did not flee. We remember the many good lives that ended too 
soon. We remember the families left behind to carry a burden of sorrow; 
they have shown a courage of their own. During this year's National Days 
of Prayer and Remembrance, Americans join together to pray for those who 
were lost, and for their loved ones.
Since that day, our Nation has waged a relentless war against terror and 
evil. We pray for the brave men and women of the United States Armed 
Forces who are serving our country on the front lines of this war. They 
have answered a great call, and our Nation is grateful for their 
courage, love of country, and dedication to duty. We recognize the 
sacrifice of military families and pray that they find comfort in faith 
and in knowing that their loved ones are serving an historic cause--
defending our country and advancing peace and freedom in the world.
On this third anniversary of September 11th, we feel the warm courage of 
national unity--a unity of grief and a unity of resolve. And we pray 
that God will continue to watch over and bless America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 10, 
through Sunday, September 12, 2004, as National Days of Prayer and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States and places of 
worship mark these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance with memorial 
services, the ringing of bells, and evening candlelight remembrance 
vigils. I invite the people of the world to share in these Days of 
Prayer and Remembrance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7812 of September 10, 2004

Patriot Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Three years ago, our country was ruthlessly attacked, and more than 
3,000 innocent people lost their lives. We will always remember the 
victims: sons and daughters, husbands and wives, dads and moms, family 
members, co-workers, and friends. And we will always be inspired by the 
heroism and decency of our fellow citizens on that day. Police, 
firefighters, emergency rescue personnel, doctors, nurses, and many 
others risked their own lives to save the lives of their fellow 
citizens. They demonstrated the great character and bravery of our 
Nation, and they embody the great spirit of America.
Since September 11th, America has fought a relentless war on terror 
around the world. We are staying on the offensive in this war--striking 
the terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home. We 
pray that God watch over our brave men and women in uniform and all who 
are waging this war and working to keep America safe. And we pray for 
their families. In the face of danger, America is showing its character. 
Three years after the attack on our country, Americans remain strong and 
resolute, patient in a just cause, and confident of the victory to come.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as ``Patriot 
Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2004, as Patriot Day. I call 
upon the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of government, to 
direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Patriot Day. I call upon 
the people of the United States to observe Patriot Day with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, to display 
the flag at half-staff from their homes on that day, and to observe a 
moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor 
the innocent victims who lost their lives as a result of the terrorist 
attacks of September 11, 2001.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the

ninth.

Proclamation 7813 of September 14, 2004

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We have made dramatic progress in the battle against prostate cancer. 
However, prostate cancer is still the most commonly diagnosed form of 
cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer-related death among 
American men. During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we again 
demonstrate our Nation's commitment to the prevention, research, and 
treatment of this disease.
Studies have shown that men with certain risk factors are more likely to 
develop prostate cancer. Age is the most significant factor--most men 
with prostate cancer are older than 65. Family history, a diet high in 
animal fats or meat, and certain other factors may also increase the 
likelihood of developing this disease. As we work to better understand 
the factors contributing to prostate cancer, I urge all men to talk to 
their doctors about the best course of action to reduce their own risk.
Although we cannot yet prevent prostate cancer, we know that early 
detection and treatment often make the difference between life and 
death. Screenings available include blood tests and physical 
examinations that can help detect the cancer at earlier, less dangerous 
stages. Researchers and scientists are also working to find more 
effective treatments that will give patients and their families greater 
hope. My Administration is committed to funding vital research and 
finding a cure for prostate cancer. Currently, the National Cancer 
Institute is sponsoring the largest prostate cancer prevention clinical 
trial ever conducted. The National Institutes of Health invested $379 
million in prostate cancer research in 2003, and plans to spend almost 
$400 million this year and an estimated $417 million in 2005. In 
addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department 
of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs are playing essential 
roles in efforts to translate research into effective treatments.
To help save lives and raise awareness of prostate cancer, I urge all 
Americans to talk with family and friends about the importance of 
screening and early detection. By educating ourselves and others about 
this disease, we can improve our ability to prevent, detect, treat, and 
ultimately cure prostate cancer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2004 as National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and all people of the United States to reaffirm our Nation's 
strong and continuing commitment to control and cure prostate cancer.

Proclamation 7814 of September 14, 2004

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of 
Education and the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we 
recognize our Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for 
their extraordinary accomplishments in education and for extending the 
promise of our Nation's founding to all of our citizens. Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities were created to educate African 
Americans when they were wrongly denied the opportunity to attend school 
during the 19th century. Today, these great institutions continue to 
advance equal opportunity and excellence in education. In 2002, HBCUs 
enrolled 14 percent of all African Americans attending college. Their 
graduates are leaders in medicine, education, government, the military, 
business, the arts, the law, and many other fields. They include such 
heroes as Thurgood Marshall, who led the struggle for equal justice 
under law for African Americans and successfully represented African-
American schoolchildren in Brown.
Half a century after the Supreme Court's historic decision in Brown, 
America is still working to reach the high calling of its ideals. 
Education remains the path to equality and opportunity, and HBCUs are a 
vital part of our national commitment to improving education for all of 
our citizens. Funding for HBCUs is now at an all-time high. By providing 
students with a quality education, HBCUs are continuing to help America 
remain a place of opportunity and hope for every citizen.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12 through 
September 18, 2004, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this week with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to show our respect and 
appreciation for these remarkable institutions and their graduates.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7815 of September 14, 2004

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, when the enemies of freedom were on the march 
and our country needed brave Americans to take up arms and stop their 
advance, the members of our Armed Forces answered the call of duty. 
These patriotic men and women defended our country in hours of need and 
continue to stand watch for freedom. Many of these courageous 
individuals risked capture, imprisonment, and their lives to protect our 
homeland. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor the sacrifices 
and remarkable determination of those captured as prisoners of war. We 
also remember those who remain unaccounted for and ask for God's special 
blessing on their families. Our Nation will not forget these heroes, and 
we will not stop searching for our service members who are missing in 
action.
On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, the flag of the National League of 
Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia is flown 
over the White House, the Capitol, the Departments of State, Defense, 
and Veterans Affairs, the Selective Service System Headquarters, the 
National Vietnam Veterans and Korean War Veterans Memorials, U.S. 
military installations, national cemeteries, and other locations across 
our country. This flag serves as a reminder of our continued commitment 
to those still missing and those imprisoned while serving in World War 
II, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Kosovo, Iraq, and other 
conflicts. We remain grateful for their service and sacrifice and pledge 
to continue to achieve the fullest possible accounting for all of our 
men and women in uniform still missing.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 14, 2004, as 
National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I call upon the people of the United 
States to join me in saluting all American POWs and those missing in 
action who valiantly served our great country. I call upon Federal, 
State, and local government officials and private organizations to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7816 of September 17, 2004

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we recognize Hispanic Americans 
for helping to shape our national character and strengthen our 
communities. The warmth and vitality of the Hispanic culture are great 
gifts to America and are part of the unique fabric of our country.
Hispanic Americans have enriched our Nation through contributions in 
many professions and fields, including education, law, government, 
business, science, sports, and the arts. Since our Nation's founding, 
Hispanic Americans have served bravely in the United States Armed 
Forces, earning more than 3 dozen Medals of Honor and numerous 
distinguished military decorations for their leadership, courage, and 
patriotism. Today, Hispanic Americans in our Armed Forces, National 
Guard, and Reserve units continue this proud legacy as they stand watch 
on the front lines of freedom. The hard work, values, and devotion to 
community of Hispanic Americans set a positive example for all 
Americans.
Across our country, we are working to continue helping Hispanic 
Americans realize the great promise of America. In 2002, I set a goal of 
increasing the number of minority homeowners by at least 5.5 million by 
the end of the decade. We are making good progress--having added more 
than 1.6 million minority homeowners so far. My Administration's 
business agenda and economic policies have helped create an environment 
in which Latino small business owners in the United States are starting 
new businesses and employing millions of people, expanding trade 
throughout the Americas, and generating billions in revenue. Through the 
No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, we are working to ensure that schools 
are serving every student. In addition, we are committed to improving 
immigration services while strengthening national security.
I join with all Americans in celebrating the heritage, culture, spirit, 
and contributions of Hispanic Americans. To honor the achievements of 
Hispanic Americans, the Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has 
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
designating September 15 through October 15, as ``National Hispanic 
Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2004, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7817 of September 17, 2004

Citizenship Day and Constitution Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Two hundred and seventeen years ago this week, delegates to the 
Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia signed one of the most 
enduring documents in history: the Constitution of the United States. 
Our Constitution is the foundation of our liberty and has guaranteed the 
rights of our people through a history of tremendous change and 
progress.
Today, we marvel at the wisdom of the Framers who toiled through a long 
summer of learned and contentious debates. Their work produced a 
document that upholds high ideals, while answering the most practical 
questions of governance. The charter they crafted--with its separate 
branches of Government, enumerated powers, checks and balances, and 
later the specific protections provided by our Bill of Rights--guides 
our Nation and inspires others around the world.
During Constitution Week, our Nation reflects on the significance of our 
Constitution and gives thanks for the blessings of liberty that this 
document helps to secure. We honor the men and women who have supported 
and defended it throughout our history, at times with their lives. On 
Citizenship Day, we reaffirm our commitment to freedom, to ensuring that 
our history endures, and to instilling in America's next generation the 
values that make our country great.
In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 
U.S.C. 106, as amended), designated September 17 as ``Citizenship Day,'' 
and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108, as amended), 
requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 17 
and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2004, as Citizenship Day, and 
September 17 through September 23, 2004, as Constitution Week. I 
encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as well as leaders of 
civic, social, and educational organizations, to conduct ceremonies and 
programs that celebrate our Constitution and reaffirm our rights and 
obligations as citizens of our great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7818 of September 20, 2004

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's farm economy is strong and growing. Farm income is strong, 
farm exports are at a record high, and my Administration is working to 
ensure that American farm products are sold all over the world. During 
National Farm Safety and Health Week, we reflect on the contributions of 
America's farm and ranch families and underscore our commitment to 
making our farms safer and to protecting our farm and ranch land.
The safety and health of our farm and ranch families are of critical 
importance. These Americans perform tasks that contain risks--they 
operate farm machinery, apply agricultural chemicals and fertilizers, 
handle large and unpredictable livestock, and work in places where dusts 
and toxins can contaminate the air. We must continue to raise awareness 
of dangers and proper safety precautions and equipment, particularly 
among our young people involved in agriculture. Through education and 
training, we can help save lives and improve the well-being of our 
Nation's farmers and ranchers.
Our Nation's farmers and ranchers help feed and clothe people around the 
world, and they are now helping provide more energy for the American 
people. By promoting a safer farm and ranch environment, we can 
strengthen our agricultural economy and build a more prosperous future 
for all our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through 
September 25, 2004, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the agencies, organizations, and businesses that serve America's 
agricultural workers to strengthen their commitment to promoting farm 
safety and health programs. I also urge all Americans to honor our 
agricultural heritage and to recognize our farmers and ranchers for 
their remarkable contributions to our Nation's vitality and prosperity.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7819 of September 21, 2004

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, the members of the National Guard and Reserve 
have served our country with honor. Our Nation depends on the dedication 
of these citizen-soldiers, and our Guardsmen and Reservists rely on the 
support of their civilian employers to allow them to fulfill their 
service obligations. During National Employer Support of the Guard and 
Reserve Week, we honor the sacrifice of these brave men and women, and 
we express our gratitude for the commitment of their employers.
As we fight terror and advance freedom, members of the National Guard 
and Reserve are making vital contributions around the world as fully 
integrated components of our Nation's Armed Forces. At home, they are 
called on to protect our communities, preserve order, and provide 
assistance in times of natural disaster, balancing the demands of their 
families, civilian careers, and military commitments. These Guardsmen 
and Reservists are indispensable to our Nation's efforts to promote 
democracy, peace, and freedom around the world, and we salute their 
selfless service.
Employers also play a critical role in our Nation's defense, 
demonstrating their patriotism by supporting the training and 
mobilization of these brave individuals. Across America, business 
owners, school personnel, hospital administrators, and many others put 
our country's safety and security first when they provide time off, pay, 
health care benefits, and job security to their Guard and Reserve 
employees. These sacrifices help strengthen our country and allow our 
men and women in uniform to focus on the missions at hand. The 
generosity and public spirit of these employers have earned them the 
appreciation of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 26 through 
October 2, 2004, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve 
Week. I encourage all Americans to join me in expressing our thanks to 
the civilian employers and the members of our National Guard and Reserve 
for their patriotism and sacrifices on behalf of our Nation. I also call 
upon State and local officials, private organizations, businesses, and 
all military commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7820 of September 24, 2004

Family Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During this time of great change in our Nation, we remain dedicated to 
the fundamental American values of courage and compassion, reverence and 
integrity, and respect for others. On Family Day, we affirm our 
commitment to strengthening America's families and supporting them as 
they work to raise healthy and responsible children.
Strong families help young people take responsibility, understand the 
consequences of their actions, and recognize that the decisions they 
make today could affect the rest of their lives. By spending time with 
their children, parents prepare them to realize a bright future.
It should always be a goal of government to encourage marriage and 
strengthen families. My 2005 budget proposal includes more than $290 
million in funding for programs that support healthy marriages, research 
and demonstration projects on family formation, and initiatives to 
promote responsible fatherhood.
We have made significant progress over the past decade in helping our 
young people make the right choices. Smoking and illicit drug use have 
declined among youth, teen birth rates have fallen to the lowest levels 
ever recorded, and violent crime among teenagers has decreased 
dramatically. My Administration is also supporting families by 
encouraging character education in schools to help children develop a 
sense of responsibility to their communities. We are advancing 
abstinence-only education programs to help reduce the number of teen 
pregnancies and teenagers contracting sexually transmitted diseases, and 
we are promoting school drug testing to identify kids who need help. 
When parents, schools, and government work together, we can counter the 
negative influences in today's culture and send a positive message to 
our youth.
Families instill the essential values we live by. By supporting them, we 
make America a better and more hopeful place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 27, 2004, as 
Family Day. I call on the people of the United States to observe this 
day by engaging in activities that honor the relationship between 
parents and children and help keep our young people healthy and safe.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7821 of September 25, 2004

Gold Star Mother's Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans have always answered the call to serve our Nation. Many brave 
American men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend 
freedom's blessings, and no one feels their loss more deeply than their 
mothers. On Gold Star Mother's Day, we remember these mothers who have 
suffered the loss of a son or daughter through service to our country. 
We honor their courage and perseverance and the memory of their 
children.
Across our Nation, these compassionate and generous women are 
volunteering to serve veterans, helping families of service members, 
supporting educational programs that promote patriotism and citizenship, 
and turning their grief into action. They inspire all Americans with 
their compassion and service. On this day, people across America join 
together to honor our Gold Star mothers and send our gratitude, prayers, 
and best wishes to them and to their families.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold 
Star Mother's Day,'' and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 26, 2004, as Gold Star 
Mother's Day. I call upon all Government officials to display the flag 
of the United States over Government buildings on this solemn day. I 
also encourage the American people to display the flag and hold 
appropriate meetings in their homes, places of worship, or other 
suitable places as a public expression of the sympathy and respect that 
our Nation holds for our Gold Star Mothers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the

National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America is a land of majestic beauty, and we take pride in our wildlife, 
forests, mountains, lakes, rivers, and coastlines. Outdoor recreation is 
an important part of our Nation's heritage. On National Hunting and 
Fishing Day, we celebrate the remarkable progress we have made in 
conserving our

[[Page 90]]

environment and recognize those who have worked to conserve our natural 
resources.
America's hunters and anglers represent the great spirit of our country 
and are among our Nation's foremost conservationists. These citizens 
have worked to protect habitat and restore fish and wildlife 
populations. They volunteer their time, talents, and energy to countless 
conservation projects, because they recognize the importance of 
maintaining the natural abundance of our country for future generations.
My Administration is committed to achieving a cleaner, safer, and 
healthier environment for all Americans, including our hunters and 
anglers. My Administration has expanded opportunities to hunt and fish 
at national wildlife refuges and improved habitat on public and private 
lands. We have cut phosphorus releases into our rivers and streams, and 
I signed the Healthy Forests Restoration Act to help protect our forests 
from the risk of wildfires.
Americans are blessed to live amid many wonders of nature, and we have a 
responsibility to be good stewards of the land. I commend all who 
advance conservation and help our citizens enjoy the benefits of our 
environment. These efforts ensure that our national heritage remains a 
source of pride for our citizens, our communities, and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 25, 2004, as 
National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon the people of the United

and anglers, and all those who work to conserve our Nation's fish and 
wildlife resources.

Proclamation 7823 of October 1, 2004

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we raise awareness of 
this deadly disease, encourage early detection, and support research to 
find a cure.
Prevention and early detection are key to winning the fight against 
breast cancer. Although the exact cause of the disease is unknown, 
factors that can affect the risk of developing cancer include age, 
general health, and family history. This year, estimates are that over 
200,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Regular screening 
for breast cancer continues

[[Page 91]]

to be the most effective way to detect this disease early and to save 
lives, and mammograms are the best screening tool we currently have. 
Women should talk to their health care providers about their breast 
cancer risk.
To improve the quality of life and find a cure for those affected by 
breast cancer, we are learning more about its causes. The National 
Institutes of Health has invested an estimated $700 million this year 
alone on breast cancer research and will spend more next year. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has devoted over $200 million 
this year and more next year for an early detection program that 
promotes mammograms and helps low-income women afford screenings for 
breast and cervical cancer. The Department of Defense also invested 
approximately $150 million for its Breast Cancer Research program in 
2004. This funding will help lead to better treatments for cancer 
patients and new hope for countless Americans and their families.
We salute breast cancer survivors for their courage and perseverance. 
Their courageous battle against cancer is an inspiration to countless 
Americans, and their willingness to share their stories and experiences 
helps spread awareness and offers hope and comfort to cancer patients 
across the country. Together with health care professionals, 
researchers, and family members, we can improve the lives of those 
suffering from this disease and win the fight against breast cancer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2004 as National 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and all the people of the United States to continue our 
Nation's strong commitment to controlling and curing breast cancer.

Proclamation 7824 of October 4, 2004

Fire Prevention Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Fire Prevention Week is an opportunity for all Americans to learn more 
about how to avoid fires, as well as how to best respond in case of such 
an emergency. By making fire safety a priority, we can help limit the 
devastating effects of fires and enhance the safety of our citizens.
A large majority of fire deaths in the United States occur in the home. 
This year's theme, ``It's Fire Prevention Week: Test Your Smoke 
Alarms,'' reflects the importance of installing and maintaining working 
smoke alarms on every floor of the home. As vital early warning systems, 
smoke alarms reduce the chances of a fire becoming fatal by 
approximately 50 percent.

[[Page 92]]

Americans can also take steps to reduce the chance of a fire ever 
starting. These include using electrical devices safely, avoiding 
overloading circuits, and carefully operating stoves, fireplaces, and 
space heaters. We should also supervise our children and educate them 
about the dangers of lighters and matches, exercise care in the storing 
of firewood and other flammable materials, and obey local burning laws. 
More information about these and other measures is available from the 
National Fire Protection Association and the Department of Homeland 
Security's United States Fire Administration.
Firefighters are among our greatest heroes, and they risk their lives 
each day to protect our citizens and our homeland. All Americans owe 
them a debt of gratitude for their courage and dedication. By working to 
prevent disasters and by being prepared, we support firefighters as they 
serve communities across our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 3 through October 
9, 2004, as Fire Prevention Week. I call upon the people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate activities and to undertake 
efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-

Proclamation 7825 of October 4, 2004

Child Health Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Parents play a vital role in keeping their children healthy, and when it 
comes to helping children make right choices, there is work for all 
Americans to do. Parents, teachers, faith-based and community groups, 
and government leaders are working together to counter the negative 
influences in today's culture, highlight the benefits of healthy 
lifestyles, and educate children about the consequences of their 
actions.
By promoting good nutrition and regular physical activity, parents help 
their children perform better in the classroom and live healthy lives. 
To encourage healthy families, my Administration is helping young people 
learn the simple steps to live better through the HealthierUS Initiative 
and the President's Challenge awards program. These programs encourage 
young people to eat a nutritious diet rich in fruits and vegetables and 
to set aside time every day for physical activity, such as playing 
sports, biking, or even helping with yard work at home. Encouraging 
healthy habits early in life helps give children a head start and gives 
them the best chance of reaching their potential.

[[Page 93]]

Our youth are challenged with tough choices. We must continue to promote 
responsibility among our Nation's young people by providing them with 
the knowledge they need to make the right decisions concerning drug and 
alcohol use. My Administration supports education programs that address 
these issues. Through the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign and 
Drug-Free Communities Program, we are working to ensure that young 
people understand the serious risks and consequences of substance abuse. 
And in order to help kids who need help, my Administration supports 
random drug testing as a prevention tool. We have also increased support 
for abstinence-only education programs, including grants for community 
and faith-based organizations, because abstinence is the only sure way 
to prevent teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
We all have an important role in giving America's children a healthy 
start in life by teaching them that the decisions they make today will 
affect them for the rest of their lives. By helping them make the right 
choices, we better prepare them for a hopeful future.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in 
October as ``Child Health Day'' and has requested the President to issue 
a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 4, 2004, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon families, schools, child health professionals, faith-
based and community organizations, and governments to help all our 
children discover the rewards of good health and wellness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-

United States of America and the Government of Israel (the ``FTA''), 
which the Congress approved in the United States-Israel Free Trade Area 
Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``FTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2112 Note).
2. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, 
on July 27, 2004, the Government of the United States entered into an 
agreement with the Government of Israel concerning certain aspects of 
trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, 
through December 31,

[[Page 94]]

2008 (the ``2004 Agreement''). The 2004 Agreement reflects an effort by 
the United States and Israel to address, through 2008, their continuing 
differences over the meaning of certain provisions in the FTA governing 
access for United States agricultural products to Israel's market.
3. Section 4(b) of the FTA Act provides that, whenever the President 
determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of 
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel 
provided for by the FTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, 
suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such 
continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such 
additional duties as the President determines to be required or 
appropriate to carry out the FTA.
4. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the FTA Act, I have determined that it is 
necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and 
mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel, to provide 
through the close of December 31, 2008, access into the United States 
customs territory for specified quantities of certain agricultural 
products of Israel free of duty or certain fees or other import charges.
5. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2483) (the ``Trade 
Act'') authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including section 4 of the FTA Act and 
section 604 of the Trade Act, do hereby proclaim:
    (1) In order to implement aspects of the 2004 Agreement with the 
Government of Israel, concerning certain aspects of trade in 
agricultural products, the HTS is modified as provided in the Annex to 
this proclamation.
    (2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (3) The modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods that are the 
product of Israel and are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after January 1, 2004, and the tariff treatment set 
forth therein shall be effective as provided in such Annex through 
December 31, 2008.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7827 of October 6, 2004

German-American Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Generations of German immigrants and their descendents have helped build 
America and chart its course through history. On German-American Day, we 
recognize these proud citizens for their important contributions to 
America and honor the bond between two great nations.
German Americans have been part of America's history since its earliest 
days, beginning with the establishment of the Jamestown Colony in 1607 
and the arrival of German Quakers and Mennonite families in 1683. Many 
of these early settlers came to America seeking religious freedom and 
the chance to develop a community based on tolerance and respect for all 
people. During the westward expansion of the United States, many German 
families helped settle communities, found cities, and develop the 
agriculture industry. Over time, the core beliefs of these freedom-
loving individuals helped define the liberty and opportunity that our 
country represents. Their traditions of public debate and active 
citizenship influenced important social issues such as land reform, 
abolition, workers' rights, and women's suffrage.
This week, our Government is breaking ground for a new Embassy in 
historic Berlin, exemplifying America's support of a unified Germany. 
Sharing a common commitment to freedom, peace, and prosperity, the 
citizens of Germany and America can build a better future for the 
benefit of all nations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2004, as 
German-American Day, and I encourage all Americans to recognize the 
contributions of our citizens of German descent.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7828 of October 7, 2004

Leif Erikson Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 1,000 years ago, Leif Erikson led his crew on a journey across 
the Atlantic, becoming the first European known to have set foot on 
North American soil. Every October, we honor this courageous Viking 
explorer, his historic voyage, and the rich heritage of Nordic 
Americans.

[[Page 98]]

Immigrants from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden and their 
descendants have made great contributions to our Nation in the fields of 
business, politics, the arts, education, agriculture, and other areas. 
Nordic Americans have also made a significant mark on our country's 
society and culture, and have helped to establish and define America's 
most cherished principles. Their energy and spirit have inspired others, 
and their courage, skill, and determination have played an important 
role in the development of our country. Today, millions of people in the 
United States trace their origins to these Nordic countries, and their 
contributions to America make our country stronger and better.
On this day, we also recognize our longstanding ties to these nations 
that were home to the ancestors of many Americans. Together, we continue 
to work to advance prosperity, expand freedom, and increase stability 
and security in Europe and elsewhere in the world.
To honor Leif Erikson, the courageous son of Iceland and grandson of 
Norway, and to celebrate our citizens of Nordic-American heritage, the 
Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 
2, 1964, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim October 
9 of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2004, as Leif Erikson Day. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7829 of October 11, 2004

Columbus Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The journeys of Christopher Columbus are among the world's greatest 
stories of daring and discovery. His courage, optimism, and adventurous 
spirit altered the course of history. On Columbus Day, we celebrate this 
remarkable explorer and his contributions to the ``New World.''
In August 1492, Columbus left Spain and sailed into the unknown with the 
simplest of navigational equipment. The risks were great and the outcome 
uncertain. Yet, Columbus was committed to the cause of discovery, 
finding a more efficient trade route to the East and advancing European 
civilization.
Today, Columbus' voyages continue to stir our imagination and encourage 
us to explore new frontiers. His spirit of determination and discovery 
is a characteristic shared by the American people and is reflected 
throughout

[[Page 99]]

our history, from the Lewis and Clark Expedition to the Moon landing and 
our many scientific and technological advances.
Columbus Day is also a celebration of the many contributions that 
Italian Americans have made to our Nation. Every aspect of our culture, 
whether it be art or music, law or politics, reflects the influence of 
Italian Americans. On this day we also remain thankful for the strong 
ties between the United States and Italy and pay tribute to the 
courageous and selfless Italian forces who are helping to advance 
freedom alongside American and coalition troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In commemoration of Columbus' journey, the Congress, by joint resolution 
of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has 
requested that the President proclaim the second Monday of October of 
each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2004, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7830 of October 11, 2004

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The story of Revolutionary War hero Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski is 
one of bravery and sacrifice that helped to secure America's blessings 
of liberty. We remember General Pulaski for his skill in battle, his 
commitment to freedom, and his willingness to give his life for 
America's independence.
Born in Poland in 1745, Casimir Pulaski first gained distinction as a 
military hero while fighting to defend his native Poland. His reputation 
as a bold warrior and his dedication to the cause of liberty became 
known throughout Europe.
Pulaski met with Benjamin Franklin in Paris in 1777 and agreed to join 
the Americans in their fight for freedom. He quickly proved to be a 
gifted military leader and was commissioned as a Brigadier General. He 
became known as ``the Father of the American Cavalry,'' recruiting and 
training a special corps of American, Polish, Irish, French, and German 
troops who fought with great skill and success. During the siege of 
Savannah in 1779, General Pulaski was mortally wounded, leaving a legacy 
of heroism that continues to inspire people around the world.

[[Page 100]]

On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we honor a noble patriot committed to 
the cause of freedom, and we recognize the countless contributions 
Polish Americans have made to our Nation and our culture. We also 
celebrate the strong friendship between the United States and Poland, 
remembering our shared history and common values and honoring the 
sacrifices of Polish troops who have served bravely alongside American 
and coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2004, as 
General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to commemorate 
this occasion with appropriate programs and activities paying tribute to 
Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who defend freedom.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7831 of October 12, 2004

National School Lunch Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The National School Lunch Program has provided healthy, affordable 
lunches to our Nation's children for almost 60 years. The program now 
serves more than 28 million children each day, many of whom might not 
otherwise eat nutritious lunches. During National School Lunch Week, we 
recognize the program's contributions to the health, well-being, and 
education of our Nation's youth.
In addition to providing the good nutrition that helps young people 
succeed in school, healthy school lunches and after-school snacks can 
help alleviate childhood obesity and lower children's risk of developing 
health problems. The National School Lunch Program also shares 
information about healthy eating habits with children, families, and 
communities; works to provide our children with the best possible school 
meals; and offers technical training and assistance to school food-
service staff. To support this program and other important child 
nutrition programs, earlier this year I signed into law the Child 
Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004. This bill expands access 
to programs for children of Armed Services personnel, promotes healthy 
food choices, and makes it easier for parents to enroll their eligible 
children.
The National School Lunch Program has accomplished a great deal in 
providing children with nutritious meals, and we must continue working 
to ensure that every child is well-nourished, healthy, and active. While 
children who participate in the school lunch program consume more 
fruits, vegetables, milk, and protein than students who obtain lunch 
elsewhere, over 60 percent of our Nation's young people still eat more 
than the daily

[[Page 101]]

recommended serving of fat, and less than 20 percent eat the recommended 
daily servings of fruits and vegetables. To promote the right choices, 
the Department of Agriculture's HealthierUS School Challenge is 
encouraging schools and local communities to create an environment that 
supports healthy lifestyles for our Nation's children.
The success of the National School Lunch Program stems from the hard-
working Americans who plan, prepare, and serve meals to millions of 
children every day. In recognition of the contributions of the National 
School Lunch Program to the health, education, and well-being of 
America's children, the Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 
(Public Law 87-780), as amended, has designated the week beginning on 
the second Sunday of October of each year as ``National School Lunch 
Week'' and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in 
observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 10 through October 16, 2004, as 
National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join the 
dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch Program 
in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being of our 
Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7832 of October 15, 2004

National Mammography Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Approximately one in seven women in the United States will develop 
breast cancer over her lifetime. Mammograms are critical for early 
detection of breast cancer and remain the most effective screening tool 
available today. Many women who develop breast cancer have no history of 
the disease in their families, and except for growing older, most have 
no strong risk factors. Regular mammogram screening, along with a 
clinical breast exam by a medical professional, can help identify breast 
cancer in its earliest stages when it is most treatable. On National 
Mammography Day, we underscore the importance of this life-saving 
technology.
The National Cancer Institute and the United States Preventive Services 
Task Force recommend a mammogram every 1 to 2 years for women age 40 and 
over. Strict guidelines help to ensure that mammograms are administered 
with the lowest possible doses of radiation by the best-trained medical 
staff. Scientists continue to study ways to improve mammograms and other 
screening technologies, and this research promises to make screening 
even more accurate and further reduce the number of breast cancer 
deaths.
My Administration is committed to preventing, detecting, treating, and 
ultimately finding a cure for breast cancer. Through an early detection 
program

[[Page 102]]

at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we have devoted over 
$200 million for promoting mammography use and helping low-income women 
afford screening for breast and cervical cancer. In addition, the 
National Institutes of Health is conducting the largest trial ever of 
new, early-detection technologies to help doctors target breast cancer 
before symptoms occur.
My Administration will continue working to ensure that America's women 
have access to the best screening services available. I urge women, 
especially those 40 and over, to talk to their doctors about breast 
cancer screening and to encourage their friends and family to do the 
same. Together, we can help save lives and build a healthier future for 
all our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2004, as 
National Mammography Day. I call on all Americans to observe this day 
with appropriate programs and activities recognizing our health care 
professionals and researchers for their contributions in helping to 
detect and treat breast cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7833 of October 15, 2004

White Cane Safety Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

To help increase their mobility and assist them in their daily lives, 
many people who are blind or visually impaired use a white cane. On 
White Cane Safety Day, we celebrate the symbolism of this important tool 
and the enduring spirit of independence and determination shown by 
Americans who use it.
In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the first Presidential 
proclamation for White Cane Safety Day. He wrote that the observance 
would ``make our people more fully aware of the meaning of the white 
cane'' and help increase the safety and self-reliance of our citizens 
who are blind or visually impaired. Over the last four decades, our 
Nation has removed many barriers for these individuals, making it easier 
for them to find jobs, access public buildings, and live independently 
in their communities.
Today, we are working to ensure that all Americans with disabilities 
have the opportunity to live with dignity, work productively, and 
realize their full potential. Through the New Freedom Initiative, my 
Administration continues to build on the progress of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to further promote the full participation 
of people with disabilities in all areas of society. The Department of 
Justice's ADA Business Connection is helping create a better 
understanding of ADA requirements

[[Page 103]]

and promote dialogue between the business community and the disability 
community. And the Department of Justice's Project Civic Access is 
improving public facilities to ensure that people with disabilities are 
integrated into community life. Through the Ticket to Work program and 
the Work Incentives Improvement Act, we are making significant strides 
toward building an America where all individuals are recognized for 
their talents and creativity. These efforts will help provide Americans 
who are blind or visually impaired the opportunity to pursue their 
dreams and realize the promise of our great country.
The Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-628) approved on 
October 6, 1964, as amended, has designated October 15 of each year as 
``White Cane Safety Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2004, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon public officials, business leaders, educators, librarians, 
and all the people of the United States to join with me in ensuring that 
all the benefits and privileges of life in our Nation are available to 
individuals who are blind and visually impaired, and to observe this day 
with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of

Proclamation 7834 of October 18, 2004

National Character Counts Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Individuals have the power to do much good, and great societies are 
built by knowing the difference between right and wrong. People of 
character strengthen our country through their daily actions. To help 
children fulfill their potential and build a more hopeful future for our 
Nation, we must continue to encourage and support the character 
development of our young people and support the institutions that give 
direction and purpose: our families, our schools, and our faith-based 
and community organizations.
Americans of all ages continue to inspire others with their compassion 
and decency by giving their time to faith-based and community 
organizations and bringing hope to others at home and around the world. 
The Senior Corps has more than 500,000 caring souls serving in its 
programs; the Peace Corps has grown to its highest number of volunteers 
in 28 years; and AmeriCorps will grow by 50 percent to 75,000 members 
this year. Almost two million students volunteer each year through the 
Learn and Serve America programs, which incorporate community service as 
a vital part of education. In addition, more than 1,300 communities have 
formed Citizen Corps Councils; over 10,000 communities have registered 
Neighborhood Watch programs; more than 27,000 Americans are serving in 
the Medical

[[Page 104]]

Reserve Corps; over 52,000 citizens have completed Community Emergency 
Response Team training; and there are more than 68,000 volunteers in the 
Volunteers in Police Service program. The true strength of America lies 
in the hearts and souls of its citizens, and these volunteers are making 
our country better and stronger.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 17 through October 
23, 2004, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public 
officials, educators, librarians, parents, students, and all Americans 
to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

Proclamation 7835 of October 20, 2004

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans with disabilities are active and contributing members of our 
society, and they must have the opportunity to develop the skills they 
need to compete and obtain jobs in the 21st century workforce. By 
reducing physical barriers and false perceptions, our country meets our 
commitment to millions of Americans with disabilities, and benefits from 
their talents, creativity, and hard work.
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) has brought about 
important progress in our Nation. Under my Administration's New Freedom 
Initiative, we continue to work to ensure that people with disabilities 
can participate fully in the workplace and all aspects of community 
life. Through funding for new technologies and innovative resources, we 
are changing old ways of thinking and fulfilling the Federal 
Government's commitment to opportunity for every citizen.
The New Freedom Initiative has helped enable individuals with 
disabilities to access assistive technologies. My Administration has 
invested in research and development for new technology. We have 
expanded the Department of Defense's Computer/Electronic Accommodations 
Program, which provides Federal employees with disabilities greater 
access to electronic and information technology. The Department of Labor 
launched DisabilityInfo.gov in 2002, an online resource that streamlines 
access to information about Federally sponsored employment, job 
accommodations, transportation, State and regional assistance programs, 
technology, and other programs relevant to the daily lives of 
individuals with disabilities.
We must foster a better understanding of ADA requirements and increase 
dialogue and cooperation between the business and disability 
communities. Through the New Freedom Small Business Initiative, the 
Department of

[[Page 105]]

Labor and the Small Business Administration are educating small business 
owners about the benefits of hiring people with disabilities and helping 
adult workers with disabilities acquire the skills and resources needed 
to become small business owners. The Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission is releasing user-friendly information on how the ADA applies 
to particular disabilities in the workplace and providing free ADA 
workshops offering employment-related services and information sessions 
for small businesses. My Administration is implementing the ``Ticket to 
Work'' program, which allows Social Security and Supplemental Security 
Income disability beneficiaries who want to work to choose their own 
employment-related services. The Department of Labor and other agencies 
are also improving the capacity of community One-Stop Career Centers to 
provide training and employment services to people with disabilities.
To recognize the contributions of Americans with disabilities and to 
encourage all citizens to ensure equal opportunity in the workforce, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved August 11, 1945, as amended (36 
U.S.C. 121), has designated October of each year as ``National 
Disability Employment Awareness Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 2004 as National Disability 
Employment Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, labor 
leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Proclamation 7836 of October 20, 2004

National Forest Products Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's forests are places of beauty and incredible natural wealth. 
They are homes to wildlife and offer many economic opportunities for our 
Nation. During National Forest Products Week, we recognize the many 
benefits of our forests and continue our dedication to protecting them.
Across our country, many communities rely on healthy forests for 
economic stability. Our forests provide paper products, building 
materials, chemicals, and many other items needed by families and small 
businesses across America. Responsible forest management helps provide 
jobs and maintain these important resources to help meet the daily needs 
of Americans and people around the world.
My Administration has made forest health a high priority, and we will 
continue to promote active management and forest conservation. Under the 
Healthy Forests Initiative, we acted to remove the causes of severe 
wildfires by thinning forest undergrowth before disaster strikes. And 
the Healthy

[[Page 106]]

Forests Restoration Act of 2003, which I signed into law last December, 
expands our work, helping protect valuable lands that serve as habitat 
for wildlife and ensuring the safety and economic vitality of 
communities affected by wildfires. The Act enforces high standards of 
conservation to help return our forests to more natural conditions and 
maintain the full range of forest types.
To ensure that our forests remain a source of pride for all Americans, 
we must continue our tradition of protecting the land for future 
generations. By combining the ethic of good stewardship with the spirit 
of innovation, we can advance a healthy environment and continue 
economic growth and job creation.
In recognizing the importance of our forests, the Congress, by Public 
Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week 
beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as ``National 
Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 17 through October 23, 2004, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 7837 of October 24, 2004

United Nations Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On United Nations Day, we commemorate the founding of the United Nations 
in 1945 and recognize its many contributions to advancing peace and 
human rights around the world.
Our Declaration of Independence and the United Nations' Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of 
every human life. That dignity is honored by the rule of law, limits on 
the power of the state, respect for women, protection of private 
property, free speech, equal justice, and religious tolerance. These 
founding documents affirm that the bright line between justice and 
injustice is the same in every age, every culture, and every nation.
Today, the United Nations is helping advance these ideals in many places 
around the globe. The U.N. assisted Afghanistan in making history when 
Afghan women and men voted in a democratic Presidential election earlier 
this month. In Sudan, Liberia, Haiti, and other nations, the U.N. has 
been working to bring security, stability, and humanitarian assistance 
to people in need. From Africa to the Caribbean to Asia, the U.N. is 
helping to turn

[[Page 107]]

societies away from old conflicts, overcome persistent poverty, and 
fight HIV/AIDS and other diseases.
The United States remains committed to the high ideals of the U.N. as 
stated in its charter: ``To save succeeding generations from the scourge 
of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . and to 
promote social progress and better standards of life in larger 
freedom.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2004, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor 
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas 
under the flag of the United States to honor the observance of United 
Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day

Proclamation 7838 of November 4, 2004

National Adoption Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

By deciding to share their hearts and homes with a child, adoptive 
parents demonstrate great compassion and receive many blessings in 
return. During National Adoption Month, we recognize the generosity of 
adoptive and foster families who are providing hope and love, and we 
encourage the adoption of children of all ages.
In 2002, I signed the Promoting Safe and Stable Families legislation 
that supports families and promotes adoption, and last December I signed 
the Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 to increase incentives to adopt older 
children. We have raised the adoption tax credit to $10,000 per child 
and created the AdoptUSKids website that has joined thousands of 
children with adoptive parents. We are working hard to place more 
children from foster care to permanent homes. This year, on November 20, 
communities from all 50 States and the District of Columbia will 
celebrate National Adoption Day by finalizing the adoption of thousands 
of children by loving families. And each one of those families will be 
enriched by the addition of new members. By bringing care and hope into 
other lives, individuals can fill their own lives with greater purpose.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2004 as National 
Adoption Month. I call on all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities to honor adoptive families and to 
participate in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.

Proclamation 7839 of November 4, 2004

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, it is estimated that over 4 million Americans suffer from 
Alzheimer's disease. A progressive, degenerative disorder of the brain, 
Alzheimer's robs individuals of their memory and their mental and 
physical functions, leading to increasing dependence on others for care. 
Factors such as age and family history can contribute to the risk of 
developing this disease. While no cure exists yet, researchers are 
learning more about this disease and how to enhance the quality of life 
for those with Alzheimer's.
President Reagan believed in the courage and capacity of the American 
people to overcome any obstacle, and my Administration remains committed 
to funding medical research programs to find a cure for Alzheimer's 
disease and improving care for Alzheimer's patients and increasing 
support for their families. The National Institutes of Health plans to 
spend $680 million in Alzheimer's research in 2004 and an estimated $699 
million in 2005, a 33 percent increase from 2001. The National 
Institutes of Health, along with the Department of Veterans Affairs, is 
testing drugs for prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This 
year, the National Institute on Aging launched the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative, an innovative partnership with the private 
sector that is using the latest technologies to observe changes in the 
brains of individuals who are affected by Alzheimer's. This project is 
researching ways to enhance early diagnosis and further the development 
of treatments. In addition, the Administration on Aging is working with 
States to improve home and community-based services for people with 
dementia and their families.
As we observe National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we recognize 
our citizens who are living with this disease and extend our gratitude 
to those who provide vital care and support. We also specially recognize 
the public and private scientists, researchers, nurses, and health care 
providers who are dedicated to finding new and better ways to help 
patients and ultimately find a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Their 
efforts bring comfort to many and offer hope for the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2004 as National 
Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.

Proclamation 7840 of November 4, 2004

National American Indian Heritage Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As the first people to call our country home, American Indians and 
Alaska Natives have a noble history in this land and have long shaped 
our Nation. During National American Indian Heritage Month, we celebrate 
our commitment to respect and preserve the rich Native American 
traditions and cultures.
The enduring experiences of tribal communities are a cherished part of 
our national story. In September, I was proud to meet with tribal 
leaders and celebrate the opening of the Smithsonian Institution's 
National Museum of the American Indian on the National Mall in 
Washington, D.C. This new facility stands as a powerful symbol of the 
pride and vitality of our Native Peoples. The museum showcases 
masterworks of great cultural, historical, and spiritual significance. 
Through exhibits documenting past and present achievements and hopes for 
the future, it will introduce generations of visitors to the strong and 
living traditions of Native Americans. As a center for scholarship and 
learning, the National Museum of the American Indian will also advance 
understanding of the diversity that makes our Nation great.
My Administration is committed to helping Native Americans as they build 
on their proud legacy. With the funding of my 2005 budget, we will have 
provided the Bureau of Indian Affairs with more than $1.1 billion for 
school construction and repairs during the past 4 years. To improve 
education for American Indian and Alaska Native children, I signed an 
executive order establishing an Interagency Working Group to help 
students meet the standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 
in a manner that is consistent with tribal traditions, languages, and 
cultures. By setting standards for academic achievement and cultural 
learning, Americans in all communities can help their children realize a 
brighter future. I also signed an executive memorandum to all Federal 
agencies affirming the Federal Government's continuing commitment to 
recognize tribal sovereignty and self-determination. As they have in the 
past, tribal governments will maintain jurisdiction over their lands, 
systems of self-governance, and government-to-government relationships 
with the United States.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2004 as National 
American Indian Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to commemorate 
this month with appropriate programs and activities and to learn more 
about the rich heritage of American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Proclamation 7841 of November 4, 2004

National Diabetes Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 18 million Americans are estimated to have diabetes. Diabetes 
is the leading cause of new blindness, end-stage kidney disease, and 
nontraumatic amputations. It can also double a person's risk of heart 
attack and stroke and can cause nervous system damage and premature 
death. During National Diabetes Month, we seek to raise awareness of the 
impact of diabetes on our citizens, and we recognize those committed to 
improving the treatment and prevention of this chronic disease.
Approximately one million Americans have been diagnosed with type 1 
diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes. It develops from autoimmune, 
genetic, and environmental influences, most often striking children, 
adolescents, and young adults. By developing the disease so young, 
people with type 1 diabetes have a greater risk for serious 
complications. Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 17 million 
Americans, and is most common in people over 40 who are overweight, 
inactive, or have a family history of this disease. While people of all 
backgrounds are affected, type 2 diabetes disproportionately strikes 
African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Native 
Americans. The number of Americans with type 2 diabetes has grown 
dramatically, and many more Americans are at high risk for developing 
it.
My Administration is committed to funding diabetes research. This year, 
the National Institutes of Health dedicated $993 million for diabetes 
research, and I have requested more that $1 billion for 2005, a 49 
percent increase since 2001.
We are also working to raise awareness of the risk factors associated 
with diabetes. According to clinical research, people at risk for type 2 
diabetes can reduce their risk by approximately 58 percent if they lose 
a modest amount of weight and stay physically active. Those who already 
live with diabetes can greatly reduce their risk for heart disease and 
stroke by controlling their blood sugar, blood pressure, and 
cholesterol.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2004 as National 
Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 7842 of November 4, 2004

National Family Caregivers Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, family caregivers across our Nation are caring for loved ones 
who are aging, chronically ill, or disabled. Through their selfless 
actions, they bring comfort to those in need, enrich their own lives, 
and reflect the true spirit of America.
America is a country of hope and promise that honors the dignity of all 
its citizens. Our family caregivers sometimes sacrifice their own 
emotional and physical needs to dedicate their time and energy to 
serving their loved ones. By taking on this enormous responsibility, 
they are helping honor life in all its seasons.
My Administration remains committed to supporting the important 
contributions of family caregivers. My fiscal year 2005 budget includes 
tax relief for Americans who need long-term care and individuals who 
care for these family members in their homes. We will also continue to 
work with employers, faith-based and community organizations, 
universities, and national aging organizations to bring critical 
services such as individual counseling, educational activities, respite 
care, and family leave policies to more Americans.
By bringing loving support to their loved ones, our Nation's family 
caregivers make our country a better place. During National Family 
Caregivers Month, we honor their generosity and dedication, and we 
recognize the vital role of family in the lives of our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2004 as National 
Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to honor and support 
the family members, friends, and neighbors who provide care to their 
loved ones in need.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the

Proclamation 7843 of November 4, 2004

National Hospice Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Hospice programs are a vital part of our Nation's health care system. 
They provide comfort, peace, and dignity for individuals in the final 
stage of life and their families. During National Hospice Month, we 
recognize the dedicated professionals and volunteers who provide hospice 
care, and we emphasize the importance of respecting and honoring life in 
all of its seasons.
For many terminally ill patients, hospice care is a compassionate 
alternative to traditional care at a hospital or nursing home. Hospice 
physicians, nurses, counselors, and volunteers focus on making patients 
as comfortable as possible, while allowing patients to remain at home 
and close to their families. With comprehensive assistance, these 
caregivers help control pain and other symptoms and provide emotional 
and spiritual support to both patient and family. In 2002, according to 
the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, an estimated 
885,000 individuals were admitted to one of the over 3,000 hospice 
programs in the United States.
My Administration has acted to strengthen and modernize Medicare for our 
seniors, and we remain committed to providing a health care system that 
meets the needs of every patient. Hospice services are covered by 
Medicare, and many States offer hospice care under their Medicaid 
programs. The Medicare legislation that I signed into law last December 
provides that Medicare will, for the first time, cover hospice 
consultation services so that terminally ill patients and their families 
will better understand end-of-life issues and care options. The 
legislation also makes the program more flexible and responsive to the 
needs of patients, allows patients to designate a nurse practitioner to 
coordinate their hospice care, and directs the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services to explore ways to make hospice care more widely 
available to beneficiaries who live in rural areas.
Americans believe in the worth and dignity of every person, and we are 
promoting a culture of life in our Nation. By caring for life at every 
stage, we can create a more compassionate and merciful world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2004 as National 
Hospice Month. I encourage all our citizens to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities. I also ask Americans to recognize 
our health care professionals and volunteers for their contributions to 
helping those facing terminal illness receive quality care.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7844 of November 9, 2004

Veterans Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans live in freedom because of our veterans' courage, dedication 
to duty, and love of country. On Veterans Day, we honor these brave men 
and women who have served in our Armed Forces and defended our Nation.
Across America, there are more than 25 million veterans. Their ranks 
include generations of citizens who have risked their lives while 
serving in military conflicts, including World War II, Korea, Vietnam, 
the Persian Gulf, and the war on terror. They have fought for the 
security of our country and the peace of the world. They have defended 
our founding ideals, protected the innocent, and liberated the oppressed 
from tyranny and terror. They have known the hardships and the fears and 
the tragic losses of war. Our veterans know that in the harshest hours 
of conflict they serve just and honorable purposes.
Through the years, our veterans have returned home from their duties to 
become active and responsible citizens in their communities, further 
contributing to the growth and development of our Nation. Their 
commitment to service inspires all Americans.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service men 
and women have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2004, as Veterans Day and urge 
all Americans to observe November 7 through November 13, 2004, as 
National Veterans Awareness Week. I urge all Americans to recognize the 
valor and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers. I 
call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the 
United States and to encourage and participate in patriotic activities 
in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places 
of worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this 
national observance with commemorative expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of

World Freedom Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Fifteen years ago, the people of East and West Germany tore down the 
Berlin Wall, and freedom triumphed over Communism. The dismantling of 
the Berlin Wall reunited Germany and helped spread freedom across 
Central and Eastern Europe. With free elections and the spread of 
democratic values, these countries won their liberty, and their people 
became free. These democracies today contribute to a strong Europe, and 
the United States values their friendship and their partnership.
On World Freedom Day, we recognize all of those who fought for liberty 
and helped end the oppression of Central and Eastern Europe. We stand by 
those who today are enjoying the blessings of liberty. And we reaffirm 
our commitment to extending peace and freedom in the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2004, as World 
Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to reaffirm their 
dedication to freedom and democracy.

America Recycles Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation is dedicated to good stewardship of our natural resources. On 
America Recycles Day, we reaffirm our commitment to preserving our 
resources and recycling.
Our country produces more than 200 million tons of municipal solid 
waste--approximately 4 pounds of waste per person per day. As more 
garbage is generated, the demands on our landfills, natural resources, 
and environment continue to grow. Recycling helps conserve energy and 
natural resources, provides raw materials for key domestic industries, 
reduces air and water pollution, cuts greenhouse gas emissions, and 
promotes the development of cleaner technologies. Recycling and 
composting diverts millions of tons of material away from landfills and 
incinerators. Through curbside collection and recyclable drop-off 
centers, communities across our

[[Page 115]]

Nation are demonstrating their commitment to protecting our environment 
and to building a better future for our next generation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

Proclamation 7847 of November 19, 2004

National Farm-City Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's farmers and ranchers provide a healthy, safe, and abundant 
food supply for our Nation and for people around the world. Their work 
depends on partnerships with shippers, processors, marketers, retailers, 
transporters, and many others, and their success is essential to 
America's prosperity. During National Farm-City Week, we recognize the 
importance of this cooperative network and the hard work and valuable 
contributions of those in our agricultural industry.
As one of our first industries, farming has long been vital to our 
Nation. Nearly half of the land in the United States is used for 
agricultural production, employing millions of workers, and providing 
consumers with food, clothing, and energy. In addition, America's 
farmers and ranchers are stewards of our land, using innovative 
conservation measures to protect our soil, water, and wildlife habitat.
Our cities also play a key role in our farm economy. Many of the 
industries that process, transport, and distribute agricultural goods 
are located in America's urban communities. Their work has contributed 
to record exports of farm products and to the prosperity of our Nation's 
agricultural industry.
My Administration will continue to work to strengthen American 
agriculture. As we observe National Farm-City Week, I join all our 
citizens in expressing gratitude to farmers, ranchers, and all those who 
work in our agricultural industry for their love of the land and love of 
our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 19 through 
November 25, 2004, as National Farm-City Week. I encourage all Americans 
to celebrate the cooperation between urban and rural communities and the

[[Page 116]]

extraordinary contributions of the agricultural industry to our Nation's 
vitality and prosperity.

Proclamation 7848 of November 23, 2004

National Family Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Strong families are the foundation of our society. They provide 
stability for our citizens and instill responsibility and values in our 
children. During National Family Week, we underscore our commitment to 
supporting families and recognize the significance of family to our 
country.
Families have an important role in teaching our Nation's young people to 
understand the consequences of their actions and to recognize that the 
decisions they make today could affect the rest of their lives. In times 
of change, the family values of compassion, reverence, and integrity 
serve as steady guides. My Administration is standing with American 
families because children should have the opportunity to grow up in a 
stable home.
To help families, I was proud last month to sign the Working Families 
Tax Relief Act of 2004. Because of this legislation, more than 90 
million Americans will have a lower tax bill next year. With more of 
their own money, parents can save for retirement or a child's education, 
or invest in a home or small business. For many American families, the 
most valuable commodity is extra time. I have called on the Congress to 
give individuals the voluntary options of comp-time and flex-time as an 
alternative to overtime pay so that they may better juggle the demands 
of work and family.
As we celebrate family this week, our Nation expresses its gratitude for 
the families whose loved ones serve in our Armed Forces. These brave 
military men and women are working to defend our country and spread 
freedom so that all Americans are safe and secure. We pray for them and 
for their families. And we will always remember the courage and selfless 
commitment of those who have paid the ultimate price for our security 
and freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21 through 
November 27, 2004, as National Family Week. I invite the States, 
communities, and all the people of the United States to join together in 
observing this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor 
our Nation's families.

Proclamation 7849 of November 23, 2004

Thanksgiving Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

All across America, we gather this week with the people we love to give 
thanks to God for the blessings in our lives. We are grateful for our 
freedom, grateful for our families and friends, and grateful for the 
many gifts of America. On Thanksgiving Day, we acknowledge that all of 
these things, and life itself, come from the Almighty God.
Almost four centuries ago, the Pilgrims celebrated a harvest feast to 
thank God after suffering through a brutal winter. President George 
Washington proclaimed the first National Day of Thanksgiving in 1789, 
and President Lincoln revived the tradition during the Civil War, asking 
Americans to give thanks with ``one heart and one voice.'' Since then, 
in times of war and in times of peace, Americans have gathered with 
family and friends and given thanks to God for our blessings.
Thanksgiving is also a time to share our blessings with those who are 
less fortunate. Americans this week will gather food and clothing for 
neighbors in need. Many young people will give part of their holiday to 
volunteer at homeless shelters and food pantries. On Thanksgiving, we 
remember that the true strength of America lies in the hearts and souls 
of the American people. By seeking out those who are hurting and by 
lending a hand, Americans touch the lives of their fellow citizens and 
help make our Nation and the world a better place.
This Thanksgiving, we express our gratitude to our dedicated 
firefighters and police officers who help keep our homeland safe. We are 
grateful to the homeland security and intelligence personnel who spend 
long hours on faithful watch. And we give thanks for the Americans in 
our Armed Forces who are serving around the world to secure our country 
and advance the cause of freedom. These brave men and women make our 
entire Nation proud, and we thank them and their families for their 
sacrifice.
On this Thanksgiving Day, we thank God for His blessings and ask Him to 
continue to guide and watch over our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 25, 
2004, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all Americans to 
gather together in their homes and places of worship to reinforce the 
ties of family and community and to express gratitude for the many 
blessings we enjoy.

Proclamation 7850 of December 1, 2004

World AIDS Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

HIV/AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time. Its defeat requires 
the cooperation of the entire global community. On World AIDS Day, 
people around the world unite to demonstrate our commitment to fighting 
HIV/AIDS and to offer prayers and support for those living with HIV/AIDS 
and for their families and caregivers.
America and many nations have great opportunities to improve health, 
expand prosperity, and extend freedom in our time. My Administration has 
made turning the tide against HIV/AIDS a priority. In my 2003 State of 
the Union Address, I was proud to announce the Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief. This plan commits $15 billion over 5 years to fight the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic in over 100 countries throughout the world, focusing on 15 of 
the hardest-hit countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia. These 
funds are already at work and will help prevent 7 million new 
infections, treat 2 million infected individuals, and care for 10 
million individuals, including orphans and vulnerable children infected 
or affected by this disease.
This year, we also recognize the challenges HIV/AIDS poses to women. 
Through the Emergency Plan, the United States supports drug therapy and 
counseling to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. In 
addition, we are working to prevent girls from becoming infected through 
sexual coercion or exploitation and to increase support and services to 
help reduce the burden on women who are called upon to care for a sick 
loved one.
In order to defeat this pandemic, we also must discover new treatments 
and cures. America joined with other countries at the G-8 Summit in June 
to announce the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, a major commitment from 
the world's leading scientists to find ways to combat this devastating 
disease. My Administration also supports efforts to encourage testing 
because in the United States alone, one-quarter of those infected with 
HIV each year do not know that they are infected. And, because 
abstinence is the only sure way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases, 
my Administration has more than tripled funding for abstinence-only 
programs since taking office.
Our country and other nations around the world are working to bring new 
hope to those suffering with HIV/AIDS and contribute to a healthier 
future for people around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 119]]

laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2004, as World 
AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
remembering those who have lost their lives to this disease and to 
comfort and support those living with and affected by HIV/AIDS.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7851 of December 2, 2004

National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we have made great strides in reducing the deadly cost of 
impaired driving, but driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs 
still shatters too many lives and robs too many people of their 
potential. During National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 
we continue our work to end impaired driving and urge all Americans to 
be responsible and safe drivers this holiday season and throughout the 
year.
My Administration is committed to saving lives and preventing injuries 
resulting from alcohol- and drug-impaired driving. The NHTSA sponsors 
public education programs such as the ``You Drink & Drive. You Lose.'' 
campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk and drugged 
driving, and works with State and local law enforcement agencies as they 
conduct sobriety checkpoints and saturation patrols. In addition, the 
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign has invested millions of dollars 
to educate Americans about the threat posed by illegal drugs and drugged 
driving. We are also increasing resources for State enforcement and 
education programs. My Administration awarded $80.6 million in grants 
this year to States that have lowered the legal threshold for impaired 
driving to .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC). As of this year, all 
50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
have adopted this legal definition of impaired driving.
Individuals across our country can help prevent drunk and drugged 
driving by encouraging responsible actions, identifying sober designated 
drivers, and educating young people about safe, substance-free driving 
behavior. Working together, all Americans can make our roads safer and 
save lives by preventing drunk and drugged driving.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2004 as National 
Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month.

Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7852 of December 6, 2004

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On a quiet Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, more than 2,400 Americans 
were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor. On that day, life changed in 
America, and the course of history was altered forever.
Our citizens reacted to the attack with firm determination to defeat 
tyranny and secure our Nation. This enterprise required the commitment 
and effort of our entire country. At the height of the conflict, the 
United States had ships on every ocean and troops on five continents. In 
all, more than 16 million Americans wore the uniform of our Nation. They 
came from all walks of life. They served honorably and fought fiercely. 
At home, millions more contributed to the war effort, laboring for 
victory in our factories, on farms, and across America.
Today, we honor those who fought and died at Pearl Harbor, and we pay 
special tribute to the veterans of World War II. These heroes hold a 
cherished place in our history. Through their courage, sacrifice, and 
selfless dedication, they saved our country and preserved freedom. As we 
fight the war on terror, their patriotism continues to inspire a new 
generation of Americans who have been called to defend the blessings of 
liberty. Like those who have gone before them throughout our history, 
our troops fighting the war on terror are defending America from danger 
and liberating the oppressed.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2004, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn 
occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal 
agencies, interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the 
flag of the United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of 
those who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7854 of December 10, 2004

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we 
celebrate the founding ideals of our Nation and emphasize the importance 
of protecting human liberty throughout the world.
As a Nation, we cherish the values of free speech, equality, and 
religious freedom, and we steadfastly oppose injustice and tyranny. 
Since the founding of America, the Bill of Rights has protected basic 
human rights and liberties. In the United States, all citizens have the 
opportunity to voice their opinions, practice their faith, and enjoy the 
blessings of freedom.
After the tragedies of World War II, the United Nations General Assembly 
adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as part of a global 
effort to curb the cruelty and systematic injustice that had destroyed 
so many lives. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the 
inalienable rights of people everywhere.
In the time since, progress has been made in ensuring that human dignity 
is respected, and we have witnessed the rise of democratic governments 
around the world. No other system of government has done more to protect 
minorities, secure the rights of labor, raise the status of women, or 
channel human energy to the pursuits of peace than democracy.
My Administration continues to encourage free and open societies around 
the world. In Burma, we have called on the ruling junta to release Aung 
San Suu Kyi and engage in dialogue to bring democracy to that country. 
We are helping lead the international effort to end the suffering in 
Sudan. We seek to help the people of North Korea, who are struggling to 
survive under severe repression and difficult living conditions, and our 
Nation continues to stand with those who strive for democracy in 
Belarus, Cuba, Iran, and Zimbabwe.
My Administration also has advanced the fight against human trafficking 
and the abuse and exploitation of women and children, particularly of 
young girls in the sex trade. In addition, we have expanded our Nation's

[[Page 123]]

support for democracy promotion programs globally and have increased the 
budget for the National Endowment for Democracy to strengthen support 
for free elections, free markets, free speech, and human rights advocacy 
around the world.
Freedom and dignity are God's gift to each man and woman in the world. 
During this observance, we encourage all nations to continue working 
towards freedom, peace, and security, which can be achieved only through 
democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2004, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 2004, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 2004, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to honor the legacy of human rights passed 
down to us from previous generations and to mark these observances with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7855 of December 15, 2004

60th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty years ago, more than 600,000 American soldiers fought at the 
Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes Forest region of Belgium and 
Luxembourg. What began as a German surprise attack on December 16, 1944, 
became the largest land battle involving U.S. troops in World War II and 
ended with an Allied victory on January 25, 1945. By the end of the 
battle, there were 81,000 American casualties, including approximately 
19,000 who had sacrificed their lives. This formidable stand was a 
turning point in the war and was critical to the defeat of Nazi Germany 
and the liberation of Europe from tyranny.
Americans continue to be inspired by the valor and integrity of those 
who fought and those who died at the Battle of the Bulge. We recognize 
these brave individuals and pay special tribute to all the veterans of 
World War II. When it mattered most, an entire generation of Americans 
showed the finest qualities of our Nation and humanity. Today, as we 
wage a war on terrorism and defend freedom, our service men and women 
follow and uphold this great tradition of achievement and courage. Just 
like their parents and grandparents, the men and women of this 
generation of our military have answered the call to help advance peace 
and democracy and keep the American people safe.

[[Page 124]]

On the 60th anniversary of one of the fiercest battles of World War II, 
our Nation honors the veterans who share with us the story of this epic 
struggle and all of the brave Americans who fought in the Battle of the 
Bulge.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby urge all Americans to observe the 
60th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. I call upon all Americans 
to observe this occasion with appropriate activities, ceremonies, and 
programs designed to honor those who served and sacrificed to liberate 
Europe and defend America's freedom and security.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7856 of December 17, 2004

Wright Brothers Day, 2004

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Wright Brothers Day, we honor the achievement and imagination of 
Orville and Wilbur Wright, two bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio, who 
changed the world with their optimism, creativity, and persistence. On 
this day, we recall a monumental event in the history of our Nation and 
in the story of mankind.
On a cold December morning in 1903 on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, 
a small wood and canvas aircraft sent America on a journey far beyond 
the sands of Kitty Hawk. The flight spanned 120 feet and lasted just 12 
seconds, yet it ushered in a new era of unimaginable advances in 
aviation and aerospace technology. Today, air travel is vital to our 
country, helping bring people together and sustain our security. In 
addition, the aviation industry strengthens our economy by supporting 
millions of jobs.
The spirit that led the Wright Brothers to powered flight continues 
today in America's space program. From providing surveys of the sun to 
images of the planets, our spacecraft are exploring the outer edges of 
our solar system and revolutionizing our view of the universe. Under my 
Vision for Space Exploration Program, we will proudly carry on the 
Wright Brothers' tradition of innovation. As we embark on the next 
century of flight, that spirit of discovery will help our Nation and the 
world realize the full promise of tomorrow.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963 (77 Stat. 
402; 36 U.S.C. 143) as amended, has designated December 17 of each year 
as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested the 
President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the 
United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.

[[Page 125]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2004, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7857 of December 20, 2004

To Implement the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On May 18, 2004, the United States entered into the United States-
Australia Free Trade Agreement (USAFTA). The USAFTA was approved by the 
Congress in section 101(a) of the United States-Australia Free Trade

118 Stat. 919) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note).
2. Section 105(a) of the USAFTA Act authorizes the President to 
establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office that 
shall be responsible for providing administrative assistance to panels 
established under Chapter 21 of the USAFTA.
3. Section 201 of the USAFTA Act authorizes the President to proclaim 
such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of 
duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the

respect to Australia set forth in Annex 2-B, of the USAFTA.
4. Section 203 of the USAFTA Act provides certain rules for determining 
whether a good is an originating good for the purpose of implementing 
preferential tariff treatment under the USAFTA. I have decided that it

5. Section 206 of the USAFTA Act authorizes the President to take 
certain enforcement actions relating to trade with Australia in textile 
and apparel goods.

Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) to 
supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements.

[[Page 126]]

8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting 
import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
sections 105(a), 201, 203, 206, and 321-328 of the USAFTA Act, section 
301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do 
proclaim that:
    (1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff 
treatment being accorded under the USAFTA, to set forth rules for 
determining whether goods imported into the customs territory of the 
United States are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the 
USAFTA, to provide certain other treatment to originating goods for the 
purposes of the USAFTA, and to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect 
to certain originating goods, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex 
I of Publication No. 3722 of the United States International Trade 
Commission, entitled Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States Implementing the United States-Australia Free Trade 
Agreement (Publication 3722), which is incorporated by reference into 
this proclamation.
    (2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty elimination 
provided for in the USAFTA, to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect 
to certain originating goods, and to provide for future staged 
reductions in duties for originating products of Australia for purposes 
of the USAFTA, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex II of 
Publication 3722, effective on the dates specified in the relevant 
sections of such publication and on any subsequent dates set forth for 
such duty reductions in that publication.
    (3) The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to exercise the 
authority of the President under section 105(a) of the USAFTA Act to 
establish or designate an office within the Department of Commerce to 
carry out the functions set forth in that section.
    (4) (a) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of 
this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates 
indicated in Annex II to Publication 3722.

   (b) Except as provided in paragraph 4(a) of this proclamation, this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2005.

    (5) The CITA is authorized to exercise the authority of the

produce, goods are consistent with statements by the enterprise; to find 
that an enterprise has knowingly or willfully engaged in circumvention; 
and to deny preferential tariff treatment to textile and apparel goods.
    (6) The CITA is authorized to exercise the authority of the 
President under sections 321-328 of the USAFTA Act to review requests, 
including

[[Page 127]]

allegations of critical circumstances, and to determine whether to 
commence consideration of such requests; to cause to be published in the 
Federal Register a notice of commencement of consideration of a request 
and notice seeking public comment; to determine whether imports of an 
Australian textile or apparel article are causing serious damage, or 
actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing an article that 
is like, or directly competitive with, the imported article; and to 
provide relief from imports of an article that is the subject of such a 
determination; and if critical circumstances are alleged, to determine 
whether there is clear evidence that imports from Australia have 
increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs 
duty under the USAFTA, whether there is clear evidence that such imports 
are causing serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic 
industry producing an article that is like, or directly competitive 
with, the imported article, and whether delay in taking action would 
cause damage to that industry that would be difficult to repair; and to 
provide provisional relief with respect to imports that are subject to 
an affirmative determination of critical circumstances that is necessary 
to remedy or prevent the serious damage.
    (7) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7858 of December 21, 2004

To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. In Proclamation 7561 of May 16, 2002, I designated the Republic of 
Cote d'Ivoire as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country pursuant to 
section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, (the ``1974 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) 
(AGOA)). I also provided that Cote d'Ivoire would be considered a lesser 
developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of 
section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(B)).
2. In Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, President Clinton delegated 
to the United States Trade Representative (USTR) the authority to 
perform the function specified in section 113(b)(1)(B) of the AGOA (19 
U.S.C. 3722(b)(1)(B)). In a Federal Register notice dated December 17, 
2003, the USTR determined that Cote d'Ivoire had adopted an effective 
visa system and related procedures to prevent unlawful transshipment and 
the use of

[[Page 128]]

counterfeit documents and that Cote d'Ivoire had implemented and 
followed, or was making substantial progress toward implementing and 
following, certain customs procedures that assist the United States 
Customs Service in verifying the origin of the products.
3. Section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) authorizes 
the President to terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A if he 
determines that the country is not making continual progress in meeting 
the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, 
effective on January 1 of the year following the year in which such 
determination is made.
4. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that Cote d'Ivoire is not making continual progress in meeting the 
requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act. 
Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the designation of Cote 
d'Ivoire as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of 
section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on January 1, 2005.
5. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President 
to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) 
the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts 
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the 
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or 
other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including sections 506A and 604 of the 
1974 Act and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do proclaim 
that:
(1) The designation of Cote d'Ivoire as a beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act is 
terminated, effective on January 1, 2005.
(2) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning January 1, 2005, Cote 
d'Ivoire shall no longer be designated as a beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country, general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by deleting 
``Republic of Cote d'Ivoire'' from the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries. Further, U.S. note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 
98 is modified by removing ``Cote d'Ivoire'' from the list of lesser 
developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, and U.S. note 7(a) 
to subchapter II and U.S. note 1 to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the 
HTS are modified by deleting ``Cote d'Ivoire'' from the list of 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries eligible for certain textile 
and apparel benefits.
(3) The modification to the HTS made by this proclamation shall be 
effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after January 1, 2005.
(4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and executive orders that 
are inconsistent with this proclamation are superseded to the extent of 
such inconsistency.

Executive Order 13324 of January 15, 2004

Termination of Emergency With Respect to Sierra Leone and Liberia

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, including the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 5 of the United Nations 
Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c),
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that 
the situations that gave rise to the declaration of a national emergency 
in Executive Order 13194 of January 18, 2001, with respect to Sierra 
Leone and the expansion of the scope of that emergency in Executive 
Order 13213 of May 22, 2001, with respect to Liberia, have been 
significantly altered given that in January 2002 the Government of 
Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leonean rebel group Revolutionary United Front 
(RUF), and the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone declared the war 
in Sierra Leone to have ended; the parties to the Liberian civil war 
entered into a Comprehensive Peace Agreement in August 2003; the RUF no 
longer exists as a military organization; Charles Taylor, who was the 
prime instigator of violence both in Sierra Leone and in Liberia, has 
resigned from the Liberian presidency and gone into exile; the 
Government of Sierra Leone has established a rough diamond certification 
regime that meets the minimum standards of the Kimberley Process 
Certification Scheme; and the United States has implemented the Clean 
Diamond Trade Act (Public Law 108-19), prohibiting the importation into 
the United States of rough diamonds that are not controlled through the 
Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, currently including rough 
diamonds from Liberia. Accordingly, I hereby terminate the national

considers will best describe the nature, use, and extent of the real 
property holdings of the Federal Government.
    (d) The Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the 
Federal Real Property Council, may establish data and other information 
technology (IT) standards for use by Federal agencies in developing or

advising the President in the discharge of his constitutional authority 
under Article II of the Constitution to conduct foreign relations,

States, in order to ensure the most effective counterproliferation 
capabilities of the United States and response to the September 11, 
2001, terrorist attacks and the ongoing threat of terrorist activity. 
The Commission shall assess whether the Intelligence Community is 
sufficiently authorized, organized, equipped, trained, and resourced to 
identify and warn in a timely manner of, and to support United States 
Government efforts to respond to, the development and transfer of 
knowledge, expertise, technologies, materials, and resources associated 
with the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, related means of 
delivery, and other related threats of the 21st Century and their 
employment by foreign powers (including terrorists, terrorist 
organizations, and private networks, or other entities or individuals). 
In doing so, the Commission shall examine the capabilities and 
challenges of the Intelligence Community to collect, process, analyze, 
produce, and disseminate information concerning the capabilities, 
intentions, and activities of such foreign powers relating to the 
design, development, manufacture, acquisition, possession, 
proliferation, transfer, testing, potential or threatened use, or use of

related threats of the 21st Century.
    (b) With respect to that portion of its examination under paragraph 
2(a) of this order that relates to Iraq, the Commission shall 
specifically examine the Intelligence Community's intelligence prior to 
the initiation of Operation Iraqi Freedom and compare it with the

possession, proliferation, transfer, testing, potential or threatened 
use, or use of Weapons of Mass Destruction and related means of

     compare the Intelligence Community's intelligence concerning

Executive Order 13330 of February 24, 2004

Human Service Transportation Coordination

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and to enhance access to 
transportation to improve mobility, employment opportunities, and access 
to community services for persons who are transportation-disadvantaged, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. This order is issued consistent with the following findings 
and principles:
    (a) A strong America depends on citizens who are productive and who 
actively participate in the life of their communities.
    (b) Transportation plays a critical role in providing access to 
employment, medical and health care, education, and other community 
services and amenities. The importance of this role is underscored by 
the variety of transportation programs that have been created in 
conjunction with health and human service programs, and by the 
significant Federal investment in accessible public transportation 
systems throughout the Nation.

[[Page 144]]

    (c) These transportation resources, however, are often difficult for 
citizens to understand and access, and are more costly than necessary 
due to inconsistent and unnecessary Federal and State program rules and 
restrictions.
    (d) A broad range of Federal program funding allows for the purchase 
or provision of transportation services and resources for persons who 
are transportation-disadvantaged. Yet, in too many communities, these 
services and resources are fragmented, unused, or altogether 
unavailable.
    (e) Federally assisted community transportation services should be 
seamless, comprehensive, and accessible to those who rely on them for 
their lives and livelihoods. For persons with mobility limitations 
related to advanced age, persons with disabilities, and persons 
struggling for self-sufficiency, transportation within and between our 
communities should be as available and affordable as possible.
    (f) The development, implementation, and maintenance of responsive, 
comprehensive, coordinated community transportation systems is essential 
for persons with disabilities, persons with low incomes, and older 
adults who rely on such transportation to fully participate in their 
communities.
Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) As used in this order, the term ``agency'' 
means an executive department or agency of the Federal Government.
    (b) For the purposes of this order, persons who are transportation-
disadvantaged are persons who qualify for Federally conducted or 
Federally assisted transportation-related programs or services due to 
disability, income, or advanced age.
Sec. 3. Establishment of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating 
Council on Access and Mobility. (a) There is hereby established, within 
the Department of Transportation for administrative purposes, the 
``Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council on Access and 
Mobility'' (``Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council'' or 
``Council''). The membership of the Interagency Transportation 
Coordinating Council shall consist of:
                                                                     (i)
     the Secretaries of Transportation, Health and Human Services, 
    Education, Labor, Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Housing and Urban 
    Development, and the Interior, the Attorney General, and the 
    Commissioner of Social Security; and
                                                                    (ii)
     such other Federal officials as the Chairperson of the Council may 
    designate.
    (b) The Secretary of Transportation, or the Secretary's designee, 
shall serve as the Chairperson of the Council. The Chairperson shall 
convene and preside at meetings of the Council, determine its agenda, 
direct its work, and, as appropriate to particular subject matters, 
establish and direct subgroups of the Council, which shall consist 
exclusively of the Council's members.
    (c) A member of the Council may designate any person who is part of 
the member's agency and who is an officer appointed by the President or 
a full-time employee serving in a position with pay equal to or greater 
than the minimum rate payable for GS-15 of the General Schedule to 
perform functions of the Council or its subgroups on the member's 
behalf.
Sec 4. Functions of the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council. 
The Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council shall:

[[Page 145]]

    (a) promote interagency cooperation and the establishment of 
appropriate mechanisms to minimize duplication and overlap of Federal 
programs and services so that transportation-disadvantaged persons have 
access to more transportation services;
    (b) facilitate access to the most appropriate, cost-effective 
transportation services within existing resources;
    (c) encourage enhanced customer access to the variety of 
transportation and resources available;
    (d) formulate and implement administrative, policy, and procedural 
mechanisms that enhance transportation services at all levels; and
    (e) develop and implement a method for monitoring progress on 
achieving the goals of this order.
Sec. 5. Report. In performing its functions, the Interagency 
Transportation Coordinating Council shall present to me a report not 
later than 1 calendar year from the date of this order. The report 
shall:
    (a) Identify those Federal, State, Tribal and local laws, 
regulations, procedures, and actions that have proven to be most useful 
and appropriate in coordinating transportation services for the targeted 
populations;
    (b) Identify substantive and procedural requirements of 
transportation-related Federal laws and regulations that are duplicative 
or restrict the laws' and regulations' most efficient operation;
    (c) Describe the results achieved, on an agency and program basis, 
in: (i) simplifying access to transportation services for persons with 
disabilities, persons with low income, and older adults; (ii) providing 
the most appropriate, cost-effective transportation services within 
existing resources; and (iii) reducing duplication to make funds 
available for more services to more such persons;
    (d) Provide recommendations to simplify and coordinate applicable 
substantive, procedural, and administrative requirements; and
    (e) Provide any other recommendations that would, in the judgment of 
the Council, advance the principles set forth in section 1 of this 
order.
Sec. 6. General. (a) Agencies shall assist the Interagency 
Transportation Coordinating Council and provide information to the 
Council consistent with applicable law as may be necessary to carry out 
its functions. To the extent permitted by law, and as permitted by 
available agency resources, the Department of Transportation shall 
provide funding and administrative support for the Council.
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.
    (c) This order is intended only to improve the internal management 
of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by a

[[Page 146]]

party against the United States, its departments, agencies, 
instrumentalities or entities, its officers or employees, or any other 
person.

and implementing policies governing programs authorized under the 
national service laws, the Corporation shall, to the extent permitted by 
law, adhere to the following fundamental principles:

Executive Order 13336 of April 30, 2004

American Indian and Alaska Native Education

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and to recognize the unique 
educational and culturally related academic needs of American Indian and 
Alaska Native students consistent with the unique political and legal 
relationship of the Federal Government with tribal governments, it is 
hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. The United States has a unique legal relationship 
with Indian tribes and a special relationship with Alaska Native 
entities as provided in the Constitution of the United States, treaties, 
and Federal statutes. This Administration is committed to continuing to 
work with these Federally recognized tribal governments on a government-
to-government basis, and supports tribal sovereignty and self-
determination. It is the purpose of this order to assist American Indian 
and Alaska Native students in meeting the challenging student academic 
standards of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) 
in a manner that is consistent with tribal traditions, languages, and 
cultures. This order builds on the innovations, reforms, and high 
standards of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, including: stronger 
accountability for results; greater flexibility in the use of Federal 
funds; more choices for parents; and an emphasis on research-based 
instruction that works.
Sec. 2. Interagency Working Group. There is established an Interagency 
Working Group on American Indian and Alaska Native Education (Working 
Group) to oversee the implementation of this order.
    (a) The Working Group's members shall consist exclusively of the 
heads of the executive branch departments, agencies, or offices listed 
below:

     the Department of Agriculture;
                                                                     (v)
     the Department of Justice;

agency, or office who is either an officer of the United States 
appointed by the President, or a full-time employee serving in a 
position with pay equal to or greater than the minimum rate payable for 
GS-15 of the General Schedule. The Working Group shall be led by the

section, who shall serve as Co-Chairs.

I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby 
determine that the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting

the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. To 
address that threat, and to implement the SAA, I hereby order the 
following:
Section 1. (a) The Secretary of State shall not permit the exportation 
or reexportation to Syria of any item on the United States Munitions

Sec. 2. The Secretary of Transportation shall not permit any air carrier 
owned or controlled by Syria to provide foreign air transportation as 
defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(23), except that he may, to the extent 
consistent with Department of Transportation regulations, permit such 
carriers to charter aircraft to the Government of Syria for the 
transport of Syrian government officials to and from the United States 
on official Syrian government business. In addition, the Secretary of 
Transportation shall prohibit all takeoffs and landings in the United 
States, other than those associated with an emergency, by any such air 
carrier when engaged in scheduled international air services.
Sec. 3. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), and 
(4) of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), and the Trade

     to be or to have been directing or otherwise significantly 
    contributing to the Government of Syria's provision of safe haven to 
    or other support for any person whose property or interests in 
    property are blocked under United States law for terrorism-related 
    reasons, including, but not limited to, Hamas, Hizballah, 
    Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
    Palestine, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General

     to be or to have been directing or otherwise significantly 
    contributing to the Government of Syria's military or security 
    presence in Lebanon;
                                                                   (iii)
     to be or to have been directing or otherwise significantly 
    contributing to the Government of Syria's pursuit of the development 
    and production of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons and 
    medium- and long-range surface-to-surface missiles;

receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services 
from any such person.
Sec. 4. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 
1702(b)(2)) would seriously impair the ability to deal with the national 
emergency declared in this order, and hereby prohibit, (i) the 
exportation or reexportation of such donated articles to Syria as 
provided in section 1(b) of this order; and (ii) the making of such 
donations by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to section 3 of this order.
Sec. 6. For purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;

citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;

[[Page 171]]

    (d) the term ``Government of Syria'' means the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled

    (e) the term ``product of the United States'' means: for the 
purposes of subsection 1(b), any item subject to the Export 
Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. parts 730-774); and for the 
purposes of subsection 1(c), any item subject to the export licensing 
jurisdiction of any other United States Government agency.
Sec. 7. With respect to the prohibitions contained in section 1 of this 
order, consistent with subsection 5(b) of the SAA, I hereby determine 
that it is in the national security interest of the United States to 
waive, and hereby waive application of subsection 5(a)(1) and subsection 
5(a)(2)(A) of the SAA so as to permit the exportation or reexportation 
of certain items as specified in the Department of Commerce's General 
Order No. 2 to Supplement No. 1, 15 C.F.R. part 736, as issued 
consistent with this order and as may be amended pursuant to the 
provisions of this order and in a manner consistent with the SAA. This 
waiver is made pursuant to the SAA only to the extent that regulation of 
such exports or reexports would not otherwise fall within my 
constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's foreign affairs and 
protect national security.
Sec. 8. With respect to the prohibitions contained in section 2 of this 
order, consistent with subsection 5(b) of the SAA, I hereby determine 
that it is in the national security interest of the United States to 
waive, and hereby waive, application of subsection 5(a)(2)(D) of the SAA 
insofar as it pertains to: aircraft of any air carrier owned or 
controlled by Syria chartered by the Syrian government for the transport 
of Syrian government officials to and from the United States on official 
Syrian government business, to the extent consistent with Department of 
Transportation regulations; takeoffs or landings for non-traffic stops 
of aircraft of any such air carrier that is not engaged in scheduled 
international air services; takeoffs and landings associated with an 
emergency; and overflights of United States territory.
Sec. 9. I hereby direct the Secretary of State to take such actions, 
including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as may be necessary 
to carry out subsection 1(a) of this order. I hereby direct the 
Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to 
take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, 
as may be necessary to carry out subsection 1(b) of this order. I direct 
the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and 
regulations, as may be necessary to carry out section 2 of this order. 
The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the 
promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted 
to the President by the IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out sections 
3, 4, and 5 of this order. The Secretaries of State, Commerce, 
Transportation, and the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions 
to other officers and agencies of the United States Government 
consistent with applicable law. The Secretary of State, in consultation 
with the Secretaries of Commerce, Transportation, and the Treasury, as 
appropriate, is authorized to exercise the functions and authorities 
conferred upon the President in subsection 5(b) of the SAA and to 
redelegate these functions and authorities consistent with applicable 
law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to 
take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the 
provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to

[[Page 172]]

advise the Secretaries of State, Commerce, Transportation, and the 
Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.
Sec. 10. This order is not intended to create, and does not create, any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person.
Sec. 11. For those persons whose property or interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to section 3 of this order who might have a 
constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the 
ability to transfer funds or assets instantaneously, prior notice to 
such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render 
these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these 
measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared 
in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or 
determination made pursuant to this order.
Sec. 12. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is authorized to submit the recurring and final 
reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and 
section 204(c) of the IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).
Sec. 13. (a) This order is effective at 12:01 eastern daylight time on 
May 12, 2004.
    (b) This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and published in 
the Federal Register.

Executive Order 13340 of May 18, 2004

Establishment of Great Lakes Interagency Task Force and Promotion of a 
Regional Collaboration of National Significance for the Great Lakes

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and to help establish a regional 
collaboration of national significance for the Great Lakes, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The Great Lakes are a national treasure constituting 
the largest freshwater system in the world. The United States and Canada 
have made great progress addressing past and current environmental 
impacts to the Great Lakes ecology. The Federal Government is committed 
to making progress on the many significant challenges that remain. Along 
with numerous State, tribal, and local programs, over 140 Federal 
programs help fund and implement environmental restoration and 
management activities throughout the Great Lakes system. A number of 
intergovernmental bodies are providing leadership in the region to 
address environmental and resource management issues in the Great Lakes 
system. These activities would benefit substantially from more 
systematic collaboration and better integration of effort. It is the 
policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts 
to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and 
community stewardship. To this end, the Federal Government will partner 
with the Great Lakes States, tribal and local governments, communities, 
and other interests to establish a regional collaboration to address 
nationally significant environmental and natural resource issues 
involving the Great Lakes. It is the further policy of the Federal 
Government that its executive departments and agencies will ensure that 
their programs are funding effective, coordinated, and environmentally 
sound activities in the Great Lakes system.
Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
    (a) ``Great Lakes'' means Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Huron 
(including Lake Saint Clair), Lake Michigan, and Lake Superior, and the 
connecting channels (Saint Marys River, Saint Clair River, Detroit 
River, Niagara River, and Saint Lawrence River to the Canadian Border).

[[Page 176]]

    (b) ``Great Lakes system'' means all the streams, rivers, lakes, and 
other bodies of water within the drainage basin of the Great Lakes.
Sec. 3. Great Lakes Interagency Task Force.
    (a) Task Force Purpose. To further the policy described in section 1 
of this order, there is established, within the Environmental Protection 
Agency for administrative purposes, the ``Great Lakes Interagency Task 
Force'' (Task Force) to:
                                                                     (i)
     Help convene and establish a process for collaboration among the 
    members of the Task Force and the members of the Working Group that 
    is established in paragraph b(ii) of this section, with the Great 
    Lakes States, local communities, tribes, regional bodies, and other 
    interests in the Great Lakes region regarding policies, strategies, 
    plans, programs, projects, activities, and priorities for the Great 
    Lakes system.
                                                                    (ii)
     Collaborate with Canada and its provinces and with bi-national 
    bodies involved in the Great Lakes region regarding policies, 
    strategies, projects, and priorities for the Great Lakes system.
                                                                   (iii)
     Coordinate the development of consistent Federal policies, 
    strategies, projects, and priorities for addressing the restoration 
    and protection of the Great Lakes system and assisting in the 
    appropriate management of the Great Lakes system.
                                                                    (iv)
     Develop outcome-based goals for the Great Lakes system relying 
    upon, among other things, existing data and science-based indicators 
    of water quality and related environmental factors. These goals 
    shall focus on outcomes such as cleaner water, sustainable 
    fisheries, and biodiversity of the Great Lakes system and ensure 
    that Federal policies, strategies, projects, and priorities support 
    measurable results.
                                                                     (v)

     Ensure coordinated government development and implementation of the 
    Great Lakes portion of the Global Earth Observation System of 
    Systems.
                                                                    (ix)
     Provide assistance and support to agencies represented on the Task 
    Force in their activities related to the Great Lakes system.
                                                                     (x)

Executive Order 13348 of July 22, 2004

Blocking Property of Certain Persons and Prohibiting the Importation of 
Certain Goods from Liberia

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 5 of 
the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c) 
(UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of 
United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1521 of December 22, 2003, 
and 1532 of March 12, 2004,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, note that 
the actions and policies of former Liberian President Charles Taylor and 
other persons, in particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian 
resources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds 
and property, have undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and the 
orderly development of its political, administrative, and economic 
institutions and resources. I further note that the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement signed on August 18, 2003, and the related ceasefire have not 
yet been universally implemented throughout Liberia, and that the 
illicit trade in round logs and timber products is linked to the 
proliferation of and trafficking in illegal arms, which perpetuate the 
Liberian conflict and fuel and exacerbate other conflicts throughout 
West Africa. I find that the actions, policies, and circumstances 
described above constitute an unusual and extraordinary

[[Page 190]]

threat to the foreign policy of the United States and hereby declare a 
national emergency to deal with that threat. To address that threat, I 
hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), 
and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), or regulations, 
orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this 
order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or 
permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all property 
and interests in property of the following persons, that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States 
persons, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
    (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
    (ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
                                                                     (A)
     to be or have been an immediate family member of Charles Taylor;
                                                                     (B)
     to have been a senior official of the former Liberian regime headed 
    by Charles Taylor or otherwise to have been or be a close ally or 
    associate of Charles Taylor or the former Liberian regime;
                                                                     (C)
     to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
    material, or technological support for, or goods or services in 
    support of, the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources, the 
    removal of Liberian resources from that country, and the secreting 
    of Liberian funds and property by any person whose property and 
    interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or
                                                                     (D)
     to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or 
    on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
    interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
    (b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of, any person whose property or interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section would 
seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared 
in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to,
    (i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of, any person whose property or 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order, and
    (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services from any such person.
Sec. 2. Except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order, the direct or 
indirect importation into the United States of any round log or timber 
product originating in Liberia is prohibited.

[[Page 191]]

Sec. 3. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 4. For purposes of this order: (a) the term ``person'' means an 
individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and
    (d) the term ``round log or timber product'' means any product 
classifiable in Chapter 44 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States.
Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who might have a 
constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the 
ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice 
to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would 
render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these 
measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared 
in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or 
determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and UNPA as may be necessary to carry 
out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may 
redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the 
United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies 
of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all

Executive Order 13350 of July 29, 2004

Termination of Emergency Declared in Executive Order 12722 With Respect 
to Iraq and Modification of Executive Order 13290, Executive Order 
13303, and Executive Order 13315

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws 
of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)(NEA), section 5 of the United 
Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c)(UNPA), and 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, have 
determined that the situation that gave rise to the declaration of a 
national emergency with respect to Iraq in Executive Order 12722 of 
August 2, 1990, has been significantly altered by the removal of the 
regime of Saddam Hussein and other developments. I hereby terminate the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 12722, revoke that 
Executive Order and Executive Order 12724 of August 9, 1990, Executive 
Order 12734 of November 14, 1990, Executive Order 12743 of January 18, 
1991, Executive Order 12751 of February 14, 1991, and Executive Order 
12817 of October 21, 1992, that are based on that national emergency. I 
hereby amend Executive Order 13290 of March 20, 2003, so that the 
authorities therein remain in

[[Page 197]]

effect based on the national emergency I declared in Executive Order 
13303 of May 22, 2003, and expanded in Executive Order 13315 of August 
28, 2003. At the same time, and in order to take additional steps to 
deal with the national emergency that I declared in Executive Order 
13303, and expanded in Executive Order 13315, with respect to the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States posed by obstacles to the orderly 
reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and 
security in that country, and the development of political, 
administrative and economic institutions in Iraq, I hereby order:
Section 1. Pursuant to section 202(a) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1622(a)), 
termination of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12722 
shall not affect any action taken or proceeding pending but not finally 
concluded or determined as of the effective date of this order, any 
action or proceeding based on any act committed prior to such date, or 
any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred prior 
to such date. Pursuant to section 207(a) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1706(a)), 
and subject to such regulations, orders, directives, or licenses as may 
be issued pursuant to this order, I hereby determine that the 
continuation of prohibitions with regard to transactions involving 
property blocked pursuant to Executive Orders 12722 or 12724 that 
continues to be blocked as of the effective date of this order is 
necessary on account of claims involving Iraq.
Sec. 2. The Annex to Executive Order 13315 is replaced and superseded in 
its entirety by the Annex to this order.
Sec. 3. I hereby amend Executive Order 13290 by removing ``the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 12722 of August 2, 1990'' and 
replacing it with ``the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13303 of March 20, 2003, and expanded in Executive Order 13315 of August 
28, 2003''.
Sec. 4. Unless licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant to this order 
or otherwise consistent with U.S. law, the trade in or transfer of 
ownership or possession of Iraqi cultural property or other items of 
archeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific, and religious 
importance that were illegally removed, or for which a reasonable 
suspicion exists that they were illegally removed, from the Iraq 
National Museum, the National Library, and other locations in Iraq since 
August 6, 1990, is prohibited.
Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type 
specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by or to 
persons determined to be subject to the sanctions imposed by Executive 
Order 13315 or by this order would seriously impair my ability to deal 
with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303, and 
expanded by Executive Order 13315, or would endanger the Armed Forces of 
the United States that are engaged in hostilities, and I hereby prohibit 
such donations as provided in section 1 of Executive Order 13315 as 
amended by this order.
Sec. 6. For those persons listed in the Annex to this order or 
determined to be subject to Executive Order 13315 or this order who 
might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that 
because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets 
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken 
pursuant to this order would render these

[[Page 198]]

measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to 
be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13303, and expanded by Executive Order 13315, there need be no 
prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to Executive 
Order 13315 or this order.
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and UNPA as may be necessary to carry 
out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may 
redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the 
United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of 
the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this 
order.
Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is authorized to determine subsequent to the 
issuance of the order, that circumstances no longer warrant the 
inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and that such person is 
therefore no longer covered within the scope of the order.
Sec. 9. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, 
instrumentalities, or entities, officers or employees, or any other 
person.
Sec. 10. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
July 30, 2004. This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and 
published in the Federal Register.
George W. Bush
The White House,

Establishing an Emergency Board To Investigate a Dispute Between the 
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and Its Conductors 
Represented by the United Transportation Union

A dispute exists between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation 
Authority and its conductors represented by the United Transportation 
Union.
The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the 
Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-188 (the ``Act'').
A first emergency board to investigate and report on the dispute was 
established on April 12, 2004, by Executive Order 13334 of April 10, 
2004. The emergency board terminated upon issuance of its report. 
Subsequently, its recommendations were not accepted by the parties.
A party empowered by the Act has requested that the President establish 
a second emergency board pursuant to section 9A of the Act (45 U.S.C. 
159a).
Section 9A(e) of the Act provides that the President, upon such request, 
shall appoint a second emergency board to investigate and report on the

the Act, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment of Emergency Board (``Board''). There is 
established, effective August 10, 2004, a Board of three members to be 
appointed by the President to investigate and report on this dispute. No 
member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization 
of railroad employees or any carrier. The Board shall perform its 
functions subject to the availability of funds.
Sec. 2. Report. Within 30 days after the creation of the Board, the 
parties to the dispute shall submit to the Board final offers for 
settlement of the dispute. Within 30 days after the submission of final 
offers for settlement of the dispute, the Board shall submit a report to 
the President setting forth its selection of the most reasonable offer.
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 9A(h) of the Act, 
from the time a request to establish a second emergency board is made 
until 60 days after the Board submits its report to the President, the 
parties to the controversy shall make no change in the conditions out of 
which the dispute arose except by agreement of the parties.
Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of the Board are 
records of the Office of the President and upon the Board's termination 
shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National Mediation 
Board.

[[Page 210]]

Sec. 5. Expiration. The Board shall terminate upon the submission of the 
report provided for in section 2 of this order.

Executive Order 13356 of August 27, 2004

Strengthening the Sharing of Terrorism Information To Protect Americans

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws 
of the United States of America, and in order to further strengthen the 
effective conduct of United States intelligence activities and protect 
the territory, people, and interests of the United States of America, 
including against terrorist attacks, it is hereby ordered as follows:

[[Page 224]]

Section 1. Policy. To the maximum extent consistent with applicable law, 
agencies shall, in the design and use of information systems and in the 
dissemination of information among agencies:
    (a) give the highest priority to (i) the detection, prevention, 
disruption, preemption, and mitigation of the effects of terrorist 
activities against the territory, people, and interests of the United 
States of America, (ii) the interchange of terrorism information among 
agencies, (iii) the interchange of terrorism information between 
agencies and appropriate authorities of States and local governments, 
and (iv) the protection of the ability of agencies to acquire additional 
such information; and
    (b) protect the freedom, information privacy, and other legal rights 
of Americans in the conduct of activities implementing subsection (a).
Sec. 2. Duty of Heads of Agencies Possessing or Acquiring Terrorism 
Information. To implement the policy set forth in section 1 of this 
order, the head of each agency that possesses or acquires terrorism 
information:
    (a) shall promptly give access to the terrorism information to the 
head of each other agency that has counterterrorism functions, and 
provide the terrorism information to each such agency in accordance with 
the standards and information sharing guidance issued pursuant to this 
order, unless otherwise directed by the President, and consistent with 
(i) the statutory responsibilities of the agencies providing and 
receiving the information, (ii) any guidance issued by the Attorney 
General to fulfill the policy set forth in subsection 1(b) of this 
order, and (iii) other applicable law, including section 103(c)(7) of 
the National Security Act of 1947, section 892 of the Homeland Security 
Act of 2002, Executive Order 12958 of April 17, 1995, as amended, and 
Executive Order 13311 of July 29, 2003;
    (b) shall cooperate in and facilitate production of reports based on 
terrorism information with contents and formats that permit 
dissemination that maximizes the utility of the information in 
protecting the territory, people, and interests of the United States; 
and
    (c) shall facilitate implementation of the plan developed by the 
Information Systems Council established by section 5 of this order.
Sec. 3. Preparing Terrorism Information for Maximum Distribution within 
Intelligence Community. To assist in expeditious and effective 
implementation by agencies within the Intelligence Community of the 
policy set forth in section 1 of this order, the Director of Central 
Intelligence shall, in consultation with the Attorney General and the 
other heads of agencies within the Intelligence Community, set forth not 
later than 90 days after the date of this order, and thereafter as 
appropriate, common standards for the sharing of terrorism information 
by agencies within the Intelligence Community with (i) other agencies 
within the Intelligence Community, (ii) other agencies having 
counterterrorism functions, and (iii) through or in coordination with 
the Department of Homeland Security, appropriate authorities of State 
and local governments. These common standards shall improve information 
sharing by such methods as:
    (a) requiring, at the outset of the intelligence collection and 
analysis process, the creation of records and reporting, for both raw 
and processed information including, for example, metadata and content, 
in such a manner that sources and methods are protected so that the 
information can be distributed at lower classification levels, and by 
creating unclassified versions for distribution whenever possible;

[[Page 225]]

    (b) requiring records and reports related to terrorism information 
to be produced with multiple versions at an unclassified level and at 
varying levels of classification, for example on an electronic tearline 
basis, allowing varying degrees of access by other agencies and 
personnel commensurate with their particular security clearance levels 
and special access approvals;
    (c) requiring terrorism information to be shared free of originator 
controls, including, for example, controls requiring the consent of the 
originating agency prior to the dissemination of the information outside 
any other agency to which it has been made available, to the maximum 
extent permitted by applicable law, Executive Orders, or Presidential 
guidance;
    (d) minimizing the applicability of information compartmentalization 
systems to terrorism information, to the maximum extent permitted by 
applicable law, Executive Orders, and Presidential guidance; and
    (e) ensuring the establishment of appropriate arrangements providing 
incentives for, and holding personnel accountable for, increased sharing 
of terrorism information, consistent with requirements of the Nation's 
security and with applicable law, Executive Orders, and Presidential 
guidance.
Sec. 4. Requirements for Collection of Terrorism Information Inside the 
United States. (a) The Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, and the Director of Central Intelligence shall, not later than 
90 days after the date of this order, jointly submit to the President, 
through the Assistants to the President for National Security Affairs 
and Homeland Security, their recommendation on the establishment of 
executive branch-wide collection and sharing requirements, procedures, 
and guidelines for terrorism information to be collected within the 
United States, including, but not limited to, from publicly available 
sources, including nongovernmental databases.
    (b) The recommendation submitted under subsection (a) of this 
section shall also:

  (i) address requirements and guidelines for the collection and sharing of 
other information necessary to protect the territory, people, and interests 
of the United States; and

  (ii) propose arrangements for ensuring that officers of the United States 
with responsibilities for protecting the territory, people, and interests 
of the United States are provided with clear, understandable, consistent, 
effective, and lawful procedures and guidelines for the collection, 
handling, distribution, and retention of information.

Sec. 5. Establishment of Information Systems Council. (a) There is 
established an Information Systems Council (Council), chaired by a 
designee of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and 
composed exclusively of designees of: the Secretaries of State, the 
Treasury, Defense, Commerce, Energy, and Homeland Security; the Attorney 
General; the Director of Central Intelligence; the Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Director of the National 
Counterterrorism Center, once that position is created and filled (and 
until that time the Director of the Terrorism Threat Integration 
Center); and such other heads of departments or agencies as the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget may designate.

[[Page 226]]

    (b) The mission of the Council is to plan for and oversee the 
establishment of an interoperable terrorism information sharing 
environment to facilitate automated sharing of terrorism information 
among appropriate agencies to implement the policy set forth in section 
1 of this order.
    (c) Not later than 120 days after the date of this order, the 
Council shall report to the President through the Assistants to the 
President for National Security Affairs and Homeland Security, on a 
plan, with proposed milestones, timetables for achieving those 
milestones, and identification of resources, for the establishment of 
the proposed interoperable terrorism information sharing environment. 
The plan shall, at a minimum:

  (i) describe and define the parameters of the proposed interoperable 
terrorism information sharing environment, including functions, 
capabilities, and resources;

  (ii) identify and, as appropriate, recommend the consolidation and 
elimination of current programs, systems, and processes used by agencies to 
share terrorism information, and recommend as appropriate the redirection 
of existing resources to support the interoperable terrorism information 
sharing environment;

  (iii) identify gaps, if any, between existing technologies, programs, and 
systems used by agencies to share terrorism information and the parameters 
of the proposed interoperable terrorism information sharing environment;

  (iv) recommend near-term solutions to address any such gaps until the 
interoperable terrorism information sharing environment can be established;

  (v) recommend a plan for implementation of the interoperable terrorism 
information sharing environment, including roles and responsibilities, 
measures of success, and deadlines for the development and implementation 
of functions and capabilities from the initial stage to full operational 
capability;

  (vi) recommend how the proposed interoperable terrorism information 
sharing environment can be extended to allow interchange of terrorism 
information between agencies and appropriate authorities of States and 
local governments; and

  (vii) recommend whether and how the interoperable terrorism information 
sharing environment should be expanded, or designed so as to allow future 
expansion, for purposes of encompassing other categories of intelligence 
and information.

Sec. 6. Definitions. As used in this order:
    (a) the term ``agency'' has the meaning set forth for the term 
``executive agency'' in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, 
together with the Department of Homeland Security, but includes the 
Postal Rate Commission and the United States Postal Service and excludes

any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, 
instrumentalities or entities, its officers, employees or agents, or any

Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004

Modifying the Protection Granted to the Development Fund for Iraq and 
Certain Property in Which Iraq Has an Interest and Protecting the 
Central Bank of Iraq

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) 
(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 
5 of the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c) 
(UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby 
modify the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13303 of May 22, 2003, and expanded in Executive Order 13315 of August 
28, 2003, and further modified in Executive Order 13350 of July 29, 
2004, to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States posed by obstacles to 
the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of 
peace and security in that country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. I find that the 
threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Central Bank 
of Iraq constitutes one of these obstacles. I further determine that, 
consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1483 of May 
22, 2003, and 1546 of June 8, 2004, the steps taken in Executive Order 
13303 to deal with the national emergency declared therein need to be 
limited so that such steps do not apply with respect to any final 
judgment arising out of a contractual obligation entered into by the 
Government of Iraq, including any agency or instrumentality thereof, 
after June 30, 2004, and so that, with respect to Iraqi petroleum

[[Page 237]]

and petroleum products and interests therein, such steps shall apply 
only until title passes to the initial purchaser.
I hereby order:
Section 1. Section 1 of Executive Order 13303 is hereby amended to read 
as follows:
    ``Section 1. (a) Except as provided in section 1(b) of this order, 
and unless licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant to this order, any 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process is prohibited and shall be deemed null and void with 
respect to the following:

(i) the Development Fund for Iraq;

(ii) all Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, but 
only until title passes to the initial purchaser, and proceeds, 
obligations, or any financial instruments of any nature whatsoever arising 
from or related to the sale or marketing thereof, and interests therein, in 
which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest, that are 
in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that 
are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States 
persons; and

(iii) any accounts, assets, investments, or any other property of any kind 
owned by, belonging to, or held by the Central Bank of Iraq, or held, 
maintained, or otherwise controlled by any financial institution of any 
kind in the name of, on behalf of, or otherwise for the Central Bank of 
Iraq.

    (b) The prohibition in section 1(a) of this order shall not apply 
with respect to any final judgment arising out of a contractual 
obligation entered into by the Government of Iraq, including any agency 
or instrumentality thereof, after June 30, 2004.''
Sec. 2. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and the UNPA as may be necessary to 
carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may 
redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the 
United States Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of 
the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this 
order.
    (b) Nothing contained in this order shall relieve a person from any 
requirement to obtain a license or other authorization in compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations.
Sec. 3. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, 
benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
in equity by a party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, entities, officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 4. This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and published in 
the Federal Register.

Executive Order 13365 of December 3, 2004

2004 Amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including chapter 47 of title 10, 
United States Code (Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. 801-
946), and in order to prescribe amendments to the Manual for Courts-
Martial, United States, prescribed by Executive Order 12473, as amended, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. (a) Paragraph 4 of the Preamble to Part I of the Manual for 
Courts-Martial, United States, is amended by adding a third subparagraph 
to read as follows:
    ``The Department of Defense Joint Service Committee (JSC) on 
Military Justice reviews the Manual for Courts-Martial and proposes 
amendments to the Department of Defense for con sideration by the 
President on an annual basis. In conducting its annual review, the JSC 
is guided by DoD Directive 5500.17, ``The Roles and Responsibilities of 
the Joint Service Committee (JSC) on Military Justice.'' DoD Directive 
5500.17 includes provisions allowing public participation in the annual 
review process.''
    (b) Department of Defense Directive 5500.17 shall be included as 
Appendix 26 to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States.
Sec. 2. Part II of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, is 
amended as follows:
    (a) R.C.M. 307(c)(3) is amended to read as follows:

  ``Specification. A specification is a plain, concise, and definite 
statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged. A 
specification is sufficient if it alleges every element of the charged 
offense expressly or by necessary implication. Except for aggravating 
factors under R.C.M. 1003(d) and R.C.M. 1004, facts that increase the 
maximum authorized punishment must be alleged in order to permit the 
possible increased punishment. No particular format is required.''

    (b) R.C.M. 707(b)(3)(D) is amended to read as follows:

  ``Rehearings. If a rehearing is ordered or authorized by an appellate 
court, a new 120-day time period under this rule shall begin on the date 
that the responsible convening authority receives the record of trial and 
the opinion authorizing or directing a rehearing. An accused is brought to 
trial within the meaning of this rule at the time of arraignment under 
R.C.M. 904 or, if arraignment is not required (such as in the case of a 
sentence-only rehearing), at the time of the first session under R.C.M. 
803.''

    (c) R.C.M. 707(c) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(c) Excludable delay. All periods of time during which appellate courts 
have issued stays in the proceedings, or the accused is absent without 
authority, or the accused is hospitalized due to incompetence, or is 
otherwise in the custody of the Attorney General, shall be excluded when 
determining whether the period in subsection (a) of this rule has run. All 
other pretrial delays approved by a military judge or the convening 
authority shall be similarly excluded.''

[[Page 239]]

    (d) R.C.M. 707(d) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(d) Remedy. A failure to comply with this rule will result in dismissal 
of the affected charges, or, in a sentence-only rehearing, sentence relief 
as appropriate.

        ``(1) Dismissal. Dismissal will be with or without prejudice to 
        the government's right to reinstitute court-martial proceedings 
        against the accused for the same offense at a later date. The 
        charges must be dismissed with prejudice where the accused has 
        been deprived of his or her constitutional right to a speedy 
        trial. In determining whether to dismiss charges with or without 
        prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the 
        following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts and 
        circumstances of the case that lead to dismissal; the impact of 
        a re-prosecution on the administration of justice; and any 
        prejudice to the accused resulting from the denial of a speedy 
        trial.
        ``(2) Sentence relief. In determining whether or how much 
        sentence relief is appropriate, the military judge shall 
        consider, among others, each of the following factors: the 
        length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the accused's 
        demand for speedy trial, and any prejudice to the accused from 
        the delay. Any sentence relief granted will be applied against 
        the sentence approved by the convening authority.''
    (e) R.C.M. 806(b) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(b) Control of spectators and closure.

        ``(1) Control of spectators. In order to maintain the dignity 
        and decorum of the proceedings or for other good cause, the 
        military judge may reasonably limit the number of spectators in, 
        and the means of access to, the courtroom, and exclude specific 
        persons from the courtroom. When excluding specific persons, the 
        military judge must make findings on the record establishing the 
        reason for the exclusion, the basis for the military judge's 
        belief that exclusion is necessary, and that the exclusion is as 
        narrowly tailored as possible.
        ``(2) Closure. Courts-martial shall be open to the public unless 
        (1) there is a substantial probability that an overriding 
        interest will be prejudiced if the proceedings remain open; (2) 
        closure is no broader than necessary to protect the overriding 
        interest; (3) reasonable alternatives to closure were considered 
        and found inadequate; and (4) the military judge makes case-
        specific findings on the record justifying closure.''
    (f) R.C.M. 916(k)(2) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(2) Partial mental responsibility. A mental condition not amounting to 
a lack of mental responsibility under subsection (k)(1) of this rule is not 
an affirmative defense.''

    (g) R.C.M. 1103(f)(2) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(2) Direct a rehearing as to any offense of which the accused was found 
guilty if the finding is supported by the summary of the evidence contained 
in the record, provided that the convening authority may not approve any 
sentence imposed at such a rehearing more severe than or in excess of that 
adjudged by the earlier court-martial.''

    (h) The following subsection (iv) is inserted after R.C.M. 
1107(e)(1)(B)(iii) to read as follows:

[[Page 240]]

  ``(iv) Sentence reassessment. If a superior authority has approved some 
of the findings of guilty and has authorized a rehearing as to other 
offenses and the sentence, the convening authority may, unless otherwise 
directed, reassess the sentence based on the approved findings of guilty 
and dismiss the remaining charges. Reassessment is appropriate only where 
the convening authority determines that the accused's sentence would have 
been at least of a certain magnitude had the prejudicial error not been 
committed and the reassessed sentence is appropriate in relation to the 
affirmed findings of guilty.''

    (i) R.C.M. 1108(b) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(b) Who may suspend and remit. The convening authority may, after 
approving the sentence, suspend the execution of all or any part of the 
sentence of a court-martial, except for a sentence of death. The general 
court-martial convening authority over the accused at the time of the 
court-martial may, when taking the action under R.C.M. 1112(f), suspend or 
remit any part of the sentence. The Secretary concerned and, when 
designated by the Secretary concerned, any Under Secretary, Assistant 
Secretary, Judge Advocate General, or commanding officer may suspend or 
remit any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence other than 
a sentence approved by the President or a sentence of confinement for life 
without eligibility for parole that has been ordered executed. The 
Secretary concerned may, however, suspend or remit the unexecuted part of a 
sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole only after 
the service of a period of confinement of not less than 20 years. The 
commander of the accused who has the authority to convene a court-martial 
of the kind that adjudged the sentence may suspend or remit any part of the 
unexecuted part of any sentence by summary court-martial or of any sentence 
by special court-martial that does not include a bad-conduct discharge 
regardless of whether the person acting has previously approved the 
sentence. The ``unexecuted part of any sentence'' is that part that has 
been approved and ordered executed but that has not actually been carried 
out.''

    (j) R.C.M. 1305(c) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(c) Authentication. The summary court-martial shall authenticate the 
record by signing the original record of trial.''

    (k) R.C.M. 1306(b)(1) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(1) Who shall act. Except as provided herein, the convening authority 
shall take action in accordance with R.C.M. 1107. The convening authority 
shall not take action before the period prescribed in R.C.M. 1105(c)(2) has 
expired, unless the right to submit matters has been waived under R.C.M. 
1105(d).''

Sec. 3. Part III of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, is 
amended as follows:
    (a) Mil. R. Evid. 103(a)(2) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(2) Offer of proof. In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the 
substance of the evidence was made known to the military judge by offer or 
was apparent from the context within which questions were asked. Once the 
military judge makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or 
excluding evidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an 
objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal. The 
standard provided in this subdivision does not apply to errors involving

[[Page 241]]

requirements imposed by the Constitution of the United States as applied to 
members of the armed forces except insofar as the error arises under these 
rules and this subdivision provides a standard that is more advantageous to 
the accused than the constitutional standard.''

    (b) Mil. R. Evid. 404(a) is amended to read as follows:

  ``(a) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person's character or a 
trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in 
conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except:

        ``(1) Character of accused. Evidence of a pertinent trait of 
        character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut 
        the same, or if evidence of a pertinent trait of character of 
        the alleged victim of the crime is offered by an accused and 
        admitted under Mil. R. Evid. 404(a)(2), evidence of the same 
        trait of character, if relevant, of the accused offered by the 
        prosecution;
        ``(2) Character of alleged victim. Evidence of a pertinent trait 
        of character of the alleged victim of the crime offered by an 
        accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same, or evidence of 
        a character trait of peacefulness of the alleged victim offered 
        by the prosecution in a homicide or assault case to rebut 
        evidence that the alleged victim was an aggressor;
        ``(3) Character of witness. Evidence of the character of a 
        witness, as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 607, 608, and 609.''
    (c) Mil. R. Evid. 701 is amended to read as follows:

  ``If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness' testimony 
in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or 
inferences that are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, 
(b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the 
determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based in scientific, 
technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.''

    (d) Mil. R. Evid. 702 is amended to read as follows:

  ``If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist 
the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in 
issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, 
training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or 
otherwise if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) 
the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) 
the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of 
the case.''

    (e) Mil. R. Evid. 703 is amended to read as follows:

  ``The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an 
opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert, 
at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in 
the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, 
the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence in order for the 
opinion or inference to be admitted. Facts or data that are otherwise 
inadmissible shall not be disclosed to the members by the proponent of the 
opinion or inference unless the military judge determines that their 
probative value in assisting the members to evaluate the expert's opinion 
substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.''

    (f) Mil. R. Evid. 803(6) is amended to read as follows:

[[Page 242]]

  ``Records of regularly conducted activity. A memorandum, report, record, 
or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or 
diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, 
a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted 
business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business 
activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all 
as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or 
by certification that complies with Mil. R. Evid. 902(11) or any other 
statute permitting certification in a criminal proceeding in a court of the 
United States, unless the source of the information or the method or 
circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness. The term 
``business'' as used in this paragraph includes the armed forces, a 
business, institution, association, profession, occupation, and calling of 
every kind, whether or not conducted for profit. Among those memoranda, 
reports, records, or data compilations normally admissible pursuant to this 
paragraph are enlistment papers, physical examination papers, outline-
figure and fingerprint cards, forensic laboratory reports, chain of custody 
documents, morning reports and other personnel accountability documents, 
service records, officer and enlisted qualification records, logs, unit 
personnel diaries, individual equipment records, daily strength records of 
prisoners, and rosters of prisoners.''

    (g) The following subsection (11) is inserted after Mil. R. Evid. 
902(10) to read as follows:

  ``(11) Certified domestic records of regularly conducted activity. The 
original or a duplicate of a domestic record of regularly conducted 
activity that would be admissible under Mil. R. Evid. 803(6) if accompanied 
by a written declaration of its custodian or other qualified person, in a 
manner complying with any Act of Congress or rule prescribed by the Supreme 
Court pursuant to statutory authority, certifying that the record (A) was 
made at or near the time of the occurrence of the matters set forth by, or 
from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge of those matters; 
(B) was kept in the course of the regularly conducted activity; and (C) was 
made by the regularly conducted activity as a regular practice. A party 
intending to offer a record into evidence under this paragraph must provide 
written notice of that intention to all adverse parties, and must make the 
record and declaration available for inspection sufficiently in advance of 
their offer into evidence to provide an adverse party with a fair 
opportunity to challenge them.''

    (h) Mil. R. Evid. 1102 is amended to read as follows:

  ``(a) Amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to the

Notice of January 5, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya

On January 7, 1986, by Executive Order 12543, President Reagan declared 
a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Libya. On 
January 8, 1986, by Executive Order 12544, the President took additional 
measures to block Libyan assets in the United States. The President has 
transmitted a notice continuing this emergency to the Congress and the 
Federal Register every year since 1986.
The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been 
fully resolved, although there have been some positive developments.
On September 12, 2003, the United Nations Security Council adopted 
Resolution 1506 (UNSCR 1506), ending the United Nations sanctions 
against Libya. These U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 and 1993 as a 
result of Libyan involvement in the terrorist bombings of Pan Am 103 in 
1988 and UTA 772 in 1989, and included travel restrictions, an arms 
embargo, and financial sanctions. The UNSCR 1506 lifted these sanctions 
after Libya addressed the requirements of the relevant UNSC Resolutions, 
including accepting responsibility for the actions of its officials in 
the Pan Am 103 attack and arranging to compensate the families of the 
victims. The United

[[Page 258]]

States abstained from voting on the lifting of U.N. sanctions, and it 
made clear that it continued to have serious concerns about other Libyan 
policies and actions, including Libya's pursuit of weapons of mass 
destruction, Libya's role with respect to terrorism, and Libya's poor 
human rights record.
On December 19, 2003, Prime Minister Blair and I announced separately 
that Libya's leader, Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, had agreed to eliminate 
all elements of Libya's chemical and nuclear weapons program, declare 
all nuclear activities to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
accept international inspections to ensure Libya's complete adherence to 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and sign the IAEA Additional 
Protocol, accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention, eliminate ballistic 
missiles beyond 300 kilometer range, and immediately and unconditionally 
allow inspectors from international organizations to enter Libya. 
Libya's declaration of December 19, 2003, marks an important and welcome 
step toward addressing the concerns of the world community. As Libya 
takes tangible steps to address those concerns, the United States will 
in turn take reciprocal tangible steps to recognize Libya's progress. 
Libya's agreement marks the beginning of a process of rejoining the 
community of nations, but its declaration of December 19, 2003, must be 
followed by verification of concrete steps.
Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to Libya. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register 
and transmitted to the Congress.
GEORGE W. BUSH
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    January 5, 2004.

Export Control Act

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Consistent with the provisions of section 503(a) of the Foreign

Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the ``Act''), I hereby designate the

Notice of January 16, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four 
additional persons, including Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt 
the Middle East peace process.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, as expanded 
on August 20, 1998, and the measures adopted on those dates to deal with 
that emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2004. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the 
Middle East peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of February 26, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on subsequent 
occasions, the Cuban Government stated its intent to forcefully defend 
its sovereignty against any U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft that 
might enter Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a 
flotilla or peaceful protest. Since these events, the Cuban government 
has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the future use of 
reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may 
engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation 
of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of March 2, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Persons 
Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, I declared a national 
emergency blocking the property of persons undermining democratic 
processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action 
to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy 
of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions, thus contributing to 
the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically 
motivated violence and intimidation in that country, and to political 
and economic instability in the southern African region.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency must continue 
in effect beyond March 6, 2004. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency blocking the property of 
persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.

Memorandum of March 3, 2004

Presidential Determination on Imports of Certain Ductile Iron Waterworks 
Fittings from the People's Republic of China

Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Consistent with section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 2451), I have determined the action I will take with respect to 
the affirmative determination of the United States International Trade 
Commission (USITC Investigation TA-421-4) regarding imports of certain 
ductile iron waterworks fittings (pipe fittings) from China. After 
considering all relevant aspects of the investigation, I have determined 
that providing import relief for the U.S. pipe fittings industry is not 
in the national economic interest of the United States. In particular, I 
find that the import relief would have an adverse impact on the United 
States economy clearly greater than the benefits of such action.
The facts of this case indicate that imposing the USITC's recommended 
tariff-rate quota remedy or any other import relief available under 
section 421 would be ineffective because imports from third countries 
would likely replace curtailed Chinese imports. The switch to third 
country imports could occur quickly because the major U.S. importers 
already import substantial quantities from countries such as India, 
Brazil, Korea, and Mexico. Because importers' existing inventories of 
imports will likely cover demand for approximately 6 to 12 months from 
the imposition of import relief, a switch from China to alternative 
import sources would not likely lead to significant additional demand 
for domestically produced pipe fittings, even accounting for a time lag 
in making that switch. Under these circumstances, import relief would 
provide no meaningful benefit to domestic producers.
In addition, import relief would cost U.S. consumers substantially more 
than the increased income that could be realized by domestic producers. 
Indeed, the USITC estimated that its recommended remedy would generate a 
negative net domestic welfare effect of between $2.3 million and $3.7 
million in the first year alone.
While not necessary in reaching my determination that imposing import 
relief would have an adverse impact on the United States economy clearly 
greater than the benefits, it is also worth noting two additional 
points:

[[Page 266]]

                                                                <bullet>
    First, evidence suggests that domestic producers enjoy a strong 
    competitive position in the U.S. market, and in fact the largest 
    domestic producer recently announced price increases nationwide 
    ranging from 8 to 35 percent. The two smaller domestic producers and 
    the major U.S. importers have publicly indicated that they would 
    follow these price increases.
                                                                <bullet>
    Second, in 2002 and 2003, imports of this product have been 
    relatively stable in volume terms and have shown a slight decline in 
    value terms.
The circumstances of this case make clear that the U.S. national 
economic interest would not be served by the imposition of import relief 
under section 421. I remain fully committed to exercising the important 
authority granted to me under section 421 when the circumstances of a 
particular case warrant it.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

Notice of March 10, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran, including its support for 
international terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace 
process, and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to 
deliver them. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959 
imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further respond to this threat, 
and on August 19, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13059 
consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2004. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is 
distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2003. This notice shall 
be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of May 17, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma

On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, certifying 
to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-208), that the Government of Burma has committed large-scale 
repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 
1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
United States persons contained in that section. The President also 
declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions 
and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter 
alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq. On July 28, 2003, I issued Executive Order 13310 taking 
additional steps with respect to that national emergency by putting in 
place an import ban required by the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 
2003 and prohibiting exports of financial services to Burma and the 
dealing in property in which certain designated Burmese persons have an 
interest.
Because actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to pose 
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on May 20, 
1997, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency 
must continue in effect beyond May 20, 2004. Therefore, in accordance 
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Burma.

Notice of May 20, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency Protecting the Development Fund 
for Iraq and Certain Other Property in Which Iraq Has an Interest

On May 22, 2003, by Executive Order 13303, I declared a national 
emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other 
property in which Iraq has an interest, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action 
to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the obstacles 
to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance 
of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq constituted by the 
threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Development 
Fund for Iraq, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests 
therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any 
nature whatsoever arising from or related to the sale or marketing 
thereof.
On August 28, 2003, in Executive Order 13315, I expanded the scope of 
this national emergency to block the property of the former Iraqi 
regime, its senior officials and their family members as the removal of 
Iraqi property from that country by certain senior officials of the 
former Iraqi regime and their immediate family members constitutes an 
obstacle to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and 
maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of 
political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq.
Because these obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared on May 22, 2003, and the measures adopted on that 
date and on August 28, 2003, to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond May 22, 2004. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency protecting the Development 
Fund for Iraq and certain other property in which Iraq has an interest.

Notice of June 16, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Usable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``Order'') blocking property and interests in property of the Government 
of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereinafter come within 
the possession or control of United States persons that are directly 
related to the implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of the Russian 
Federation Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium 
Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related 
contracts and agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU 
Agreements allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived 
from nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial 
purposes. The Order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., and 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of 
the Russian Federation.
A major national security goal of the United States is to ensure that 
fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons pursuant to 
various arms control and disarmament agreements is dedicated to peaceful 
uses (such as downblending to low enriched uranium for peaceful 
commercial uses), subject to transparency measures, and protected from 
diversion to activities of proliferation concern. Pursuant to the HEU 
Agreements, weapons-grade uranium extracted from Russian nuclear weapons 
is converted to low enriched uranium for use as fuel in commercial 
nuclear reactors. The Order blocks and protects from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process the property and interests in property of the Government of the 
Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation of 
the HEU Agreements and that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of United States persons.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2004, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to weapons-usable fissile material

[[Page 279]]

in the territory of the Russian Federation. This notice shall be 
published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of June 24, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western 
Balkans

On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the Western Balkans pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of 
persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) 
extremist violence in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and 
elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing 
implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo. Subsequent 
to the declaration of the national emergency, the actions of persons 
obstructing implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia also became a pressing 
concern. I amended Executive Order 13219 on May 28, 2003, in Executive 
Order 13304 to address this concern and to take additional steps with 
respect to the national emergency. Because the actions of persons 
threatening the peace and international stabilization efforts in the 
Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures adopted 
on that

[[Page 280]]

date and thereafter to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect 
beyond June 26, 2004. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act

funds may be used, as appropriate, to provide contributions to 
international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, and, as 
necessary, for administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population,

the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under 
this authority, and to arrange for the publication of this memorandum in

Furthermore, I hereby determine that it is in the national security 
interest of the United States to waive that sanction, pursuant to

180 days from the date hereof or until such time as the next report

By Executive Order 13223 of September 14, 2001, and Executive Order

Presidential Determination No. 2004-47 of September 15, 2004

Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug 
Producing Countries for FY05

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the 
following countries as major drug-transit or major illicit drug 
producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, 
China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, 
Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, 
Venezuela, and Vietnam.
The Majors List applies by its terms to ``countries.'' The United States 
Government interprets the term broadly to include entities that exercise 
autonomy over actions or omissions that could lead to a decision to 
place them on the list and, subsequently, to determine their eligibility 
for certification. A country's presence on the Majors List is not 
necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics 
efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with 
the statutory definition of a major drug-transit or drug-producing 
country set forth in section 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug-transit or 
illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the 
combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow 
drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most 
assiduous enforcement measures.
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma as a 
country that has failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to 
adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics 
agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the 
FAA. Attached to this report is a justification (statement of 
explanation) for the determination on Burma, as required by section 
706(2)(B).
I have removed Thailand from the list of major drug-transit or major 
illicit drug producing countries. Thailand's opium poppy cultivation is 
well below the levels specified in the FRAA; no heroin processing 
laboratories have been found in Thailand for several years, and Thailand 
is no longer a significant direct source of illicit narcotic or 
psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances significantly 
affecting the United States; nor is it a country through which such 
drugs or substances are transported.
In contrast to the Government of Haiti's dismal performance last year 
under the Aristide regime, the new Interim Government of Haiti (IGOH), 
headed by Prime Minister Latortue, has taken substantive--if limited--
counternarcotics actions in the few months it has been in office. 
Nevertheless, we remain deeply concerned about the ability of Haitian 
law enforcement to reorganize and restructure sufficiently to carry out 
sustained counternarcotics efforts.
The decreased use of MDMA (Ecstasy) among young people in the United 
States is a hopeful sign, but we continue to place priority on stopping 
the threat of club drugs, including MDMA, of which The Netherlands 
continues to be the dominant source country. The Government of The 
Netherlands is an enthusiastic and capable partner, and we commend its 
efforts.

[[Page 291]]

We continue to be concerned, however, by obstacles to mutual legal 
assistance and extradition from The Netherlands. There is a need to work 
more deliberately to disrupt the criminal organizations responsible for 
the production and trafficking of synthetic drugs. Specifically, we urge 
enhanced use of financial investigation, including full exploitation of 
anti-money laundering statutes and financial investigators to identify 
and dismantle trafficking organizations, and to seize and forfeit the 
assets acquired from the drug trade.
While the vast majority of illicit drugs entering the United States 
continue to come from South America and Mexico, we remain concerned 
about the substantial flow of illicit drugs from Canada. I commend 
Canada for its successful efforts to curb the diversion of precursor 
chemicals used in methamphetamine production. We are now working 
intensively with Canadian authorities to address the increase in the 
smuggling of Canadian-produced marijuana into the United States; however 
we are concerned the lack of significant judicial sanctions against 
marijuana producers is resulting in greater involvement in the 
burgeoning marijuana industry by organized criminal groups. Canada has 
expressed concern to us about the flow of cocaine and other illicit 
substances through the United States into Canada. United States and 
Canadian law enforcement personnel have collaborated on a number of 
investigations that have led to the dismantling of several criminal 
organizations. The two governments will continue to work closely in the 
year ahead to confront these shared threats.
Nigeria put measures in place to increase the effectiveness of the 
National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, and also arrested a trafficker 
wanted by the United States, which met the agreed-upon interdiction 
targets. However, Nigeria must take significant and decisive action to 
investigate and prosecute political corruption, which continues to 
undermine the transparency of its government. President Obasanjo took 
steps to address corruption at the G-8 meetings in Sea Island, Georgia, 
by entering into a Compact to Promote Transparency and Combat 
Corruption. Positive transparent measures will in turn benefit Nigeria's 
anti-narcotics efforts, the rule of law, and all democratic 
institutions.
Despite good faith efforts on the part of the central Afghanistan 
government, we are concerned about increased opium crop production in 
the provinces.
We are deeply concerned about heroin and methamphetamine linked to North 
Korea being trafficked to East Asian countries. We consider it highly 
likely that state agents and enterprises in North Korea are involved in 
the narcotics trade. While we know that some opium poppy is cultivated 
in North Korea, reliable information confirming the extent of opium 
production is currently lacking. There are also clear indications that 
North Koreans traffic in, and probably manufacture, methamphetamine. In 
recent years, authorities in the region have routinely seized shipments 
of methamphetamine and/or heroin that had been transferred to 
traffickers' ships from North Korean vessels. The April 2003 seizure of 
125 kilograms of heroin smuggled to Australia aboard the North Korean-
owned vessel ``Pong Su'' is the latest and largest seizure of heroin 
pointing to North Korean complicity in the drug trade. Although there is 
no evidence that narcotics originating in or transiting North Korea 
reach the United States, we are

[[Page 292]]

working closely with our partners in the region to stop North Korean 
involvement in illicit narcotics production and trafficking.
We appreciate the efforts of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and others in the 
region to stop the diversion of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine used to 
manufacture methamphetamine. However, considering the growing 
methamphetamine problem in North America and Asia, additional 
collaborative efforts to control these precursor chemicals are 
necessary.
You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under 
section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in 
the Federal Register.

Notice of September 21, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Persons Who 
Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support Terrorism

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or 
support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the grave acts 
of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, 
including the terrorist attacks in New York, in Pennsylvania, and 
against the Pentagon committed on September 11, 2001, and the continuing 
and immediate threat of further attacks against United States nationals 
or the United States. Because the actions of these persons who commit, 
threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23, 2004. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or 
support terrorism.

Presidential Determination No. 2004-52 of September 24, 2004

Certification Permitting Rescission of Iraq as a Sponsor of Terrorism

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
On September 13, 1990, Acting Secretary of State Eagleburger designated 
Iraq as a state sponsor of terrorism (55 Fed. Reg. 37793-01).
Consistent with section 6(j)(4)(A) of the Export Administration Act of 
1979, Public Law 96-72, as amended, and as continued in effect by 
Executive Order 13222 of August 17, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 44025, I hereby 
certify that:
                                                                     (1)
     There has been a fundamental change in the leadership and policies 
    of the Government of Iraq;
                                                                     (2)
     Iraq's government is not supporting acts of international 
    terrorism; and
                                                                     (3)
     Iraq's government has provided assurances that it will not support 
    acts of international terrorism in the future.
Accordingly, the prerequisites for your determination to rescind Iraq's 
designation as a state sponsor of terrorism will be satisfied once you 
have transmitted this certification to the Congress.
This certification shall also satisfy the provisions of section 
620A(c)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, Public Law 87-195, as 
amended, and section 40(f)(1)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act, Public 
Law 90-629, as amended.
You are authorized and directed to report this certification to the

The admission of up to 70,000 refugees to the United States during FY 2005 
is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national 
interest; provided, however, that this number shall be understood as 
including persons admitted to the United States during FY 2005 with Federal 
refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian immigrant admissions 
program, as provided below.

The 70,000 admissions numbers shall be allocated among refugees of 
special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the 
following regional allocations; provided, however, that the number

assistance under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988, as contained 
in section 101(e) of Public Law 100-202 (Amerasian immigrants and their 
family members); provided further that the number allocated to the 
former Soviet Union shall include persons admitted who were nationals of 
the former Soviet Union, or in the case of persons having no 
nationality, who were habitual residents of the former Soviet Union, 
prior to September 2, 1991:

 
 
 
Africa                                     20,000

Additionally, upon notification to the Judiciary Committees of the 
Congress, you are further authorized to transfer unused numbers 
allocated to a particular region to one or more other regions, if there 
is a need for greater numbers for the region or regions to which the 
numbers are being transferred. Consistent with section 2(b)(2) of the 
Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, I hereby 
determine that assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for 
admission to the United States as part of the

[[Page 297]]

overseas refugee admissions program will contribute to the foreign 
policy interests of the United States and designate such persons for 
this purpose.
An additional 10,000 refugee admissions numbers shall be made available 
during FY 2005 for the adjustment to permanent resident status under 
section 209(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1159(b)) 
of aliens who have been granted asylum in the United States under 
section 208 of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1158), as this is justified by 
humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.
In accordance with section 101(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)), 
and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I also specify 
that, for FY 2005, the following persons may, if otherwise qualified, be

Notice of October 19, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant 
Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant 
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, and the extreme level of 
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States 
and abroad.
The order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the 
United States or within the possession or control of United States 
persons or foreign persons listed in an annex to the order, as well as 
of foreign persons determined to play a significant role in 
international narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia. The order 
similarly blocks all property and interests in property of foreign 
persons determined to materially assist in, or provide financial or 
technological support for or goods or services in support of, the 
narcotics trafficking activities of persons designated in or pursuant to 
the order, or persons determined to be owned or controlled by, or to act 
for or on behalf of, persons designated in or pursuant to the order. The 
order also prohibits any transaction or dealing by United States persons 
or within the United States in such property or interests in property.

[[Page 300]]

Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States and to cause an extreme level of violence, 
corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad, the national 
emergency declared on October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted 
pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect 
beyond October 21, 2004. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics 
traffickers centered in Colombia. This notice shall be published in the 
Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of November 1, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan

On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Sudan pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
the Government of Sudan. Because the actions and policies of the 
Government of Sudan continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on November 3, 1997, and the measures 
adopted on that date to deal with that emergency must continue in effect 
beyond November 3, 2004. Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency with respect to Sudan.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.
GEORGE W. BUSH
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, November 1, 2004.



Notice of November 4, 2004

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, President Clinton 
declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, 
biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the 
means of delivering such weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued 
Executive Order 13094 to amend Executive Order 12938 to respond more 
effectively to the worldwide threat of proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means of delivering such weapons. Because the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering 
them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the 
national emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, must continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 2004. In accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as 
amended.

Notice of November 9, 2004

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in 
Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, 
and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with 
Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2004. Therefore, 
consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year this national emergency with 
respect to Iran.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

    (a) No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may 
not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, 
on the basis of handicap--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified individual with handicaps an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;
    (iii) Provide a qualified individual with handicaps with an aid, 
benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal 
opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to 
reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps

that are as effective as those provided to others;
    (v) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;

separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or 
different programs or activities.
    (3) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other 
arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose 
or effect of which would--
    (i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination

    (6) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification 
program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with handicaps

Sec. 102.140  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 102.141-102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 319]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with 
handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property 
is not required because of Sec. 102.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

[[Page 320]]

apply to buildings covered by this section.


<R05>
Secs. 102.152-102.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.

jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to

from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
