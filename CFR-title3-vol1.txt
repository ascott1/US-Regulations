                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2012), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vii]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
April 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning April 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.

[[Page viii]]

    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this 
volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2011 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2011 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 8622 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2011 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2012, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
  statements, can be found in the Compilation of Presidential Documents 
   and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. A selection of these 
Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
 Division under the supervision of Stacey A. Mulligan. The Chief Editor 
   for the 2011 Compilation was Michael J. Forcina, assisted by Lois M. 
                                                                  Davis.

Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Tucson, Arizona

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence 
perpetrated on Saturday, January 8, 2011, in Tucson, Arizona, by the 
authority vested in me as President of the United States by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby

2011. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the 
same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular

and naval vessels and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8623 of January 14, 2011

Religious Freedom Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation was founded on a shared commitment to the values of justice, 
freedom, and equality. On Religious Freedom Day, we commemorate 
Virginia's 1786 Statute for Religious Freedom, in which Thomas Jefferson 
wrote that ``all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to 
maintain, their opinion in matters of religion.'' The fundamental 
principle of religious freedom--guarded by our Founders and enshrined in 
our Constitution's First Amendment--continues to protect rich faiths 
flourishing within our borders.
The writ of the Founding Fathers has upheld the ability of Americans to 
worship and practice religion as they choose, including the right to 
believe in no religion at all. However, these liberties are not self-
sustaining, and require a stalwart commitment by each generation to 
preserve and apply them. Throughout our Nation's history, our founding 
ideal of religious freedom has served as an example to the world. Though 
our Nation has sometimes fallen short of the weighty task of ensuring 
freedom of religious expression and practice, we have remained a Nation 
in which people of different faiths coexist with mutual respect and 
equality under the law. America's unshakeable commitment to religious 
freedom binds us together as a people, and the strength of our values 
underpins a country that is tolerant, just, and strong.
My Administration continues to defend the cause of religious freedom in 
the United States and around the world. At home, we vigorously protect 
the civil rights of Americans, regardless of their religious beliefs. 
Across the globe, we also seek to uphold this human right and to foster 
tolerance and peace with those whose beliefs differ from our own. We 
bear witness to those who are persecuted or attacked because of their 
faith. We condemn the attacks made in recent months against Christians 
in Iraq and Egypt, along with attacks against people of all backgrounds 
and beliefs. The United States stands with those who advocate for free 
religious expression and works to protect the rights of all people to 
follow their conscience, free from persecution and discrimination.
On Religious Freedom Day, let us reflect on the principle of religious 
freedom that has guided our Nation forward, and recommit to upholding 
this universal human right both at home and around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2011, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day 
with events and activities that teach us about this critical foundation 
of our Nation's liberty, and to show us how we can protect it for future 
generations here and around the world.

Proclamation 8624 of January 14, 2011

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Half a century ago, America was moved by a young preacher who called a 
generation to action and forever changed the course of history. The 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. devoted his life to the struggle 
for justice and equality, sowing seeds of hope for a day when all people 
might claim ``the riches of freedom and the security of justice.'' On 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, we commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of the holiday recognizing one of America's greatest 
visionary leaders, and we celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. King.
Dr. King guided us toward a mountaintop on which all Americans--
regardless of skin color--could live together in mutual respect and 
brotherhood. His bold leadership and prophetic eloquence united people 
of all backgrounds in a noble quest for freedom and basic civil rights. 
Inspired by Dr. King's legacy, brave souls have marched fearlessly, 
organized relentlessly, and devoted their lives to the unending task of 
perfecting our Union. Their courage and dedication have carried us even 
closer to the promised land Dr. King envisioned, but we must recognize 
their achievements as milestones on the long path to true equal 
opportunity and equal rights.
We must face the challenges of today with the same strength, 
persistence, and determination exhibited by Dr. King, guided by the 
enduring values of hope and justice embodied by other civil rights 
leaders. As a country, we must expand access to opportunity and end 
structural inequalities for all people in employment and economic 
mobility. It is our collective responsibility as a great Nation to 
ensure a strong foundation that supports economic security for all and 
extends the founding promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness to every American.
Dr. King devoted his life to serving others, reminding us that ``human 
progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. Every step toward the goal 
of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle--the tireless 
exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.'' 
Commemorating Dr. King's life is not only a tribute to his contributions 
to our Nation and the world, but also a reminder that every day, each of 
us can play a part in continuing this critical work.
For this reason, we honor Dr. King's legacy with a national day of 
service. I encourage all Americans to visit www.MLKDay.gov to learn more 
about service opportunities across our country. By dedicating this day 
to service, we move our Nation closer to Dr. King's vision of all 
Americans living and working together as one beloved community.

NOW, THEREFORE, I BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 17, 2011, as 
the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans 
to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service 
programs in honor of Dr. King's life and lasting legacy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of

Proclamation 8625 of January 31, 2011

American Heart Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Heart disease is a staggering health problem and a leading cause of 
death for American women and men. Thankfully, there are steps each of us 
can take to prevent this chronic disease. In a time when one in three 
adults in the United States is living with some form of cardiovascular 
disease, American Heart Month provides an important reminder that it is 
never too early to take action to improve our heart health.
All Americans should be aware of risk factors that can lead to heart 
disease, including: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, 
obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and family history. 
Practicing everyday habits such as eating a balanced diet, maintaining a 
healthy weight, limiting sodium consumption, exercising regularly, 
avoiding tobacco, and moderating alcohol intake can reduce these risks. 
Each of us can be proactive about our well being, and my Administration 
is committed to helping Americans protect themselves from chronic 
conditions like heart disease. Under the Affordable Care Act, all new 
individual and group health plans must now provide recommended 
preventive care and services without a copayment, coinsurance, or 
deductible. These potentially life-saving screenings include blood 
pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, and body mass index tests, as well as 
counseling on quitting smoking, losing weight, and eating well. To learn 
more about the risk factors and prevention of heart disease, I encourage 
all Americans to visit: www.CDC.gov/HeartDisease.
To save lives in the fight against cardiovascular disease, my 
Administration is investing in world-class research to prevent and treat 
this and other chronic diseases. We are also continuing to raise 
awareness of heart disease and its risk factors among Americans of all 
ages. First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative is safeguarding 
healthier hearts for the next generation by addressing the factors that 
contribute to childhood obesity and its serious health consequences. The 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's The Heart Truth campaign 
sends women of all ages an urgent message about their risk of heart 
disease. In support of women's heart health, I encourage all Americans 
to wear red or the campaign's Red Dress

[[Page 5]]

Pin on National Wear Red Day on Friday, February 4 in honor of the 
movement to increase awareness of women's heart disease. Learn more by 
visiting: www.HeartTruth.gov.
During American Heart Month, we honor the health professionals, 
researchers, and heart health ambassadors whose dedication enables 
countless Americans to live full and active lives. This month, let us 
rededicate ourselves to reducing the burden of heart disease by raising 
awareness, taking steps to improve our own heart health, and encouraging 
our colleagues, friends, and family to do the same.
In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has 
requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating 
February as ``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2011 as American Heart Month, and I 
invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 
4, 2011. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and 
reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8626 of January 31, 2011

National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month reflects 
our Nation's growing understanding that violence within relationships 
often begins during adolescence. Each year, about one in four teens 
report being the victim of verbal, physical, emotional, or sexual 
violence. Abusive relationships can impact adolescent development, and 
teens who experience dating violence may suffer long-term negative 
behavioral and health consequences. Adolescents in controlling or 
violent relationships may carry these dangerous and unhealthy patterns 
into future relationships. The time to break the cycle of teen dating 
violence is now, before another generation falls victim to this tragedy.
Though many communities face the problem of teen dating violence, young 
people can be afraid to discuss it, or they may not recognize the 
severity of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. Parents and other 
adults can also be uncomfortable acknowledging that young people 
experience abuse, or

[[Page 6]]

may be unaware of its occurrence. To help stop abuse before it starts, 
mentors and leaders must stress the importance of mutual respect and 
challenge representations in popular culture that can lead young people 
to accept unhealthy behavior in their relationships.
Our efforts to take on teen dating violence must address the social 
realities of adolescent life today. Technology such as cell phones, 
email, and social networking websites play a major role in many 
teenagers' lives, but these tools are sometimes tragically used for 
control, stalking, and victimization. Emotional abuse using digital 
technology, including frequent text messages, threatening emails, and 
the circulation of embarrassing messages or photographs without consent, 
can be devastating to young teens. I encourage concerned teens, parents, 
and loved ones to contact the National Teen Dating Abuse Helpline at 1-
866-331-9474 or visit www.LoveIsRespect.org to receive immediate and 
confidential advice and referrals.
My Administration is committed to engaging a broad spectrum of community 
partners to curb and prevent teen dating violence. The Department of 
Justice's Office on Violence Against Women supports collaborative 
efforts to enhance teens' understanding of healthy relationships, help 
them identify signs of abuse, and assist them in locating services. 
Resources are available at: www.OVW.USDOJ.gov/teen--dating--
violence.htm. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also 
provide tools to help prevent dating violence among teens. More 
information is available at: www.CDC.gov/ChooseRespect.
During National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month--and 
throughout the year--let each of us resolve to do our part to break the 
silence and create a culture of healthy relationships for all our young 
people. Adults who respect themselves, their partners, and their 
neighbors demonstrate positive behaviors to our children--lessons that 
will help them lead safe and happy lives free from violence.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2011 as 
National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call 
upon all Americans to support efforts in their communities and schools, 
and in their own families, to empower young people to develop healthy 
relationships throughout their lives and to engage in activities that 
prevent and respond to teen dating violence.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day 
of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8627 of February 1, 2011

National African American History Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The great abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglass once told us, ``If 
there is no struggle, there is no progress.'' Progress in America has 
not come easily, but has resulted from the collective efforts of 
generations. For centuries, African American men and women have 
persevered to enrich our national life and bend the arc of history 
toward justice. From resolute Revolutionary War soldiers fighting for 
liberty to the hardworking students of today reaching for horizons their 
ancestors could only have imagined, African Americans have strengthened 
our Nation by leading reforms, overcoming obstacles, and breaking down 
barriers. During National African American History Month, we celebrate 
the vast contributions of African Americans to our Nation's history and 
identity.
This year's theme, ``African Americans and the Civil War,'' invites us 
to reflect on 150 years since the start of the Civil War and on the 
patriots of a young country who fought for the promises of justice and 
equality laid out by our forbearers. In the Emancipation Proclamation, 
President Abraham Lincoln not only extended freedom to those still 
enslaved within rebellious areas, he also opened the door for African 
Americans to join the Union effort.
Tens of thousands of African Americans enlisted in the United States 
Army and Navy, making extraordinary sacrifices to help unite a fractured 
country and free millions from slavery. These gallant soldiers, like 
those in the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, served with 
distinction, braving both intolerance and the perils of war to inspire a 
Nation and expand the domain of freedom. Beyond the battlefield, black 
men and women also supported the war effort by serving as surgeons, 
nurses, chaplains, spies, and in other essential roles. These brave 
Americans gave their energy, their spirit, and sometimes their lives for 
the noble cause of liberty.
Over the course of the next century, the United States struggled to 
deliver fundamental civil and human rights to African Americans, but 
African Americans would not let their dreams be denied. Though Jim Crow 
segregation slowed the onward march of history and expansion of the 
American dream, African Americans braved bigotry and violence to 
organize schools, churches, and neighborhood organizations. Bolstered by 
strong values of faith and community, black men and women have launched 
businesses, fueled scientific advances, served our Nation in the Armed 
Forces, sought public office, taught our children, and created 
groundbreaking works of art and entertainment. To perfect our Union and 
provide a better life for their children, tenacious civil rights 
pioneers have long demanded that America live up to its founding 
principles, and their efforts continue to inspire us.

[[Page 8]]

Though we inherit the extraordinary progress won by the tears and toil 
of our predecessors, we know barriers still remain on the road to equal 
opportunity. Knowledge is our strongest tool against injustice, and it 
is our responsibility to empower every child in America with a world-
class education from cradle to career. We must continue to build on our 
Nation's foundation of freedom and ensure equal opportunity, economic 
security, and civil rights for all Americans. After a historic recession 
has devastated many American families, and particularly African 
Americans, we must continue to create jobs, support our middle class, 
and strengthen pathways for families to climb out of poverty.
During National African American History Month, we recognize the 
extraordinary achievements of African Americans and their essential role 
in shaping the story of America. In honor of their courage and 
contributions, let us resolve to carry forward together the promise of 
America for our children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2011 as 
National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8628 of February 28, 2011

American Red Cross Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For over a century, the American Red Cross has harnessed the generosity 
of the American people, mobilizing us to offer assistance in the wake of 
disaster. Whether aiding towns fighting rising floodwaters or nations 
struggling with starvation and disease, the American Red Cross and its 
international partners have served during crises across the United 
States and around the world. During American Red Cross Month, we 
celebrate our Nation's humanitarian spirit, and we recommit to providing 
relief and hope in times of crisis.
The American Red Cross has a long history of partnering with Presidents 
of the United States to confront the world's most pressing challenges. 
During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson called on our citizens to 
help the American Red Cross ``respond effectively and universally to the 
needs of humanity under stress of war.'' This relationship continued in 
1943, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed March as Red Cross 
Month, urging the public to support the efforts of the American Red 
Cross

[[Page 9]]

to provide resources and medical care to troops, allies, and peoples 
around the world.
 Emergency response organizations like the American Red Cross play a 
vital role in relief operations by deploying scores of volunteers to 
rebuild communities hit by disaster and by providing critical support 
and resources at home and abroad. When a devastating earthquake struck 
Haiti last year, the American people responded with an outpouring of 
compassion, prompting an unprecedented international response and relief 
effort by the American Red Cross. These efforts reflect our country's 
noblest ideals, and they contribute to a climate of international trust 
and cooperation.
Volunteers play an essential part in every American Red Cross effort, 
from traveling to disaster zones around the world to donating blood at 
local community centers. Through their service, ordinary citizens have 
done extraordinary things, upholding the humanitarian mission of service 
and relief organizations and keeping our Nation strong and resilient. 
Though we can never fully know the challenges we will face, American Red 
Cross Month reminds us that Americans will always pull together in times 
of need and will always look to the future with hope and determination.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States, do hereby proclaim March 2011 as American Red Cross 
Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities, and by supporting the work of 
service and relief organizations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8629 of February 28, 2011

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our diverse Nation has been shaped by the sacrifices and successes of 
those who crossed both land and sea in pursuit of a common dream. For 
millions of Americans, this journey began in Ireland. In the wake of the 
Great Hunger, many sons and daughters of Erin came to our shores seeking 
a brighter day, with only courage and the enduring values of faith and 
family to sustain them. Alongside many others who sought a better life 
in a new Nation, these intrepid immigrants built strong communities and 
helped forge our country's future. During Irish-American Heritage Month, 
we honor the contributions Irish Americans have made, and celebrate the 
nearly 40 million among us who proudly trace their roots back to 
Ireland.

[[Page 10]]

From the earliest days of our Republic, the Irish have overcome 
discrimination and carved out a place for themselves in the American 
story. Through hard work, perseverance, and patriotism, women and men of 
Irish descent have given their brawn, brains, and blood to make and 
remake this Nation--pulling it westward, pushing it skyward, and moving 
it forward. Half a century ago, John F. Kennedy became our first Irish-
American Catholic President and summoned an expectant citizenry to 
greatness. This year, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of 
President Kennedy's inauguration, we recognize our 35th President and 
the countless other Irish Americans whose leadership and service have 
steered the course of our Nation.
Seldom in this world has a country so small had so large an impact on 
another. Today, the rich culture of Ireland touches all aspects of 
American society, and the friendship that binds Ireland and the United 
States is marked by a shared past and a common future. As communities 
across our country celebrate Irish-American Heritage Month and St. 
Patrick's Day, our Nation pays tribute to the proud lineage passed down 
to so many Americans from the Emerald Isle.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2011 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by celebrating the contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8630 of February 28, 2011

Women's History Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Women's History Month, we reflect on the extraordinary 
accomplishments of women and honor their role in shaping the course of 
our Nation's history. Today, women have reached heights their mothers 
and grandmothers might only have imagined. Women now comprise nearly 
half of our workforce and the majority of students in our colleges and 
universities. They scale the skies as astronauts, expand our economy as 
entrepreneurs and business leaders, and serve our country at the highest 
levels of government and our Armed Forces. In honor of the pioneering 
women who came before us, and in recognition of those who will come 
after us, this month, we recommit to erasing the remaining inequities 
facing women in our day.
This year, we commemorate the 100th anniversary of International Women's 
Day, a global celebration of the economic, political, and social 
achievements of women past, present, and future. International Women's 
Day is

[[Page 11]]

a chance to pay tribute to ordinary women throughout the world and is 
rooted in women's centuries-old struggle to participate in society on an 
equal footing with men. This day reminds us that, while enormous 
progress has been made, there is still work to be done before women 
achieve true parity.
My Administration has elevated the rights of women and girls abroad as a 
critical aspect of our foreign and national security policy. Empowering 
women across the globe is not simply the right thing to do, it is also 
smart foreign policy. This knowledge is reflected in the National 
Security Strategy of the United States, which recognizes that countries 
are more peaceful and prosperous when their female citizens enjoy equal 
rights, equal voices, and equal opportunities. Today, we are integrating 
a focus on women and girls in all our diplomatic efforts, and 
incorporating gender considerations in every aspect of our development 
assistance. We are working to build the participation of women into all 
aspects of conflict prevention and resolution, and we are continuing to 
lead in combating the scourge of conflict-related sexual violence, both 
bilaterally and at the United Nations.
In America, we must lead by example in protecting women's rights and 
supporting their empowerment. Despite our progress, too many women 
continue to be paid less than male workers, and women are significantly 
underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) fields. By tapping into the potential and talents of 
all our citizens, we can utilize an enormous source of economic growth 
and prosperity. The White House Council on Women and Girls has continued 
to remove obstacles to achievement by addressing the rate of violence 
against women, supporting female entrepreneurs, and prioritizing the 
economic security of women. American families depend largely on the 
financial stability of women, and my Administration continues to 
prioritize policies that promote workplace flexibility, access to 
affordable, quality health care and child care, support for family 
caregivers, and the enforcement of equal pay laws. I have also called on 
every agency in the Federal Government to be part of the solution to 
ending violence against women, and they have responded with 
unprecedented cooperation to protect victims of domestic and sexual 
violence and enable survivors to break the cycle of abuse.
As we reflect on the triumphs of the past, we must also look to the 
limitless potential that lies ahead. To win the future, we must equip 
the young women of today with the knowledge, skills, and equal access to 
reach for the promise of tomorrow. My Administration is making 
unprecedented investments in education and is working to expand 
opportunities for women and girls in the STEM fields critical for growth 
in the 21st-century economy.
As we prepare to write the next chapter of women's history, let us 
resolve to build on the progress won by the trailblazers of the past. We 
must carry forward the work of the women who came before us and ensure 
our daughters have no limits on their dreams, no obstacles to their 
achievements, and no remaining ceilings to shatter.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2011 as Women's

[[Page 12]]

History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month and to 
celebrate International Women's Day on March 8, 2011 with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the history, 
accomplishments, and contributions of American women. I also invite all 
Americans to visit www.WomensHistoryMonth.gov to learn more about the 
generations of women who have shaped our history.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8631 of February 28, 2011

50th Anniversary of the Peace Corps

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed an Executive Order 
establishing the Peace Corps, forever changing the way America sees the 
world and the world sees us. Today, one of President Kennedy's most 
enduring legacies can be found in the over 200,000 current and returned 
Peace Corps Volunteers who have collectively given over a half-century 
of service to the cause of peace. On its 50th anniversary, the United 
States Peace Corps remains an enduring symbol of our Nation's commitment 
to encouraging progress, creating opportunity, and fostering mutual 
respect and understanding throughout the world.
Over the past five decades, Peace Corps Volunteers have served in nearly 
140 countries, bringing a wealth of practical assistance to those 
working to build better lives for themselves and their communities. From 
the first group of volunteers to arrive in Ghana and Tanzania in August 
1961, they have been emissaries of hope and goodwill to the far corners 
of our world, strengthening the ties of friendship between the people of 
the United States and those of other countries. Living and working 
alongside those they serve, volunteers help address changing and complex 
global needs in education, health and HIV/AIDS, business and information 
technology, agriculture, environmental protection, and youth 
development. With each village that now has access to clean water, each 
young woman who has received an education, and each family empowered to 
prevent disease because of the service of a Peace Corps Volunteer, 
President Kennedy's noble vision lives on.
In our increasingly interconnected world, the mission of the Peace Corps 
is more relevant today than ever. Returned volunteers, enriched by their 
experiences overseas, bring a deeper understanding of other cultures and 
traditions back to their home communities in the United States. The 
lasting accomplishments of the Peace Corps continue to strengthen 
partnerships with leaders and countries around the world. This year, we 
also mourn the loss and pay tribute to the extraordinary life of Sargent 
Shriver, the founding director of the Peace Corps. The impact of his 
decades of public service

[[Page 13]]

will echo forever in countless places across the globe that have been 
touched by the Peace Corps.
On this anniversary, we honor the men and women from across the country 
who have carried forward our Nation's finest tradition of service, and 
we rededicate ourselves to fulfilling the dream and continuing the work 
of all those who aspire and yearn for peace.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1, 2011, as the 
50th Anniversary of the Peace Corps. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities 
that honor the Peace Corps and its volunteers, past and present, for 
their many contributions to the cause of global peace and friendship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day

Proclamation 8633 of March 1, 2011

Read Across America Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Hidden in the pages of books are extraordinary worlds and characters 
that can spark creativity and imagination, and unlock the potential that 
lies within each of our children. Reading is the foundation upon which 
all other learning is built, and on Read Across America Day, we reaffirm 
our commitment to supporting America's next generation of great readers.
Cultivation of basic literacy skills can begin early and in the home. It 
is family who first instills the love of learning in our future leaders 
by engaging children in good reading habits and making reading a fun and 
interactive activity. Regardless of language or literacy level, every 
adult can inspire young people to appreciate the written word early in 
life. Parents and mentors can help build fundamental skills by reading 
aloud to children regularly, discussing the story, and encouraging 
children to ask questions on words or content they do not understand. By 
passing a passion for literature on to our sons and daughters, we 
prepare them to be lifelong, successful readers, and we provide them 
with an essential skill necessary for academic achievement.
Teachers also play an integral role in our students' lives, and 
educators can help prepare our children to meet the challenges of 
tomorrow by making reading a key component of classroom activities. Our 
Nation's young people rely on the critical thinking and analytical 
skills gained from reading to build other areas of knowledge, including 
the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The 
next generation's ability to excel in these disciplines is crucial to 
America's strength and prosperity in the 21st century.
Read Across America Day marks the birthday of Theodor Seuss Geisel, 
better known to the world as Dr. Seuss. Through amusing wordplay and 
engaging tales, his stories have helped generations of young Americans 
enjoy reading and sharpen basic reading skills, vital tools for their 
future success. With parents, teachers, and communities working 
together, we can ensure reading is a national priority and American 
pastime. By recommitting to improving literacy and raising the 
expectations we have for our students, for our schools, and for 
ourselves, we will win the future for our children and give every child 
a chance to succeed.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2, 2011, as Read 
Across America Day. I call upon children, families, educators, 
librarians, public officials, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8634 of March 4, 2011

National Consumer Protection Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each day, families across America navigate complex financial decisions, 
from buying a home or car to paying off a loan or using a credit card. 
Consumer education is vital to protecting American families and 
preserving economic health in the United States. When fully informed 
about the potential risks in the marketplace and their rights as 
consumers, Americans are better able to recognize misinformation, scams, 
and abusive and deceptive practices that can endanger individual 
economic security and erode the prosperity of our communities.
For more than a decade, National Consumer Protection Week has encouraged 
Americans to make better-informed decisions about saving, buying, 
borrowing, and investing. This year's theme, ``Your Information 
Destination: www.NCPW.gov,'' highlights the resources offered by Federal 
agencies and partner organizations that encourage the public to manage 
their money, stay safe online, and understand mortgages and other 
financial transactions. By seeking out this information, families can 
both strengthen the economy and protect themselves from fraudulent 
behavior. For information and resources, I encourage American consumers 
to visit www.NCPW.gov.
The Federal Government has an important role to play in safeguarding 
transactions, and my Administration is committed to holding abusive 
companies accountable and shifting the balance of power back to the 
American consumer. I was proud to sign into law the strongest consumer 
protections in our Nation's history with the Credit Card Accountability, 
Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (Credit CARD Act) and the Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One of the centerpieces 
of this financial reform legislation was the creation of the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau, which is charged with enforcing historic 
financial protections and empowering Americans with clear and concise 
information to make the best choices for their families. These common-
sense reforms will protect both consumers and our economy as a whole.
As a Nation, we must foster an environment that supports informed 
decisionmaking, supports fair and robust competition in the marketplace, 
and guards all citizens from unfair and predatory practices. During 
National Consumer Protection Week, I encourage all Americans to learn 
about their rights as consumers and seek out the knowledge to manage 
their finances more effectively by visiting www.MyMoney.gov and 
www.ConsumerFinance.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 6 through March 
12, 2011, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government 
officials, industry leaders, and advocates across the Nation to share 
information about consumer protection and provide our citizens with 
information about their rights as consumers.

Proclamation 8635 of March 4, 2011

Save Your Vision Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across America, millions of men and women experience vision loss or are 
affected by low vision or blindness. During Save Your Vision Week, we 
reinforce the importance of routine eye care and remind all Americans to 
take action to safeguard their eyesight.
Vision is important to our everyday activities, and we can all take 
steps to protect and prolong our eye health. Through Healthy People 
2020, the Department of Health and Human Services' science-based agenda 
to prevent disease and promote health, our country's leading health 
officials have identified interventions to preserve sight and prevent 
blindness. Though some eye diseases and injuries are preventable or 
treatable with early detection and timely treatment, many Americans do 
not receive recommended eye exams and screenings. Healthy People 2020 
advises each American to get vision check-ups regularly in order to 
identify vision impairments at an early stage. For more information 
about eye health or help finding an eye care professional, I encourage 
all Americans to visit: www.NEI.NIH.gov.
Preventive eye care, including wearing ultraviolet-protective eyewear 
and following good eating habits, can help support a healthy and active 
lifestyle at any age. By seeking out information and taking action to 
protect healthy vision--and encouraging others to do so as well--all 
Americans can help preserve the precious gift of sight.
To remind Americans of the importance of safeguarding their eyesight, 
the United States Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 
1963, as amended (77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and 
requested the President to proclaim the first week in March of each year 
as ``Save Your Vision Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 6 through March 12, 2011, as Save Your 
Vision Week. During this time, I invite eye care professionals, 
teachers, members of the media, and all organizations dedicated to 
preserving eyesight to join in activities that will raise awareness of 
eye and vision health.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8636 of March 4, 2011

150th Anniversary of the Inauguration of Abraham Lincoln

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

President Abraham Lincoln is revered in American history as the leader 
who held together a fractured country and liberated millions from 
slavery. His words are memorized by America's schoolchildren, and his 
name is synonymous with freedom and unity. One hundred fifty years ago, 
on March 4, 1861, this self-taught man, rugged rail-splitter, and humble 
lawyer from Springfield, Illinois, was sworn in as our Nation's 16th 
President under an unfinished dome of the United States Capitol, with 
the storm clouds of civil war gathering.
President Lincoln reminded us in his Inaugural Address that America's 
Union was much older than the Constitution itself, and that our national 
fabric had been stitched together by shared memories and common hopes. 
As we observe the 150th anniversary of his Inauguration, we reflect on 
his unceasing belief and our enduring faith that we remain one Nation 
and one people, sharing a bond as Americans that will never break.
Through simple eloquence and humble leadership marked by profound 
wisdom--both on his Inauguration day and throughout the coming 
conflict--President Lincoln charted a course to transcend our discord 
and bind the wounds of a severed country. From the principles he set 
forth in the Emancipation Proclamation to his transformative address on 
the fields of Gettysburg, President Lincoln showed us how to preserve 
and perfect ``the last, best hope of Earth.'' His actions and his memory 
enabled America to move beyond a young collection of States to become a 
free and unified Nation, striving for the promises and principles for 
which so many fought and died.
Our revered 16th President taught us that we are more than North and 
South, black and white--we are one, and we are all Americans. The forces 
that divide us are not stronger than the forces that unite us, and the 
``new birth of freedom'' President Lincoln called for still echoes in 
each of our hearts. Today, we live in the Union he saved, inheritors of 
the freedoms and progress for which he served. Through the ages, Abraham 
Lincoln calls us to take a renewed devotion to the unfinished work 
remaining before our Nation--joining together across all divides to 
ensure that ``government of the people, by the people, for the people'' 
endures in our time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 4, 2011, as a 
day to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Inauguration of Abraham 
Lincoln. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor his memory and uphold 
the principles he so nobly advanced.

Proclamation 8637 of March 16, 2011

150th Anniversary of the Unification of Italy, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On March 17, Italy celebrates the 150th anniversary of its unification 
as a single state. On this day, we join with Italians everywhere to 
honor the courage, sacrifice, and vision of the patriots who gave birth 
to the Italian nation. At a time when the United States was fighting for 
the preservation of our own Union, Giuseppe Garibaldi's campaign for the 
unification of Italy inspired many around the world in their own 
struggles, including the 39th New York Infantry, also known as ``The 
Garibaldi Guard.'' Today, the legacy of Garibaldi and all those who 
unified Italy lives on in the millions of American women and men of 
Italian descent who strengthen and enrich our Nation.
Italy and the United States are bound by friendship and common 
dedication to civil liberties, democratic principles, and the universal 
human rights our countries both respect and uphold. As we mark this 
important milestone in Italian history, we also honor the joint efforts 
of Americans and Italians to foster freedom, democracy, and our shared 
values throughout the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 17, 2011, as a 
day to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Unification of Italy. I 
encourage all Americans to learn more about the history of Italian 
unification and to honor the enduring friendship between the people of 
Italy and the people of the United States.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8638 of March 18, 2011

National Poison Prevention Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each day, emergency rooms treat nearly 2,000 Americans for accidental 
poisonings, and dozens die as a result of ingesting, inhaling, or 
otherwise exposing themselves to poisonous substances. In many cases, 
these tragic incidents are preventable. During National Poison 
Prevention Week, I encourage all Americans to identify possible dangers 
in the home, take action to address poisoning hazards, and learn how to 
respond if a poison emergency should occur.
Children are particularly susceptible to unintentional poisoning. More 
than half of all reported poison exposures involve children under the 
age of six, and many occur when unsupervised children find and consume 
medicines or harmful chemicals. Unintentional poisonings among young 
people often occur when misusing or abusing prescription medications 
such as pain killers, sedatives, and stimulants taken from a home 
medicine cabinet. Parents and caregivers can help prevent these injuries 
by taking simple steps to secure medications and other dangerous 
materials including resealing child-resistant containers, placing drugs 
and toxic chemicals out of reach of children, and storing all these 
products in locked or childproof cabinets.
Sadly, death rates from unintentional poisonings have increased steadily 
in recent years. Many adult poisonings stem from accidental or 
intentional exposure to over-the-counter or prescription drugs. These 
can be avoided by reading labels before taking medications, storing 
medicines in their original containers, and safely disposing of unused 
prescription medication. These actions can reduce the risk posed by 
medications with abuse potential. All Americans can help prevent 
needless harm from hazardous materials by becoming more aware of the 
dangers of poisonings and the ways we can prevent and respond to these 
incidents.
In the event of an accidental poisoning, quick action can prevent 
serious injury and save lives. If confronted with a suspected poisoning, 
individuals should call the national poison control hotline at 1-800-
222-1222. I encourage families to post this number near their home 
telephone, which connects callers to potentially life-saving information 
at local and regional poison control centers 24 hours a day, seven days 
a week.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 20 through March 26, 2011, as 
``National Poison Prevention Week.'' I call upon all Americans to 
observe this week by taking actions to protect their families from 
hazardous household materials and from misuse of prescription 
medications.

Proclamation 8639 of March 24, 2011

100th Anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On March 25, 1911, a fire spread through the cramped floors of the 
Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in lower Manhattan. Flames spread quickly 
through the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors--overcrowded, littered with cloth 
scraps, and containing few buckets of water to douse the flames--giving 
the factory workers there little time to escape. When the panicked 
workers tried to flee, they encountered locked doors and broken fire 
escapes, and were trapped by long tables and bulky machines. As 
bystanders watched in horror, young workers began jumping out of the 
windows to escape the inferno, falling helplessly to their deaths on the 
street below.
By the time the fire was extinguished, nearly 150 individuals had 
perished in an avoidable tragedy. The exploited workers killed that day 
were mostly young women, recent immigrants of Jewish and Italian 
descent. The catastrophe sent shockwaves through New York City and the 
immigrant communities of Manhattan's Lower East Side, where families 
struggled to recognize the charred remains of their loved ones in 
makeshift morgues. The last victims were officially identified just this 
year.
A century later, we reflect not only on the tragic loss of these young 
lives, but also on the movement they inspired. The Triangle factory fire 
was a galvanizing moment, calling American leaders to reexamine their 
approach to workplace conditions and the purpose of unions. The fire 
awakened the conscience of our Nation, inspiring sweeping improvements 
to safety regulations both in New York and across the United States. The 
tragedy strengthened the potency of organized labor, which gave voice to 
previously powerless workers. A witness to the fire, Frances Perkins 
carried the gruesome images of that day through a lifetime of advocacy 
for American workers and into her role as the Secretary of Labor and our 
country's first female Cabinet Secretary.
Despite the enormous progress made since the Triangle factory fire, we 
are still fighting to provide adequate working conditions for all women 
and men on the job, ensure no person within our borders is exploited for 
their labor, and uphold collective bargaining as a tool to give workers 
a seat at the tables of power. Working Americans are the backbone of our 
communities and power the engine of our economy. As we mark the 
anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, let us resolve to 
renew the urgency that tragedy inspired and recommit to our shared 
responsibility to provide a safe environment for all American workers.

[[Page 21]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2011, as the 
100th Anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. I call upon 
all Americans to participate in ceremonies and activities in memory of 
those who have been killed due to unsafe working conditions.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8640 of March 24, 2011

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One hundred ninety years ago, Greece regained its independence and 
became a symbol of democracy for the world for the second time in 
history. As America recognizes this milestone in the birthplace of 
democracy, we also celebrate our warm friendship with Greece and the 
lasting legacy of Hellenic culture in our own country.
America's Founders drew upon the core democratic principles developed in 
ancient Greece as they imagined a new government. Since that time, our 
Union has strived to uphold the belief that each person has a 
fundamental right to liberty and participation in the democratic 
process, and Greece has continued to promote those very principles. Over 
the centuries these cherished ideals--democracy, equality, and freedom--
have inspired our citizens and the world.
The relationship between the United States and Greece extends beyond our 
common values and is strengthened by the profound influence of Greek 
culture on our national life. From the architecture of our historic 
buildings to the lessons in philosophy and literature passed on in our 
classrooms, America has drawn on the deep intellectual traditions of the 
Greeks in our own establishment and growth as a nation. Reinforcing the 
steadfast bonds between our two countries, Americans of Greek descent 
have maintained the best of their heritage and immeasurably enriched our 
national character.
The American people stand with Greece to honor the legacy of democracy 
wrought over 2,000 years ago and its restoration to the Hellenic 
Republic nearly 200 years ago. As we celebrate the history and values of 
Greece and the United States, we also look forward to our shared future 
and recommit to continuing our work as friends and allies.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 22]]

the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2011, as 
Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy. I call upon all the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the

Proclamation 8641 of March 30, 2011

Cesar Chavez Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's story of progress is rich with profound struggle and great 
sacrifice, marked by the selfless acts and fearless leadership of 
remarkable Americans. A true champion for justice, Cesar Chavez 
advocated for and won many of the rights and benefits we now enjoy, and 
his spirit lives on in the hands and hearts of working women and men 
today. As we celebrate the anniversary of his birth, we honor Cesar 
Chavez's lasting victories for American workers and his noble methods in 
achieving them.
Raised in the fields of Arizona and California, Cesar Chavez faced 
hardship and injustice from a young age. At the time, farm workers 
toiled in the shadows of society, vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. 
Families like Chavez's were impoverished; exposed to hazardous working 
conditions and dangerous pesticides; and often denied clean drinking 
water, toilets, and other basic necessities.
Cesar Chavez saw the need for change and made a courageous choice to 
work to improve the lives of his fellow farm workers. Through boycotts 
and fasts, he led others on a path of nonviolence conceived in careful 
study of the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi and Mahatma Gandhi, and 
in the powerful example of Martin Luther King, Jr. He became a community 
organizer and began his lifelong advocacy to protect and empower people. 
With quiet leadership and a powerful voice, Cesar founded the United 
Farm Workers (UFW) with Dolores Huerta, launching one of our Nation's 
most inspiring social movements.
Cesar Chavez's legacy provides lessons from which all Americans can 
learn. One person can change the course of a nation and improve the 
lives of countless individuals. Cesar once said, ``Non-violence is not 
inaction. . . . Non-violence is hard work. It is the willingness to 
sacrifice. It is the patience to win.'' From his inspiring 
accomplishments, we have learned that social justice takes action, 
selflessness, and commitment. As we face the challenges of our day, let 
us do so with the hope and determination of Cesar Chavez, echoing the 
words that were his rallying cry and that continue to inspire so many 
today, ``S[iacute], se puede'' -- ``Yes, we can.''

[[Page 23]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31 of each year 
as Cesar Chavez Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate service, community, and educational programs to honor Cesar 
Chavez's enduring legacy.

Proclamation 8642 of March 31, 2011

National Donate Life Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans have always been a generous people, willing to give to others 
in need. In these challenging times, that spirit of service has been 
abundantly evident and has made a real difference in many lives. As we 
observe National Donate Life Month, we reflect on an important 
opportunity to aid others--bestowing the gift of life through organ and 
tissue donation.
More than 110,000 individuals are now on the national waiting list for 
organ transplants, and the list continues to grow. Each year, the number 
of Americans needing life-saving donations has far outstripped the 
number of available donors. As a result, people lose their lives each 
day while waiting.
When each donation can touch dozens of lives, it has never been more 
important to make the decision to be an organ and tissue donor. I 
encourage all Americans to say yes to donation by giving blood regularly 
and joining their State-based donor registry. Individuals can register 
online or through the registration or renewal process for a driver's 
license or identification card. When considering organ donation, 
Americans should consult their family members, doctor, or faith leader 
about the decision to donate life. To find out more about donation and 
how you can register in your State, be sure to visit: 
www.OrganDonor.gov.
Together, we can all make the choice to save and improve the lives of 
Americans across our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2011 as National 
Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, 
educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and 
private organizations to join forces to boost the number of organ and 
tissue donors throughout our Nation.

Proclamation 8643 of March 31, 2011

National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation must continue to confront rape and other forms of sexual 
violence as a deplorable crime. Too many victims suffer unaided, and too 
many offenders elude justice. As we mark National Sexual Assault 
Awareness and Prevention Month, we recommit to building a society where 
no woman, man, or child endures the fear of assault or the pain of an 
attack on their physical well-being and basic human dignity.
Despite reforms to our legal system, sexual violence remains pervasive 
and largely misunderstood. Nearly one in six American women will 
experience an attempted or completed rape at some point in her life, and 
for some groups, rates of sexual violence are even higher. Almost one in 
three American Indian and Alaska Native women will be sexually 
assaulted. Young women ages 16 to 24 are at greatest risk, and an 
alarming number of young women are sexually assaulted while in college. 
Too many men and boys are also affected. With each new victim and each 
person still suffering from an attack, we are called with renewed 
purpose to respond to and rid our Nation of all forms of sexual 
violence.
Sexual assault is considered to be the most underreported violent crime 
in America, and criminal justice responses vary widely across our 
country. Some communities have developed highly trained, coordinated 
teams who understand the nature of sexual assault and can respond with 
compassionate understanding. In other places, victims hesitate to report 
these crimes because they fear the criminal justice system will respond 
with skepticism or fail to bring the perpetrator to justice. We must 
ensure our police, prosecutors, and courts treat victims with the 
seriousness and respect they need and deserve. We must do more to 
provide services that help victims recover from the trauma of sexual 
assault. And ultimately, we must prevent sexual assault before it 
happens.
Under Vice President Joe Biden's leadership, my Administration is 
committed to engaging a broad spectrum of Federal agencies and community 
partners to prevent sexual assault, support victims, and hold offenders 
accountable. The Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against 
Women is leading the Sexual Assault Demonstration Initiative to improve 
the way sexual assault survivors are served. The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention is funding innovative prevention campaigns that 
engage bystanders in reducing sexual assault, and the Department of 
Education is working to combat sexual violence at schools and 
universities. We will

[[Page 25]]

continue to support new approaches that show promise in changing 
cultural attitudes toward sexual violence and preventing these crimes.
Each victim of sexual assault represents a sister or a daughter, a 
nephew or a friend. We must break the silence so no victim anguishes 
without resources or aid in their time of greatest need. We must 
continue to reinforce that America will not tolerate sexual violence 
within our borders. Likewise, we will partner with countries across the 
globe as we work toward a common vision of a world free from the threat 
of sexual violence, including as a tool of conflict. Working together, 
we can reduce the incidence of sexual assault and heal lives that have 
already been devastated by this terrible crime.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2011 as National 
Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to 
support victims and work together to prevent these crimes in their 
communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8644 of March 31, 2011

National Cancer Control Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Over the past several decades, our Nation has made significant advances 
in the fight against cancer. Improvements in early detection and 
treatment of this disease have led to decreases in the rates of new 
cases and deaths, and many people who are diagnosed with cancer are 
living longer, with better quality of life. Despite the breadth of our 
progress, an estimated 1.5 million people were diagnosed with cancer 
last year, and more than half a million Americans lost their lives to 
the disease. During National Cancer Control Month, we renew our 
commitment to increasing awareness about cancer and reducing the burden 
of this devastating illness.
There are simple steps all of us can take to protect ourselves and our 
loved ones from cancer. Americans can help reduce their cancer risk with 
healthy practices such as avoiding excessive sun exposure, limiting 
alcohol intake, eating a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, 
and making physical activity part of each day. Exposure to tobacco 
smoke, even from occasional smoking or secondhand smoke, is particularly 
harmful. Americans striving to quit can receive help by calling 1-800-
QUIT-NOW or visiting: www.Smokefree.gov.
Screening tests can also help reduce the risk of developing certain 
cancers and help detect the disease early when it is often easier to 
treat. Under the

[[Page 26]]

Affordable Care Act, new health insurance plans must offer certain 
screening tests, including Pap tests, mammograms, and colonoscopies, at 
no extra cost. I encourage every man and woman to talk with a health 
professional about available testing and when to begin screenings. All 
Americans can visit www.Cancer.gov for more information about the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer.
My Administration is committed to continuing the advances made in cancer 
research, prevention, detection, and treatment. The Healthy People 2020 
initiative, which is spearheaded by the Department of Health and Human 
Services, is tasked with outlining national objectives and benchmarks to 
measure progress toward improving the health of all Americans. The goals 
will provide a roadmap for better health and help focus our Nation's 
attention on trends in cancer rates, mortality, and survival.
Americans of every background have been touched by cancer, either 
through a personal diagnosis or that of a family member or friend, and 
too many of us understand the terrible toll of this disease. In memory 
of loved ones lost to cancer, and in tribute to the survivors and those 
still fighting this disease, I call on all Americans to recognize what 
each of us can do to live longer, healthier lives and to reach for a 
future free from cancer.
The Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved March 
28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103), as amended, has requested the 
President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April as ``Cancer 
Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 2011 as National Cancer Control Month. 
I encourage citizens, Government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control 
cancer.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's children are our hope for the future, and caring for them 
is one of our greatest responsibilities. During National Child Abuse 
Prevention Month, we renew our commitment to preventing child abuse and 
neglect by promoting healthy families, protecting children, and 
supporting communities throughout our Nation.
Although a strong family unit is the best deterrent to child abuse, 
effectively intervening in the lives of children threatened by abuse is 
a shared responsibility. Strengthening the bonds within families 
requires community

[[Page 27]]

members and leaders to partner with parents. From schools to local 
social service agencies, we can work together to protect the well-being 
of our children by recognizing the signs of violence and creating safe, 
stable, and nurturing environments that safeguard the promise of their 
futures.
My Administration will continue to reinforce initiatives that enhance 
the efforts of child protective service agencies to prevent and treat 
child abuse. Last December, I was pleased to sign into law the CAPTA 
(Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment) Reauthorization Act of 2010, 
giving States and local authorities new tools to identify and address 
abuse and neglect. This Act will also bolster prevention efforts by 
addressing risk factors for mistreatment like substance abuse, mental 
illness, and domestic violence. We are also supporting programs that 
expand coordination of early childhood services in order to improve 
outcomes for young children.
As a Nation, we must continue our work to ensure all children have the 
ability to live free from abuse and neglect by advocating for the safety 
of all young people. For more information about what families and 
communities can do to overcome this devastating problem, concerned 
Americans can visit: www.ChildWelfare.gov/Preventing.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2011 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month with programs and activities that help prevent child abuse and 
provide for children's physical, emotional, and developmental needs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the

Proclamation 8646 of March 31, 2011

National Financial Literacy Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans' ability to build a secure future for themselves and their 
families requires the navigation of an increasingly complex financial 
system. As we recover from the worst economic crisis in generations, it 
is more important than ever to be knowledgeable about the consequences 
of our financial decisions. During National Financial Literacy Month, we 
recommit to improving financial literacy and ensuring all Americans have 
access to trustworthy financial services and products.
The financial crisis was fueled by a lack of responsibility from Wall 
Street to Washington. It devastated ordinary Americans, many of whom 
were caught by hidden fees and penalties or saddled with loans they 
could not afford. Preventing a recurrence will require both better 
behavior and oversight on Wall Street and more informed decisionmaking 
on Main Street and

[[Page 28]]

in homes across our country. To lay the foundation for continued 
prosperity, we must expand the availability of financial products and 
services that are fair, affordable, understandable, and reliable. We 
must also strive to ensure all Americans have the skills to manage their 
fiscal resources effectively and avoid deceptive or predatory practices.
Building on the important protections in the Credit Card Accountability, 
Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act, which I signed into law last year, will 
help restore financial stability by enforcing the strongest consumer 
financial protections in history. This Act created the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau, an agency with one job--to look out for the 
interests of Americans as they interact with the financial system. My 
Administration also established the President's Advisory Council on 
Financial Capability to assist the American people in understanding and 
addressing financial matters and to identify effective approaches to 
increase financial capability through education and access. 
Additionally, the National Strategy for Financial Literacy provides a 
new framework for strategic coordination and an overarching financial 
literacy strategy.
While our Government is taking decisive action to promote financial 
stability, our Nation's prosperity will ultimately depend on our 
willingness as individuals to empower ourselves and our families with 
financial knowledge. For more information on improving financial 
literacy, concerned individuals may visit www.MyMoney.gov or 
www.ConsumerFinance.gov, or call toll-free 1-888-MyMoney for guidance 
and resources.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2011 as National 
Financial Literacy Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month with programs and activities to improve their understanding of 
financial principles and practices.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8647 of April 1, 2011

World Autism Awareness Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

With autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) affecting nearly one percent of 
children in the United States, autism is an urgent public health issue 
with a profound impact on millions of Americans. World Autism Awareness 
Day is an opportunity to recognize the contributions of individuals with 
ASDs and rededicate ourselves to the cause of understanding and 
responding to autism.

[[Page 29]]

Men and women on the autism spectrum have thrived and excelled in 
communities across America and around the world. Yet, despite great 
progress in understanding ASDs, challenges remain for these individuals 
and their loved ones. For too long, the needs of people living with 
autism and their families have gone without adequate support and 
understanding. While we continue to encourage the development of 
resources for children on the autism spectrum and provide necessary 
resources for their families, we must also remember that young people 
with ASDs become adults with ASDs who deserve our support, our respect, 
and the opportunity to realize their highest aspirations.
As our understanding of the autism spectrum grows, my Administration 
remains dedicated to supporting children and adults impacted by autism. 
Led by the Department of Health and Human Services, we have expanded 
investments in autism research, public health tracking, early detection, 
and services--from early intervention for children to improved long-term 
services and support programs for adults. My Administration maintains a 
firm commitment to advance autism research and treatment, as well as 
promote education, employment, and equality for all individuals with 
autism, from early childhood through employment and community life. We 
will continue to work with the Congress, experts, and families to 
improve Federal and State programs that assist individuals with ASDs and 
their families and to bolster the impact and reach of community support 
and services. I encourage all Americans to visit www.HHS.gov/autism for 
more information and resources on ASDs.
With each breakthrough in research and each innovative treatment, we 
open endless possibilities for the many American families who have been 
touched by autism. As we mark World Autism Awareness Day, let us 
recommit to improving the lives of individuals and families impacted by 
ASDs and creating a world free from discrimination where all can achieve 
their fullest potential.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2 of each year 
as World Autism Awareness Day. I call upon the people of the United 
States to learn more about autism and what they can do to support 
individuals on the autism spectrum and their families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8648 of April 6, 2011

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we must work to raise a drug-free and healthy generation of 
21st-century leaders. Substance abuse and its consequences have grave 
impacts on our society--destroying lives, tearing apart families, and 
introducing drug-related violence to our neighborhoods. Young Americans 
especially need the help and support of caring adults to resist pressure 
to use drugs or engage in other harmful activities.
We must address the use of illegal drugs, tobacco, and alcohol, as well 
as prescription drug abuse, among youth by building knowledge of the 
warning signs and risks associated with substance abuse. Though parents 
must take the lead in teaching the value of drug-free living, friends, 
mentors, teachers, and neighbors also have roles to play in helping 
adolescents understand the dangers of alcohol and drug addiction. By 
joining together to tackle this issue and encourage positive behavior, 
communities can help young people reject the pressure to try illicit 
substances or engage in other hazardous activity. I encourage students, 
caregivers, and other concerned individuals to visit www.DrugAbuse.gov 
for educational materials on the health effects and consequences of drug 
abuse and addiction.
Law enforcement is often a critical partner in implementing community-
based drug abuse prevention strategies. The Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education (D.A.R.E.) program, in addition to many other prevention 
efforts across our country, serves as a resource in helping educate 
young people on how to resist peer pressure and refrain from drug use 
and violence.
My Administration is committed to reducing drug use and its consequences 
through a balanced approach that includes prevention, treatment, and law 
enforcement, and we are supporting national efforts to prevent drug use 
before it starts. As we work to reduce substance abuse and the great 
damage it causes in our communities, we will make our country stronger 
and our people healthier and safer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 7, 2011, as 
National D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day 
with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8649 of April 7, 2011

National Volunteer Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's story has been marked by the service of volunteers. 
Generations of selfless individuals from all walks of life have served 
each other and our Nation, each person dedicated to making tomorrow 
better than today. They exemplify the quintessential American idea that 
we can change things, make things better, and solve problems when we 
work together.
Volunteers are the lifeblood of our schools and shelters, hospitals and 
hotlines, and faith-based and community groups. From mentoring at-risk 
youth and caring for older Americans to supporting our veterans and 
military families and rebuilding after disasters, these everyday heroes 
make a real and lasting impact on the lives of millions of women and men 
across the globe.
Last year, nearly 63 million Americans gave of themselves through 
service. Their compassion is a testament to the generosity of the 
American spirit. In difficult times, Americans are coming together--
tackling our challenges instead of ignoring them--and renewing the 
principle that we are our brother's keeper and our sister's keeper.
Today, as many Americans face hardship, we need volunteers more than 
ever. Service opportunities tap the energy and ingenuity of our greatest 
resource--the American people--to improve our neighborhoods and our 
world. My Administration is committed to investing in community 
solutions and increasing opportunities for Americans to serve. The 
bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act strengthened the programs 
of the Corporation for National and Community Service, which engage 
millions of citizens each year in service through Senior Corps, 
AmeriCorps, and Learn and Serve America. We are building the capacity of 
organizations and communities to tackle their own problems by investing 
in social innovation and volunteer cultivation. And through United We 
Serve, a national call to service, we are making it easier for women and 
men of all ages to find volunteer opportunities or create their own 
projects where they see a need.
During National Volunteer Week, we celebrate the profound impact of 
volunteers and encourage all Americans to discover their own power to 
make a difference. Every one of us has a role to play in making our 
communities and our country stronger. I encourage all Americans to help 
us renew progress and prosperity and build a brighter future for our 
Nation by visiting www.Serve.gov to find a local project.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10 through April 
16, 2011, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this week by volunteering in service projects across our country 
and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.

Proclamation 8650 of April 8, 2011

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Though our homes and neighborhoods are safer than they have been in 
decades, millions of Americans still become victims of crime each year. 
For many citizens, a sense of security remains painfully elusive, and we 
must continue to fight crime wherever it exists.
During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we renew our commitment to 
assisting those who have been victimized by crime and supporting those 
who help survivors rebuild their lives. Crisis counselors, law 
enforcement professionals, legal advocates, safe haven staff, and other 
service providers help victims meet basic needs and find renewed hope 
for their future.
My Administration remains focused on advancing the progress made in 
preventing crime and enforcing the rights of its survivors. We have 
shined a light on hidden crimes like cyberbullying, online child sexual 
exploitation, and sexual assault on college campuses. Through the 
President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in 
Persons, we are coordinating efforts to address this heinous offense and 
support its victims. The Tribal Law and Order Act I signed into law last 
year gives Native communities new tools to fight crime and greater 
resources to assist American Indian and Alaska Native women who have 
been the victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse.
To avoid the recurrence of another financial crisis, we are also working 
to prevent and prosecute financial crimes. My Administration's Financial 
Fraud Enforcement Task Force helps combat fraud and restore losses 
suffered by individuals affected by predatory lending, mortgage fraud, 
and other deceptive financial practices.
For assistance, resources, or additional information, Americans can 
visit: www.CrimeVictims.gov. As we commemorate National Crime Victims' 
Rights Week, we reaffirm our pledge to join in supporting crime victims 
and creating safer communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10 through April 
16, 2011, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this week by participating in events that raise 
awareness of victims' rights and services and by volunteering to serve 
victims in their time of need.

Proclamation 8651 of April 8, 2011

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout Pan American Day and Pan American Week, we celebrate the 
close partnerships across our hemisphere that advance the ability of our 
citizens to enjoy freedom and reach for their highest aspirations. Every 
day, the future is being forged by the countries and peoples of the 
Americas. The world must now recognize the Americas as a whole as a 
dynamic and growing region, because the Americas are democratic and at 
peace, and we are coming together to address shared challenges. 
Increasingly, our hemisphere is contributing to global prosperity and 
security. The bonds between our people are rooted not only in mutual 
respect and shared interests and responsibilities, but also in common 
values. As the nations of the Americas continue to grow, progress, and 
address the challenges of our day, our friendships will be more 
important than ever to attaining and maintaining security and prosperity 
for all.
This year, the Americas can celebrate milestones that have strengthened 
the ties between our societies. More than 60 years ago, our nations came 
together in an Organization of American States and declared that 
``representative democracy is an indispensable condition for the 
stability, peace, and development of the region.'' A decade ago, we 
reaffirmed this principle, with an Inter-American Democratic Charter 
that stated ``the people of the Americas have a right to democracy and 
their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it.'' This 
year, we also observe the United Nations' and the Organization of 
American States' designation of 2011 as the International Year for 
People of African Descent, an opportunity to recognize the myriad ways 
that men and women of African descent have strengthened our countries 
and enriched our societies.
The Americas demonstrate to countries around the world the strength of 
democracy as a means of supporting people's yearnings for freedom and 
the pursuit of happiness, but we know our work is far from finished. 
Many citizens in our region live in poverty or lack access to jobs and 
economic opportunity, and some suffer injustice and human rights 
violations, including freedom of expression. In Haiti and in other 
places where natural disasters have struck, many lack access to basic 
necessities. As we come together to build our economies, increase 
cooperation on citizen security and trade, and promote democracy, we 
know our friendships, partnerships, and shared principles will help us 
overcome today's challenges and build a safer and more prosperous 
future.
As we celebrate Pan American Day and Pan American Week, let us 
reemphasize the cooperation between all nations of the Americas as a 
vital part

[[Page 34]]

of our interconnected world. Together, we will continue to build on our 
partnerships of equality and shared responsibility and demonstrate that 
change is possible, every nation can be free, and there can be no 
denying the dignity and human rights our countries uphold.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2011, as Pan 
American Day and April 10 through April 16, 2011, as Pan American Week. 
I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the 
United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of

Proclamation 8652 of April 8, 2011

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The men and women of the United States Armed Forces have faced 
innumerable challenges while dedicating their lives to the defense of 
our liberties. Contending with perilous combat zones, deployment 
overseas, and long absences from home, generations of service members 
have answered America's call in its hour of need. On National Former 
Prisoner of War Recognition Day, a grateful Nation acknowledges a debt 
that can never be repaid and honors those who faced the most 
unfathomable of challenges with the utmost bravery and conviction.
We pay solemn tribute to those American sons and daughters who have 
endured unimaginable hardship at the hands of foreign captors. Often 
faced with deplorable physical and mental treatment, the tremendous 
personal sacrifice of these warriors exemplifies the highest of ideals--
honor, duty, and selfless service. We also pay tribute to the families 
and friends of these service members, who embody the same qualities of 
bravery and sacrifice exhibited by their loved ones, and bear a burden 
silently measured in sleepless nights and missed birthdays.
America cherishes those veterans who have returned home after 
imprisonment on foreign soil. We remain dedicated to fulfilling the 
sacred trust to care for all who have borne the battle. This day and 
every day, each of these heroes holds a special place of honor in our 
hearts and the well-earned support of a thankful Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2011, as 
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon all 
Americans

[[Page 35]]

to observe this day of remembrance by honoring our service members, 
veterans, and all American prisoners of war. I also call upon Federal, 
State, and local government officials and organizations to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the

Proclamation 8653 of April 11, 2011

National Equal Pay Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Generations of women have fought for the advancement of their sisters, 
daughters, and themselves in acts of great courage--reaching for and 
winning the right to vote, breaking barriers in America's universities 
and boardrooms, and flooding the modern workforce with skilled talent. 
While our Nation has come far, obstacles continue to exist for working 
women, who still earn less on average than working men. Each year, 
National Equal Pay Day reflects how far into the current year women must 
work to match what men earned in the previous year. On National Equal 
Pay Day, we rededicate ourselves to carrying forward the fight for true 
economic equality for all, regardless of gender.
When the Equal Pay Act was signed into law in 1963, women earned 59 
cents for every dollar earned by men. Though women today are more likely 
than men to attend and graduate from college, women still earn an 
average of only about 77 cents for every dollar a man earns. Even when 
accounting for factors such as experience, education, industry, and 
hours, this wage gap persists. Over the course of her lifetime, this gap 
will cost a woman and her family lost wages, reduced pensions, and 
diminished Social Security benefits. Though we have made great strides, 
wage discrimination is real and women are still more likely to live in 
poverty. These inequities remind us to work even harder to close the 
gaps that still exist.
At a time when families across this country are struggling to make ends 
meet, National Equal Pay Day reminds us that achieving equal pay for 
equal work is not just a women's issue--it is a family issue. In today's 
world, women represent both powerful consumers and vital wage earners. 
Women make up nearly half of the labor force and mothers are the primary 
or co-breadwinners in two-thirds of families. When women are not paid 
fairly, the families that depend on their earnings suffer.
That is why one of my first acts as President was to sign the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, a law that empowers women who have been 
discriminated against in their salaries to have their day in court to 
make it right. I established the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task 
Force to identify persistent challenges to equal pay enforcement and 
ensure equal pay laws are vigorously enforced throughout our country. My 
Administration also published

[[Page 36]]

Women in America: Indicators of Social and Economic Well-Being, the 
first comprehensive Federal report on the status of American women in 
almost 50 years, which documents that although women have higher 
graduation rates than men at all academic levels, the wage gap still 
persists. We are pursuing these efforts because of the simple fact that 
when women are paid fairly, our whole Nation will benefit.
Achieving equal pay for women is vital to strengthening the future 
prosperity of our country. For the sake of our daughters and 
granddaughters, we must renew our commitment to eliminating the barriers 
women face in the workforce and give both women and men the opportunity 
to reach greater heights.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 12, 2011, as 
National Equal Pay Day. I call upon all Americans to recognize the full 
value of women's skills and their significant contributions to the labor 
force, acknowledge the injustice of wage discrimination, and join 
efforts to achieve equal pay.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8654 of April 12, 2011

Civil War Sesquicentennial

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On April 12, 1861, artillery guns boomed across Charleston Harbor in an 
attack on Fort Sumter. These were the first shots of a civil war that 
would stretch across 4 years of tremendous sacrifice, with over 3 
million Americans serving in battles whose names reach across our 
history. The meaning of freedom and the very soul of our Nation were 
contested in the hills of Gettysburg and the roads of Antietam, the 
fields of Manassas and the woods of the Wilderness. When the terrible 
and costly struggle was over, a new meaning was conferred on our 
country's name--the United States of America. We might be tested, but 
whatever our fate might be, it would be as one Nation.
The Civil War was a conflict characterized by legendary acts of bravery 
in the face of unprecedented carnage. Those who lived in these times--
from the resolute African American soldier volunteering his life for the 
liberation of his fellow man to the determined President secure in the 
rightness of his cause--brought a new birth of freedom to a country 
still mending its divisions.
On this milestone in American history, we remember the great cost of the 
unity and liberty we now enjoy, causes for which so many have laid down 
their lives. Though America would struggle to extend equal rights to all 
our

[[Page 37]]

citizens and carry out the letter of our laws after the war, the 
sacrifices of soldiers, sailors, Marines, abolitionists, and countless 
other Americans would bring a renewed significance to the liberties 
established by our Founders. When the guns fell silent and the fate of 
our Nation was secured, blue and gray would unite under one flag and the 
institution of slavery would be forever abolished from our land.
As a result of the sacrifice of millions, we would extend the promise 
and freedom enshrined in our Constitution to all Americans. Through the 
13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, we would prohibit slavery and 
indentured servitude, establish equal protection under the law, and 
extend the right to vote to former slaves. We would reach for a more 
perfect Union together as Americans, bound by the collective threads of 
history and our common hopes for the future.
We are the United States of America--we have been tested, we have 
repaired our Union, and we have emerged stronger. As we respond to the 
critical challenges of our time, let us do so as adherents to the 
enduring values of our founding and stakeholders in the promise of a 
shared tomorrow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 12, 2011, as the 
first day of the Civil War Sesquicentennial. I call upon all Americans 
to observe this Sesquicentennial with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
and activities that honor the legacy of freedom and unity that the Civil 
War bestowed upon our Nation.

The future of our Nation depends on our ability to instill in future 
generations the values that will help them write the next proud chapter 
of the American story--a dedication to knowledge and a sense of 
compassion for their fellow citizens. As we celebrate Education and 
Sharing Day, U.S.A., we recommit to preparing our sons and daughters to 
thrive with principle and purpose in the 21st century.
Over the next decade, nearly half of all new jobs will require advanced 
training or a college degree. Ensuring our children meet this standard 
will take the collective commitment of parents, teachers, and 
communities coming together to instill a love of learning in our young 
people. By doing so, we can unlock every child's potential and give them 
the chance to fulfill

[[Page 38]]

their dreams, while laying the foundation for our country's continued 
prosperity.
Education alone, however, cannot fully prepare our children to stand at 
the helm of our Nation. In an increasingly interconnected world, America 
remains a beacon of hope for many across the globe because of our open 
hearts during times of extraordinary challenge and our dedication to our 
common humanity. We must nurture these traits in our children to ensure 
America continues to be a symbol of promise to the world.
On Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., we celebrate the example set by 
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who dedicated 
his life to improving education and fostering goodwill for all people. 
His legacy continues to inspire individuals to carry forward his effort 
to build a brighter future. Each year, Education and Sharing Day, 
U.S.A., reminds us of our obligation to create opportunities for a 
better tomorrow--life lessons we pass on to all our children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 15, 2011, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8656 of April 15, 2011

National Park Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, America's national parks--from the smallest historic sites to 
the largest natural spaces--contribute to our Nation's collective health 
and spirit. These places preserve our unique history and iconic symbols. 
They protect ecosystems and serve as reservoirs of biodiversity. They 
are sources of natural sounds, clean water, and fresh air. Our parks 
provide accessible, safe, and affordable places to appreciate the bounty 
of our land. They offer opportunities for wholesome outdoor recreation, 
which can improve the health and vitality of all Americans.
In no place is America's natural and historic legacy more evident than 
our extraordinary collection of 394 national parks. ``Healthy Parks, 
Healthy People,'' the focus for this year's National Park Week, 
highlights the role of public lands--whether an iconic national park or 
a local green space--in connecting human and environmental well-being. 
To encourage citizens to spend time in national parks, all entrance fees 
will be waived during National Park Week. All Americans can visit 
www.NPS.gov to find nearby parks where history can be discovered and 
nature explored.

[[Page 39]]

America is fortunate to have a long history of conservation pioneers, 
like President Theodore Roosevelt, who understood the value of 
protecting our most precious landscapes. My Administration is building 
on this legacy with the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, designed to 
create a 21st-century conservation ethic and reconnect Americans with 
our natural, cultural, and historic heritage. We are working to ensure 
more American children have access to safe and clean parks and open 
spaces close to their homes. We will better support the farmers, 
ranchers, and private landowners that help protect rural landscapes and 
we will manage our public lands and waters with a renewed commitment to 
sound stewardship and resilience. As part of this responsibility, 
Federal agencies are also partnering with the First Lady's ``Let's 
Move!'' initiative on ``Let's Move Outside!,'' a program that connects 
young people and their families to the outdoors to encourage healthy 
recreation.
The National Park Service, with 84 million acres of land and 17,000 
miles of trails, works with environmental groups, scientists, business 
innovators, and health-care providers to promote physical activity in 
parks. Every Federal dollar invested in our national parks generates 
benefits for State and local economies. Beyond park boundaries, the 
National Park Service's Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance 
Program works with communities to create and enhance local parks, 
revitalize rivers, preserve valuable open spaces, and develop trail and 
greenway networks that provide close-to-home outdoor opportunities for 
everyone--from children to seniors--to get outside, get healthy, and 
have fun.
During National Park Week, we reaffirm our need to maintain connections 
to the natural world. Whether on the open range or in the heart of a 
bustling city, each of us can work to conserve our lands and reinforce 
the importance of setting aside beautiful places for inspiration, 
relaxation, and recreation for all people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 16 through April 
24, 2011, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to visit 
their national parks and be reminded of these unique blessings we share 
as a Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8657 of April 22, 2011

Earth Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For over 40 years, our Nation has come together on Earth Day to 
appreciate and raise awareness about our environment, natural heritage, 
and the resources upon which generations of Americans have depended. 
Healthy land and clean water and air are essential to the health of our 
communities and wildlife. Earth Day is an opportunity to renew America's 
commitment to preserving and protecting the state of our environment 
through community service and responsible stewardship.
From the purity of the air we breathe and the water we drink to the 
condition of the land where we live, work, and play, the vitality of our 
natural resources has a profound influence on the well-being of our 
families and the strength of our economy. Our Nation has a proud 
conservation tradition, which includes countless individuals who have 
worked to safeguard our natural legacy and ensure our children can 
benefit from these resources. Looking to the future of our planet, 
American leadership will continue to be pivotal as we confront the 
environmental challenges that threaten the health of both our country 
and the globe.
Today, our world faces the major global environmental challenge of a 
changing climate. Our entire planet must address this problem because no 
nation, however large or small, wealthy or poor, can escape the impact 
of climate change. The United States can be a leader in reducing the 
dangerous pollution that causes global warming and can propel these 
advances by investing in the clean energy technologies, markets, and 
practices that will empower us to win the future.
While our changing climate requires international leadership, global 
action on clean energy and climate change must be joined with local 
action. Every American deserves the cleanest air, the safest water, and 
unpolluted land, and each person can take steps to protect those 
precious resources. When we reduce environmental hazards, especially in 
our most overburdened and polluted cities and neighborhoods, we 
prioritize the health of our families, and move towards building the 
clean energy economy of the 21st century.
To meet this responsibility, Federal and local programs will continue to 
ensure our Nation's clean air and water laws are effective, that our 
communities are protected from contaminated sites and other pollution, 
and that our children are safe from chemicals, toxins, and other 
environmental threats. Partnerships and community-driven strategies, 
like those highlighted by the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, are 
vital to building a future where children have access to outdoor places 
close to their homes; where our rural working lands and waters are 
conserved and restored; and our parks, forests, waters, and other 
natural areas are protected for future generations.
On Earth Day, we recognize the role that each of us can play in 
preserving our natural heritage. To protect our environment, keep our 
communities

[[Page 41]]

healthy, and help develop the economy of the future, I encourage all 
Americans to visit www.WhiteHouse.Gov/EarthDay to learn ways to protect 
and preserve our environment for centuries to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2011, as 
Earth Day. I encourage all Americans to participate in service programs 
and activities that will protect our environment and contribute to a 
prosperous, healthy, and sustainable future.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8658 of April 27, 2011

Workers Memorial Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every year in America, nearly four million workers suffer an 
occupational injury or illness, and thousands die from work-related 
injuries. These preventable tragedies disable workers, devastate 
families, and erode our economy. On Workers Memorial Day, we celebrate 
the improvements in American workplaces and remember those who have been 
injured, sickened, or killed on the job. This year, we also recognize 
the 40th anniversary of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, and we pay tribute to all those who have dedicated their 
lives to ensuring safety in the workplace.
The protections working Americans enjoy today were not easily gained. 
They had to be won by generations of courageous men and women, fighting 
to secure decent working conditions, standing up for those most 
vulnerable, and sometimes risking their own economic security and lives. 
One century ago in New York City, nearly 150 young garment workers 
either burned or jumped to their deaths when a fire ignited in the 
Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. This senseless tragedy inspired a movement, 
calling Americans to pay attention to workplace conditions and bestowing 
a new relevance on the importance of unions. Organized labor has 
continued to give voice to millions of working men and women by 
representing their views and fighting for good working conditions and 
fair wages.
Until 1970, many Americans still did not have the legal right to a safe 
workplace, and many employers were not legally obligated to control 
hazards. The Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 fundamentally changed 
American workplaces. These laws provided workers the right to safe and 
healthy workplaces, ensured workers were protected from dangerous 
conditions, and provided protections to employees who reported safety 
and health hazards.

[[Page 42]]

In the four decades since those landmark laws were enacted, we have seen 
great progress in conditions for working Americans. Federal agencies are 
helping reduce workplace injury rates and control exposure to deadly 
hazards by using research on injury and illness causation, implementing 
common sense standards, and promoting cooperative programs. The 
Department of Labor is continuing to enforce and improve our workplace 
safety regulations and is partnering with the Department of Justice to 
make sure the full force of the law is brought to bear in cases where 
workers are put in harm's way. Many of our Nation's employers have 
embraced exemplary worker injury and illness prevention programs--
efforts that exceed Federal safety and health standards. Together, these 
improvements have fostered innovation, increased productivity, and 
bolstered competitiveness while saving countless lives in the process.
On Workers Memorial Day, we reflect on the vital achievements of the 
past and recommit to keeping all workers safe and healthy in the future. 
We owe nothing less to the countless working Americans who have built 
and shaped our Nation, and to those who have lost their lives or been 
injured on the job.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2011, as 
Workers Memorial Day. I call upon all Americans to participate in 
ceremonies and activities in memory of those killed or injured due to 
unsafe working conditions.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8659 of April 29, 2011

Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This month, our Nation celebrates the contributions and accomplishments 
of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). Our AAPI communities 
have roots that span the globe, but their stories of striving and 
success are uniquely American. As we celebrate Asian American and 
Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we recognize the entrepreneurship and 
fortitude of individuals who have helped build our country and shape the 
American dream for centuries.
Generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have helped develop 
and defend the United States, often in the face of tremendous racial and 
cultural prejudice. Despite these difficulties, AAPI men and women 
struggled, sacrificed, and persevered to build a better life for their 
children and all Americans.

[[Page 43]]

Today, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have a profound impact on 
our society as leaders in all facets of American life, thriving as 
athletes and public servants, entrepreneurs and artists. Whether as 
small business owners or as proud members of the United States Armed 
Forces, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are helping to write the 
next chapter of the American story.
Although many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have achieved 
success, far too many still struggle to overcome obstacles of 
unemployment, poverty, and language barriers or face significant 
education, economic, and health disparities. To help address the diverse 
challenges affecting our AAPI communities, I reestablished the White 
House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The 
Initiative coordinates the efforts of agencies throughout the Federal 
Government to promote increased access to and participation in Federal 
programs for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who remain 
underserved, so we can continue to be a Nation where all things are 
possible for all people. All Americans can visit www.AAPI.gov to learn 
more about the important work of this Initiative.
From our earliest days, intrepid men and women from the Asia-Pacific 
region have forged enduring links between America and other nations as 
they moved across the Pacific. In today's globalized world, these bonds 
remain critical, reminding the United States of our rich shared history 
and integrated future with the dynamic Asia-Pacific region. During Asian 
American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, let us celebrate the 
millions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders whose talents and 
contributions strengthen our economy, protect our security, and enliven 
our country every day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2011 as Asian 
American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans 
to visit www.AsianPacificHeritage.gov to learn more about the history of 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8660 of April 29, 2011

Jewish American Heritage Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since before our Nation's founding, America's shores have been a safe 
harbor for people seeking shelter, hope, and new lives free from 
persecution. Here, people of all faiths have broken bread, come 
together, and built a better future for their families. The Jewish story 
is intertwined with the American story--one of overcoming great 
hardship, and one of commitment to

[[Page 44]]

building a more just world. This month, we embrace and celebrate the 
vast contributions Jewish Americans have made to our country.
Seeking a brighter future, a small band of Jewish refugees came to this 
land more than three centuries ago, to a place called New Amsterdam. 
Hundreds of years later, as Holocaust survivors and families caught 
behind the Iron Curtain made their way to America, their perseverance in 
the face of unimaginable tragedy inspired the world and proved that the 
Jewish people will not be defeated. Many endured bigotry even here, 
reminding us that we must continue to fight prejudice and violence at 
home and around the globe. In this spirit, President Truman recognized 
the small, fledgling nation of Israel within minutes of its creation. To 
this day, we continue to foster an unbreakable partnership with Israel, 
and we remain committed to pursuing peace in the region and ensuring 
Israel's security.
From those first days in New Amsterdam, Jewish Americans have dedicated 
their innovation, creativity, and hearts to the greater good--
contributing scientific accomplishments, pioneering works of literature 
and musical genius, and performing distinguished service in our Nation's 
military. Jewish Americans have defended our country since the days of 
the American Revolution as devoted service members and chaplains, and 
they continue to serve with distinction in our Armed Forces.
Nearly 70 years ago, during World War II, the U.S.A.T. Dorchester 
suffered an explosion at sea while carrying almost a thousand soldiers 
and civilian workers. On board were four Army chaplains--two Protestant, 
one Catholic, and one Jewish. While the ship sank, the four chaplains 
gave their own life jackets to four men without any, calmed the wounded, 
and preached strength to the survivors, linking arms and praying 
together as the ship submerged. In a time of great need, these chaplains 
showed that their shared commitment to the lives of others was stronger 
than any division of faith or background.
This same spirit is found in the countless Jewish Americans who, through 
their every day actions, work to provide a better life for future 
generations by joining hands with all who seek equality and progress. 
This month, we remember that the history and unique identity of Jewish 
Americans is part of the grand narrative of our country, forged in the 
friendships and shared wisdom between people of different faiths.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2011 as Jewish 
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to visit 
www.JewishHeritageMonth.gov to learn more about the heritage and 
contributions of Jewish Americans and to observe this month with 
appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8661 of April 29, 2011

National Foster Care Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Progress in America can be measured by the opportunities we pass on to 
our children. For nearly half a million youth in foster care across our 
country, the best path to success we can give them is the chance to 
experience a loving home where they can feel secure and thrive. During 
National Foster Care Month, we renew our commitment to ensuring a 
brighter future for foster youth, and we celebrate the selfless 
individuals who make a meaningful difference in their lives.
Young people in foster care are in the system through no fault of their 
own, and each of our Nation's children deserves a stable home and a 
devoted family. Strong support structures provide children with the 
environment needed to learn, grow, and reach their greatest potential. 
Permanence is critical to the future success of foster youth and must be 
a key component of foster care initiatives.
My Administration is committed to achieving security for every child and 
supporting adolescents in foster care as they transition to adulthood. 
The Permanency Innovations Initiative, spearheaded by the Department of 
Health and Human Services, is providing support to public-private 
partnerships focused on decreasing the number of children in long-term 
foster care. Over the next 5 years, this program will invest $100 
million in new intervention strategies to help foster youth move into 
permanent homes, test new approaches to reducing time spent in foster 
care placements, and remove the most serious barriers to finding 
lasting, loving environments. Over 110,000 children in foster care today 
are waiting to be adopted. Across America, there are families who need 
these children as much as these children need families. I encourage 
those interested in adopting a child in need of a home to explore the 
life-changing resources available at www.AdoptUSKids.org.
We are also investing in the health and well-being of our young people 
in foster care. Through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we 
have significantly increased funding for the Title IV-E adoption and 
foster care assistance program to provide safe and stable out-of-home 
care for children. As a result of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act I 
signed into law last year, all children enrolled in foster care 
automatically qualify for free meals in all Department of Agriculture 
child nutrition programs. Additionally, beginning in 2014, the 
Affordable Care Act will require States to extend Medicaid coverage up 
to age 26 for all youth who have aged out of the foster care system.
As a Nation, we all have a responsibility to remain persistent in the 
charge to provide the best care possible for children when they cannot 
remain in their own homes. During National Foster Care Month, we 
recognize the efforts of foster families, social workers, faith-based 
and community organizations, and others that are improving the lives of 
young people in foster care across our country, and I encourage all 
Americans to partake in efforts to serve these children in the year 
ahead.

[[Page 46]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2011 as National 
Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by 
taking an active role in activities across our country that recognize 
not only these cherished children and youth, but also the commitment of 
so many that touch their lives at a most challenging time.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8662 of April 29, 2011

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month shines a spotlight on the 
important role physical activity plays in our Nation's health and 
wellness. Participation in sports can strengthen both body and mind, and 
all kinds of active pastimes can help improve physical and mental well-
being. During this month, we rededicate ourselves to educating, 
engaging, and empowering Americans of all backgrounds and abilities to 
live a healthy lifestyle.
Through the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, my 
Administration is encouraging Americans to make physical fitness and 
nutritious eating part of their daily lives. Regular physical activity 
and good nutrition are essential to staying healthy. A balanced diet and 
exercise can help reduce the risk of developing chronic and costly 
diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. For more information 
on the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, and for 
tips on exercise and nutrition, visit: www.Fitness.gov.
The health of our sons and daughters is key to our Nation's future. 
Unfortunately, childhood obesity rates in America have tripled over the 
past three decades, and nearly one in three children in our country is 
either overweight or obese. With the help of adults serving as role 
models and encouraging positive behaviors, we can give our children the 
healthy future they deserve and turn around these troubling statistics. 
Playing a game of basketball or taking a walk through a park with a 
child may seem like small steps, but they can have an immeasurable 
impact on the conduct and health of a young person. When children see 
people in their lives making healthful decisions and encouraging them to 
do the same, they are more likely to emulate those actions.
The First Lady's ``Let's Move!'' initiative is focused on solving the 
epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation by inspiring children 
to be physically active and empowering parents and caregivers to make 
healthy choices for their families. In its first year, ``Let's Move!'' 
made great strides

[[Page 47]]

in building awareness around the issue of childhood obesity, mobilizing 
support, garnering commitments across the country, and encouraging 
Americans from every sector of our society to get involved. This 
progress reminds us of what is possible when we work together as a 
Nation to promote healthy habits.
During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, let us reaffirm our 
commitment to leading active lives and fostering healthy homes and 
communities for the next generation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2011 as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to make daily physical activity, sports participation, and good 
nutrition a priority in their lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of

Proclamation 8663 of April 29, 2011

Older Americans Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Older Americans are now living longer, healthier, and richer lives than 
ever before. As the eldest of the baby boomers turn 65, our Nation can 
look forward to the contributions of a new generation of American 
seniors. Each year, we set aside the month of May to honor older 
Americans, celebrate their role in steering the course of our history, 
and recognize their valuable insights and wisdom.
The theme for this year's Older Americans Month, ``Older Americans: 
Connecting the Community,'' reminds us that seniors are continually 
enriching lives and contributing to our country. This theme also 
highlights how technology, including social media and assistive devices, 
can help adults remain engaged in their communities and connected to 
friends and family who may live far away.
My Administration is committed to meeting the needs and aspirations of 
American seniors, both now and in the future. We are working to improve 
the health and well-being of older men and women with a focus on 
preventive care and community living. The historic Affordable Care Act 
gives America's seniors greater freedom and control over their health 
care. In addition to benefitting from more comprehensive prescription 
drug coverage, most people with Medicare will now be able to receive an 
annual wellness visit and many critical preventive services for free, 
including certain cancer screenings such as mammograms and 
colonoscopies.

[[Page 48]]

Today, millions of our Nation's seniors are making a significant 
difference in society, strengthening our communities through their 
service. Older Americans support the arts and serve meals at soup 
kitchens. They mentor our children and stock the shelves at food 
pantries and libraries. Programs supported by the Corporation for 
National and Community Service and the Administration on Aging are 
working to connect men and women to community service, benefiting 
Americans of all ages. Interested individuals can visit 
www.SeniorCorps.gov for more information and local volunteer 
opportunities.
Having lived through many of our Nation's most challenging times, older 
Americans have shaped the story of America and secured the promise of 
our future. We are privileged to recognize these treasured citizens 
during Older Americans Month, and honor both the impact they have made 
and their accomplishments yet to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2011 as Older 
Americans Month. I invite Americans of all ages to acknowledge the 
contributions of older Americans during this month and throughout the 
year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the

National Charter Schools Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In communities across our country, successful public charter schools 
help put children on the path to academic excellence by harnessing the 
power of new ideas, ground-breaking strategies, and the collective 
involvement of students, parents, teachers, and administrators. During 
National Charter Schools Week, we recognize these institutions of 
learning and renew our commitment to preparing our children with the 
knowledge and skills they will need to compete in the 21st century.
The unique flexibility afforded to charter schools places them at the 
forefront of innovation and in a unique position to spark a dialogue 
with other public schools on how to organize teaching and learning and 
enhance curricula. As part of our strategy for strengthening public 
education, my Administration has supported charter schools and rewarded 
successful innovation, encouraging States to improve their laws and 
policies so students can thrive.
Equally important to a world-class education system are actions taken by 
charter school authorizers and the charter community itself to 
strengthen effectiveness and deliver results that improve educational 
outcomes. My

[[Page 49]]

Administration will continue to encourage meaningful accountability, 
including closure of low-performing charter schools and replication of 
advances and reforms made at high-performing charter schools.
In order to win the global competition for new jobs and industries, we 
must win the global competition to educate our children. At their best, 
charter schools provide us with an opportunity to meet this challenge 
and produce the next generation of great American leaders.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1 through May 7, 
2011, as National Charter School Week. I commend our Nation's charter 
schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and 
communities to support charter schools and the students they serve.

Law Day, U.S.A., 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

At the core of our Nation's values is our faith in the ideals of 
equality and justice under law. It is a belief embedded in our most 
cherished documents, and honored by President Eisenhower when he 
established Law Day in 1958 as ``a day of national dedication to the 
principles of government under law.'' Each Law Day, we uphold our 
commitment to the rule of law and celebrate its protection of the 
freedoms we enjoy.
This year, we pay tribute to one of America's Founders and our second 
President, John Adams. As a young attorney in colonial Massachusetts, 
John Adams was asked to represent a British officer and eight British 
soldiers charged with firing into a crowd and killing five men in the 
Boston Massacre. In the face of mass public outcry and at great personal 
risk, he accepted the case and showed the world that America is a nation 
of laws and that a fair trial is the right of all people.
President Adams' legacy of dedication to fairness and the rights of the 
accused has been carried forward by members of the legal profession for 
more than two centuries. It is championed by those who represent the 
accused and exemplified by women and men who are devoted to securing 
equal rights for all, both in America and around the world.
On this Law Day, I encourage all Americans to celebrate and reflect upon 
the example left to us by President John Adams and our centuries of 
adherence to the rule of law. In so doing, we help ensure future 
generations will inherit and promote the ideals that help move our 
Nation forward.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2011, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to 
acknowledge the importance of our Nation's legal and judicial systems 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to display the flag of 
the United States in support of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8666 of April 29, 2011

Loyalty Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When our Nation's Founders adopted the Declaration of Independence, they 
pledged to build a government that represented America's highest ideals, 
a Union that secured its people's sacred rights by ``deriving [its] just 
powers from the consent of the governed.'' From the Revolutionary War to 
the formation of our young country, our Founders' commitment to this 
principle never wavered. In the fall of 1787, America launched its 
improbable experiment in democracy, embedding in our Constitution the 
core values of liberty, equality, and justice for all.
Throughout our proud history, Americans motivated by loyalty and 
fidelity to these principles have worked to perfect our Union. Our 
Constitution grants Americans unprecedented freedoms and opportunities. 
We are free to speak our minds, worship as we please, choose our 
leaders, and criticize them when we disagree. The liberties enshrined in 
our founding documents define us as a people and a Nation, ensuring that 
every American with the drive to work hard and play by the rules has the 
chance to build a better life for their children and grandchildren.
For over two centuries, Americans have looked with pride and devotion on 
a Nation that reflects its people's highest moral aspirations. On this 
day, we celebrate our brave men and women in uniform and honor those who 
gave their lives to keep our country safe and free. We also reflect on 
the contributions of patriotic civilians united by an understanding that 
citizenship is not just a collection of rights, but also a set of 
responsibilities.
The ideals upheld by our forebears have stirred the resolute devotion of 
the American people and inspired hope in the hearts of people from 
across the globe. With trust in a future that keeps faith with our 
history, we remain true to the promise of America and the spirit that 
unites us all.
In order to recognize the American spirit of loyalty and the sacrifices 
that so many have made for our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 85-
529 as amended, has designated May 1 of each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' On 
this day, let us reaffirm our allegiance to the United States of 
America, our Constitution, and our founding values.

[[Page 51]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2011, as Loyalty Day. This Loyalty 
Day, I call upon all the people of the United States to join in support 
of this national observance, whether by displaying the flag of the 
United States or pledging allegiance to the Republic for which it 
stands.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8667 of April 29, 2011

National Day of Prayer, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, Americans have turned to prayer for strength, 
inspiration, and solidarity.
Prayer has played an important role in the American story and in shaping 
our Nation's leaders. President Abraham Lincoln once said, ``I have been 
driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I 
had nowhere else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed 
insufficient for the day.'' The late Coretta Scott King recounted a 
particularly difficult night, during the Montgomery bus boycott, when 
her husband, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., received a 
threatening phone call and prayed at the kitchen table, saying, ``Lord, 
I have nothing left. I have nothing left. I have come to the point where 
I can't face it alone.'' Dr. King said, in that moment of prayer, he was 
filled with a sense of comfort and resolve, which his wife credited as a 
turning point in the civil rights movement.
It is thus fitting that, from the earliest years of our country's 
history, Congress and Presidents have set aside days to recognize the 
role prayer has played in so many definitive moments in our history. On 
this National Day of Prayer, let us follow the example of President 
Lincoln and Dr. King. Let us be thankful for the liberty that allows 
people of all faiths to worship or not worship according to the dictates 
of their conscience, and let us be thankful for the many other freedoms 
and blessings that we often take for granted.
Let us pray for the men and women of our Armed Forces and the many 
selfless sacrifices they and their families make on behalf of our 
Nation. Let us pray for the police officers, firefighters, and other 
first responders who put themselves in harm's way every day to protect 
their fellow citizens. And let us ask God for the sustenance and 
guidance for all of us to meet the great challenges we face as a Nation.
Let us remember in our thoughts and prayers those who have been affected 
by natural disasters at home and abroad in recent months, as well as 
those working tirelessly to render assistance. And, at a time when many 
around the world face uncertainty and unrest, but also hold resurgent 
hope for

[[Page 52]]

freedom and justice, let our prayers be with men and women everywhere 
who seek peace, human dignity, and the same rights we treasure here in 
America.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the 
President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first 
Thursday in May as a ``National Day of Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 5, 2011, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
invite all citizens of our Nation, as their own faith or conscience 
directs them, to join me in giving thanks for the many blessings we 
enjoy, and I ask all people of faith to join me in asking God for 
guidance, mercy, and protection for our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8668 of May 3, 2011

50th Anniversary of the Freedom Rides

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Fifty years ago, America was struggling to implement the ideals of 
justice and equality set forth in our founding. The Freedom Rides, 
organized in the spring of 1961, were an interracial, nonviolent effort 
to protest the practice of segregation. Setting out from Washington, 
D.C., on May 4, 1961, the Freedom Riders sought to actualize the 
decision in Boynton v. Virginia, which held that interstate passengers 
had a right to be served without discrimination, and to challenge the 
enforcement of local segregation laws and practices.
The Freedom Rides, organized by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), 
the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and other devoted 
advocates, built upon the boycotts and sit-ins that were defying Jim 
Crow segregation across the South. The Freedom Riders themselves were 
black and white, often students and young people, and committed to the 
cause of nonviolent resistance. Along the way, buses were attacked and 
men and women were intimidated, arrested, and brutally beaten. The 
publicity generated by the courageous Freedom Riders as they faced 
continued violence and complicit local police drew the attention of the 
Kennedy Administration and Americans across our country.
Through their defiant journeys, the Freedom Riders sent a resounding 
message to the rest of our Nation that desegregation was a moral 
imperative. The Freedom Riders also motivated and mobilized the next 
generation of civil rights leaders. The unflinching bravery and 
unyielding commitment of the Freedom Riders inspired many of those 
involved to become lifelong activists, organizers, and leaders in the 
civil rights movement.

[[Page 53]]

Today, we remember the Freedom Riders for the sacrifices they made in 
pursuit of the rights we now enjoy. They showed that people working 
together across backgrounds and boundaries could hold America 
accountable to our highest ideals and bend the arc of history towards 
justice. They showed that young people have the power to generate a 
movement for equality and steer the course of our Nation. Because of 
their efforts, and the work of those who marched and stood against 
injustice, we live in a country where all Americans have the right to 
dream and choose their own destiny.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2011 as the 50th 
Anniversary of the Freedom Rides. I call upon all Americans to 
participate in ceremonies and activities that honor the Freedom Riders 
and all those who struggled for equal rights during the civil rights 
movement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8669 of May 5, 2011

Military Spouse Appreciation Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Military spouses serve as steady and supportive partners to the heroes 
in uniform who protect and defend our great Nation every day. Across 
America and around the world, military spouses serve our country in 
their own special way, helping families and friends through the stress 
of a deployment, caring for our wounded warriors, and supporting each 
other when a loved one has made the ultimate sacrifice.
Our service members and their families seldom ask for support or 
recognition. They carry out their duties to family and country with the 
quiet courage and strength that has always exemplified the American 
spirit. On Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we have an opportunity to 
not only honor the husbands and wives of our service members, but also 
thank them by actively expressing our gratitude in both word and deed.
When a member of our Armed Forces is deployed, an entire family is 
called to serve. The readiness of our troops depends on the readiness of 
our military families, as millions of parents, children, and loved ones 
sacrifice as well. This means supporting our military spouses is also a 
national security imperative. Earlier this year, my Administration 
released the report on military families, Strengthening our Military 
Families: Meeting America's Commitment, which marshaled resources from 
across our Government to identify new opportunities to support these 
patriots.
First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden are working tirelessly to 
enlist all sectors of American life to address the unique challenges of 
military

[[Page 54]]

families. Their national initiative, ``Joining Forces,'' mobilizes 
Americans to give our service members and their families the 
opportunities and support they have earned. Americans can find service 
projects, send messages of thanks to military families, and learn more 
about this initiative by visiting: www.JoiningForces.gov.
On Military Spouse Appreciation Day, let us join together to show our 
service members we are taking care of their families back home as they 
serve our Nation across the globe. As neighbors, teachers, parents, and 
fellow citizens, we can reach out to military husbands and wives in our 
communities. We can show our appreciation in countless ways, from 
offering to help with household maintenance and childcare to encouraging 
the community involvement and career development of military spouses.
It is through our actions that we show our commitment to our service 
members and their spouses. By embracing military families, we 
demonstrate our partnership in the defense of our freedom and the 
security of the United States.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6, 2011, as 
Military Spouse Appreciation Day. I call upon the people of the United 
States to honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8670 of May 6, 2011

National Women's Health Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Women are a foundation of our families, and their health affects the 
well-being of our communities and our country. They often make health 
care decisions for their families as well as themselves. However, 
American women have not always had access to the health care they need, 
or the freedom to make the best health choices for their loved ones. As 
a Nation, we must ensure our mothers, daughters, friends, and colleagues 
receive fair treatment and access to resources they need to live 
healthy, happy lives. During National Women's Health Week, we reaffirm 
our commitment to making women's health a priority.
In the past, insurance companies have effectively considered being a 
woman a ``pre-existing condition,'' and the specific medical needs of 
women meant higher fees and less coverage. Before the Affordable Care 
Act became law last year, insurance companies could deny coverage to 
women due to previous events such as having had cancer or having been 
pregnant. In 2014, it will be illegal for insurance companies to 
discriminate against

[[Page 55]]

anyone with a pre-existing condition, or charge women higher premiums 
than they charge men.
The Affordable Care Act gives women greater freedom and control over 
their health care. Thanks to this landmark legislation, women joining 
new health plans have the ability to choose their own doctor from any 
primary care provider, OB-GYN, or pediatrician in their health plan's 
network without a referral. The new insurance exchanges created by this 
law ensure coverage of preventive care and basic health services, 
including maternity care, which is often not provided in health plans in 
the individual insurance market.
National Women's Health Week is also an opportunity for women of all 
ages, ethnicities, and economic circumstances to take simple, everyday 
steps to embrace healthier lifestyles. This week, we encourage women to 
schedule their annual checkups and talk to their health care provider 
about important health screenings, many of which will be free of charge 
because of the Affordable Care Act. All American women and their loved 
ones can visit www.WomensHealth.gov and www.GirlsHealth.gov for more 
information and resources on living longer and healthier lives. During 
National Women's Health Week, I encourage women, and all Americans, to 
make their own health a priority and support each other in these 
efforts.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 8 through May 14, 
2011, as National Women's Health Week. I encourage all Americans to 
celebrate the progress we have made in protecting women's health and to 
promote awareness, prevention, and educational activities that improve 
the health of all women.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8671 of May 6, 2011

Mother's Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As our society has changed, so have the challenges facing women raising 
families. Many American women are raising children at home while caring 
for an elderly parent, holding down two jobs, serving as the sole parent 
in a family, or defending our country overseas as a service member. Our 
Nation's mothers not only look after our needs and teach us to be 
compassionate and responsible, but also manage households, build 
careers, and improve our neighborhoods and communities. While the roles 
and responsibilities of mothers have evolved, their guidance and care 
remains as strong and constant as ever.

[[Page 56]]

On Mother's Day, we celebrate the extraordinary importance of mothers in 
our lives. The bond of love and dedication a mother shares with her 
children and family is without bounds or conditions. Whether an adoptive 
mom or grandmother, mother or partner, the women who raise us show us 
that no hurdle is too high, and no dream is beyond our reach. As sons 
and daughters, we show our gratitude for the women in our lives who care 
for us, shape our values, and set us on the path to a limitless future.
Throughout our history, mothers have made remarkable sacrifices for the 
well-being of their loved ones. Nearly a century ago, Anna Jarvis, who 
had suffered the loss of her beloved mother, campaigned with many other 
Americans to make Mother's Day a recognized holiday and pay respect to 
all women raising children. Today, we continue to celebrate the 
influence, love, and nurturing our mothers provide in our lives and in 
our national life.
To support the parents who are raising tomorrow's leaders, my 
Administration is committed to doing all we can to create jobs and 
economic opportunities for families across America. We are striving to 
help mothers in the workplace by enforcing equal pay laws and addressing 
workplace flexibility as families balance the demands of work, child and 
elder care, and education. My budget strengthens the Child and Dependent 
Care Tax Credit to help families afford the cost of quality childcare. 
The tax-cut package we passed last December extended expansions of the 
Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, providing a tax cut for 
15.7 million families with about 29.1 million children. The Affordable 
Care Act gives women more access to health care and better resources to 
protect the health of their families by requiring new insurance plans to 
cover wellness benefits for children, ending the exclusion of pre-
existing conditions by insurance companies, and extending parents' 
health coverage for young adults up to age 26. First Lady Michelle 
Obama's ``Let's Move!'' initiative is also providing mothers with 
helpful tools to support their children's healthy growth.
Mothers are the rocks of our families and a foundation in our 
communities. In gratitude for their generous love, patient counsel, and 
lifelong support, let us pay respect to the women who carry out the hard 
work of motherhood with skill and grace, and let us remember those 
mothers who, though no longer with us, inspire us still.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914, (38 Stat. 
770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as ``Mother's 
Day'' and requested the President to call for its appropriate 
observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 8, 2011, as Mother's Day. I urge all 
Americans to express their love, respect, and gratitude to mothers 
everywhere, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8672 of May 9, 2011

National Building Safety Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Building safety is a critical component of our homeland security, our 
personal and public safety, the protection of property, and our economic 
well-being. While disasters have had devastating and heartbreaking 
effects in our country and around the world, modern building safety 
standards and fire prevention codes help us withstand, mitigate, and 
rapidly recover from hurricanes, winter storms, tornadoes, earthquakes, 
and floods.
It is our collective responsibility as a Nation--nonprofit organizations 
and the public and private sectors--to implement effective standards and 
codes that sustain safe and resilient structures. We need innovation and 
partnerships at all levels of society to develop transformative 
breakthroughs in building materials and construction techniques that 
strengthen the integrity of our homes, workplaces, and commercial 
facilities.
Building safety and fire prevention officials, architects, engineers, 
design professionals, builders, and others in the construction industry 
work every day to ensure the sound construction of buildings and the 
safety of our citizens. Their efforts to construct or retrofit buildings 
that utilize state-of-the-art safety, energy efficiency, and fire 
prevention standards are important to our national resilience and our 
ability to compete in the 21st-century economy.
As a resilient Nation, we must continue to do everything in our power to 
enhance our ability to withstand and rapidly recover from natural and 
manmade disasters, disruptions, and emergencies.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2011 as National 
Building Safety Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, 
private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups 
to join in activities that will increase awareness of building safety, 
and I further urge Americans to learn more about how they can contribute 
to building safety at home and in their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.
BARACK OBAMA

Proclamation 8673 of May 12, 2011

Small Business Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our country started as an idea, and it took hard-working, dedicated, and 
visionary patriots to make it a reality. Successful businesses start 
much the same way--as ideas realized by entrepreneurs who dream of a 
better world and work until they see it through. From the family 
businesses that anchor Main Street to the high-tech startups that keep 
America on the cutting edge, small businesses are the backbone of our 
economy and the cornerstones of America's promise.
Throughout our economic recovery, persevering small businesses have 
helped put our country back on track. Countless new and saved jobs have 
come from small businesses who took advantage of tax relief, access to 
capital, and other tools in the Recovery Act, the Small Business Jobs 
Act, and other initiatives launched by my Administration to put 
Americans back to work. To ensure the stability of our recovery, we must 
continue to provide new opportunities for small business owners and the 
next generation of entrepreneurs, who will help us out-innovate our 
global competitors to win the future.
To support high-growth businesses, my Administration has launched 
Startup America, an initiative that will strengthen access to capital 
and mentoring while reducing barriers to growth for small businesses. 
Entrepreneurship is essential to the strength and resilience of our 
economy and our way of life. Startup America will give entrepreneurs the 
tools they need to build their business into the next great American 
company. To encourage innovation, we released the Strategy for American 
Innovation, a report outlining my Administration's plan to harness 
ingenuity. This means investing in the building blocks of innovation, 
like education and infrastructure, while promoting market-based growth 
through tax credits and effective intellectual property laws.
The National Export Initiative is working to open markets to American 
businesses and support small exporters, who increase American 
competitiveness abroad and create good jobs here at home. We continue to 
create opportunities for businesses in underserved communities through 
new lending initiatives, expanded access to counseling, and technical 
assistance. We are also working to provide small businesses more 
opportunities to compete for Federal contracts. This gives Federal 
agencies access to some of our country's best products and services 
while helping these businesses grow and employ community members. 
Through these and other initiatives, we are supporting the entrepreneurs 
and small businesses that provide work for half of American workers and 
create two out of every three new private sector jobs.
Small businesses embody the promise of America: that if you have a good 
idea and are willing to work hard enough, you can succeed in our 
country. This week, we honor and celebrate the individuals whose 
inspiration and efforts keep America strong.

[[Page 59]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 
2011, as Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the 
contributions of small businesses to the competitiveness of the American 
economy with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8674 of May 13, 2011

Emergency Medical Services Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each day, Americans rely on emergency medical service (EMS) systems to 
help them in their hour of greatest need. In communities across our 
Nation, we take comfort in knowing that well-trained, caring men and 
women are only a phone call away from treating injuries sustained in a 
car crash, responding to a cardiac emergency, or helping a child with 
asthma breathe easier. When accidents and illnesses strike unexpectedly, 
EMS personnel are the first on the scene, and their timely actions often 
make the difference between life and death.
Emergency medical technicians (EMTs), paramedics, and first responders 
serve on the front lines of our health care and public health system. 
Working with them are many others whose dedication makes the EMS system 
function, including emergency dispatchers, physicians, nurses, and 
researchers, as well as colleagues in the fire service and law 
enforcement. Our Nation's EMS system represents the American spirit at 
its best, with many ambulances in the United States partially or fully 
staffed by volunteers. They devote countless hours to keeping their 
communities, including often underserved rural areas, safe.
My Administration is committed to supporting the brave men and women who 
help keep America secure and resilient. This year, I signed the James 
Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act into law, ensuring that rescue 
and recovery workers, and others suffering from health consequences 
related to the World Trade Center disaster, have access to the medical 
monitoring and treatment they need and deserve. As a Nation, we must 
never forget the selfless courage demonstrated by the EMTs, paramedics, 
and first responders who risked their lives to save others.
During EMS Week, we recognize the importance of ensuring our Nation's 
children have full access to high-quality EMS care. Reauthorized in the 
Affordable Care Act, the Federal EMS for Children program works with 
public and private sector partners across the United States to make 
certain that all children--regardless of where they live, attend school, 
or travel--receive appropriate EMS care.

[[Page 60]]

EMS agencies are an integral part of our Nation's health security 
strategy, and they help to build community resilience by strengthening 
all aspects of the emergency response system. Whether responding by car, 
ambulance, helicopter, boat, or plane, this diverse group of dedicated 
Americans provides crucial pre-hospital medical care to fellow citizens 
when they need it most. This week, we take time to recognize the 
inspiring contributions of our Nation's EMS practitioners and honor 
their dedication to serving their country and fellow citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 
2011, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Americans to 
observe this occasion by sharing their support with their local EMS 
providers and taking steps to improve their personal safety and 
preparedness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8675 of May 13, 2011

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America has long depended on a robust and reliable transportation 
network to support our drive towards lasting security and prosperity. 
Our highways, railroads, ports, and airways allow us to move around our 
country quickly and efficiently. Effective transportation systems have 
helped our economy grow, our first responders save lives, and our Armed 
Forces mobilize.
The freedom of movement created by America's transportation 
infrastructure facilitates our Nation's economic vitality. Our ability 
to travel safely enables us to trade with our neighbors and visit our 
friends and family. It provides Americans from every corner of our 
country access to the first-rate products and services that define our 
economy, increasing the productivity of our people and our land. Our 
transportation system also permits our military to move personnel and 
supplies at a moment's notice. The ability to deploy rapidly empowers 
our men and women in uniform to respond to crises or natural disasters 
at home and abroad with urgency.
Maintaining the transportation networks that earlier generations 
bequeathed to us is a challenge, and we must do more than preserve the 
status quo. We need to develop a 21st-century transportation network--
one that is safer, more energy-efficient, more environmentally 
sustainable, and offers more transportation choices to our citizens than 
the one we inherited.

[[Page 61]]

As we celebrate the legacy of our Nation's transportation arteries, we 
recognize the world is now more connected and more competitive than ever 
before. New companies around the world look for the fastest and most 
reliable ways to move people and goods. To attract new businesses to our 
shores, we must rebuild crumbling roads and bridges and continue to 
invest in the modernization of our infrastructure. We must repair our 
highways, reengineer our railroads into high-speed rail networks, and 
ready ourselves for the next revolutionary breakthroughs in 
transportation technology. We must provide increased transportation 
options that cut commuting time, ease traffic congestion, reduce oil 
consumption, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and expand access to job 
opportunities and housing that American families can afford. Together, 
we can continue the work started by the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act to maintain a world-class logistics network, create new 
jobs, and win the future for our children.
In recognition of the importance of our Nation's transportation 
infrastructure, and of the men and women who build, maintain, and 
utilize it, the Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May 
16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the 
third Friday in May of each year as ``National Defense Transportation 
Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 
U.S.C. 133), that the week during which that Friday falls be designated 
as ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 20, 2011, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 15 through May 21, 2011, as National 
Transportation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the 
importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure and to 
acknowledge the contributions of those who build, operate, and maintain 
it.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8676 of May 13, 2011

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's public safety officers are heroes who risk their lives to 
keep our families and communities safe. Each of these brave men and 
women goes to work not knowing what dangers might lie ahead, making 
tremendous sacrifices to uphold justice and protect the innocent. This 
week, we extend our gratitude for their service to our country. We also 
remember those killed in the line of duty, and we mourn their loss and 
honor the loved ones they left behind.

[[Page 62]]

Our law enforcement personnel are dedicated to the communities they 
serve, working tirelessly to transform neighborhoods across our country. 
Despite facing budget constraints and daily threats, public safety 
officers embrace innovative approaches to improving our Nation and 
upholding the rule of law.
Public safety officers put their lives on the line to protect ours, 
sometimes making the ultimate sacrifice. One death is too many, and 
every death is an unfathomable loss to the officer's family, colleagues, 
and community. In the past year, we have seen a tragic wave of police 
officer fatalities, and have mourned the loss of too many public safety 
officers. This year also marks 10 years since the tragedy of September 
11. We will always remember the selfless courage shown by police 
officers, fire fighters, and first responders in New York City, 
Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon who rushed into unknown dangers to 
save the lives of others. Their service--and the service of all who have 
worn the badge--will never be forgotten.
While we can never adequately thank our law enforcement officers for 
their service, we can use every tool at our disposal to protect them on 
the job. My Administration is committed to stopping senseless tragedies 
and keeping our police safe. We will continue to provide funding for 
resources to keep cops on the street and to collaborate with law 
enforcement agencies and organizations to develop strategies that reduce 
injuries and deaths in the line of duty. We have also launched the new 
Preventing Violence Against Law Enforcement and Ensuring Officer 
Resilience and Survivability (VALOR) initiative, designed to reduce and 
prevent law enforcement officer injuries and line-of-duty deaths.
We know that bullet-resistant vests and body armor can save lives. After 
consulting with members of the law enforcement community, we instituted 
a new mandatory wear policy as part of our Bulletproof Vest Partnership 
program beginning this year. We will also continue to seek more 
efficient ways to share information and invest in evidence-based, smart-
on-crime approaches to fighting crime. Moreover, if tragedy does strike, 
we will provide support to the families of law enforcement officers.
As we commemorate Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we honor 
the discipline and distinction our peace officers have shown in 
conditions we can only imagine. They are continually called upon to 
remain vigilant and take courageous action. As a country, we promise to 
stand beside our public safety community and do our part to help keep 
America safe and secure.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 
676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the 
President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each 
year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the week in which it falls 
as ``Police Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2011, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 15 through May 21, 2011, as Police Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. I also call on Governors of the United States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject 
to the jurisdiction of the United States, and appropriate officials of 
all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff 
on Peace Officers Memorial Day.

[[Page 63]]

 I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff 
from their homes and businesses on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8677 of May 13, 2011

World Trade Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

American businesses embody the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that has 
defined our Nation since its founding, and they consistently reinvent 
themselves to adapt to changing times. As we recover from a historic 
economic recession, enterprising commercial leaders continue to look 
beyond our borders to supply the world with innovative and 
technologically advanced products and services. Millions of jobs in the 
United States are tied to exports, and our world continues to grow more 
interdependent.
World Trade Week is a time to highlight the vital connection between the 
global economy and the prosperity of our own country. Our 21st-century 
economy requires American businesses and workers to compete in an 
international marketplace. To ensure our success, we must advance a 
robust, forward-looking trade agenda that emphasizes exports and 
domestic job growth.
Last year, my Administration launched the National Export Initiative, an 
effort to marshal the full resources of the Federal Government behind 
America's businesses, large and small, and help them sell their goods, 
services, and ideas to the world. Though the United States remains a 
leading exporter, this Initiative is redoubling our efforts to ensure 
American companies have free and fair access in trade, and it is 
building on our successes in export-driven growth. Through this effort, 
we can help even more American companies grow, compete, and thrive in 
global markets and help reach our goal of doubling exports in 5 years by 
2015. In turn, those companies will be able to hire more American 
workers to produce the goods and services they sell to customers around 
the world.
By out-innovating, out-educating, and out-building the rest of the 
world, we can keep Americans working and export more of the high-quality 
products and services for which our workers and companies are admired. 
With a commitment to winning the future, we can continue to lead the 
world in attracting the jobs, businesses, and industries of tomorrow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 
2011, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate

[[Page 64]]

and inform Americans about the benefits of trade to our Nation and the 
global economy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8678 of May 18, 2011

National Maritime Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In times of peace or war, the civilians serving in the United States 
Merchant Marine have helped keep our Nation safe and prosperous. We 
depend on these men and women serving on our ships and tugs, in our 
ports and shipyards, close to home or far at sea, to connect businesses, 
service members, and citizens around the world. On National Maritime 
Day, we honor their invaluable contributions to America's economic 
strength and security.
On May 22, 1819, the SS Savannah completed the first successful voyage 
by a steam powered ship across the Atlantic, shepherding in a new age of 
maritime travel and transport. By the 20th century, the United States 
maritime trade was booming, fostering exchanges across the world and 
aiding our military at war. During World War II, Merchant Marines were 
critical in providing necessary supplies and services to troops abroad, 
while suffering an extraordinarily high death rate. Hundreds of merchant 
ships fell to enemy action, and nearly one in thirty mariners did not 
return home.
United States flag vessels and those who operate them continue to be an 
integral part of our military operations overseas. They support 
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as humanitarian aid missions 
and disaster relief efforts. Without the steadfast commitment of our 
mariners, our Nation would not be as prepared to deal with unforeseen 
events, conflicts, or crises. Their bravery and valor make our waterways 
safer and more efficient every day.
Today, our maritime industry is a valuable source of skilled employment 
for American workers, contributing billions of dollars to our economy. 
It is also a critical part of our transportation system. Last year, my 
Administration implemented ``America's Marine Highway Program,'' an 
effort that enables American businesses to participate in improving the 
safety and environmental sustainability of our waterways. Our mariners' 
continued work is helping American industry remain competitive in the 
global economy, pushing us toward a more prosperous and free 21st 
century.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day,'' and has 
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.

[[Page 65]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2011, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance and to 
display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their 
communities. I also request that all ships sailing under the American 
flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8679 of May 20, 2011

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Hurricane Preparedness Week highlights the importance of 
planning ahead to protect our families and secure our communities and 
homes in advance of the upcoming hurricane season.
Hurricanes are powerful storms that can create severe flooding, 
dangerous storm surges, high winds, and tornadoes. The effects of these 
storms can be devastating to entire communities and can have long-
lasting consequences, including loss of life and property. In addition 
to threatening coastal areas, hurricanes significantly impact inland 
locations. Our Nation has seen devastating hurricanes and storms, and we 
must not let our guard down as we prepare for this year's hurricane 
season. With tens of millions of Americans living in coastal 
communities, preparation can enhance our ability to respond to and 
recover from any natural disaster we might face.
Our Nation's weather forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's National Hurricane Center continue to improve the 
accuracy of their hurricane forecasts. However, we cannot prevent a 
hurricane from making landfall, and awareness of the threat is not 
enough--we must translate this knowledge into action, and work together 
to develop prepared and resilient communities. My Administration 
recognizes that we must move from a government-centric approach to 
disaster management to a community-oriented approach that includes all 
levels of government, the private sector, volunteers, community and 
faith-based organizations, and the public. A whole community effort is 
needed to effectively prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover 
from, and mitigate against any disaster.
During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, we emphasize the need for 
individuals, businesses, nonprofits, and families to prepare emergency 
plans, create emergency supply kits, and learn evacuation routes. More 
information on hurricane hazards and details on how to secure buildings 
and belongings is available at www.Hurricanes.gov/Prepare and 
www.Ready.gov.

[[Page 66]]

America has seen the heartbreak a hurricane can leave behind. By working 
together, government, private and nonprofit organizations, emergency 
responders, and private citizens can help save lives and reduce the 
damage caused by these storms.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 22 through May 28, 
2011, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government 
agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in the 
coastal areas of our Nation to share information about hurricane 
preparedness and response to help save lives and protect communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8680 of May 20, 2011

National Safe Boating Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans anticipate the warm weather of the summer months, we look 
to our Nation's abundant outdoors and waterways for relaxation and 
recreation. America's lakes, rivers, and oceans are enjoyable, but can 
sometimes pose dangers to watergoers. National Safe Boating Week is an 
opportunity to highlight the importance of safety precautions and 
sensible behavior when spending time on the water.
Safe boating is responsible boating. Individuals can prepare for 
excursions by taking boating safety courses and filing float plans with 
family members, relatives, or friends. To prevent accidents and drowning 
while on the water, boaters should remain aware of weather conditions, 
perform vessel safety checks, and ensure each passenger wears a life 
jacket and all required safety equipment is on board. Safe boating is 
also sober boating. Alcohol use is a leading factor in fatal boating 
accidents, so limiting alcohol use while on or operating a boat can save 
lives.
Each year for National Safe Boating Week, the United States Coast Guard 
partners with boating organizations to raise awareness on the importance 
of taking proper precautions while boating. By embracing responsible 
boating practices, Americans can avoid preventable injuries and enjoy 
the majesty of our Nation's waterways.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe 
Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2011, as National

[[Page 67]]

Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating 
activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating 
practices and taking advantage of boating education.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8681 of May 20, 2011

Armed Forces Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Armed Forces of the United States of America embody the highest 
ideals of our Nation. Serving at home and in posts around the world, our 
service members represent America as ambassadors of our principles. They 
display the honor, duty, and discipline of the finest fighting force the 
world has ever known. These brave men and women are willing to sacrifice 
their lives for the security of our Nation and the freedoms of their 
fellow citizens. We are humbled by their continued resolve to respond to 
the call of duty and defend America and its people.
From our earliest days as a fledgling republic, the United States has 
relied on the unwavering courage and patriotism of our men and women in 
uniform to sustain us through wars, emergencies, and challenges at home 
and abroad. While conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas demand 
an ever-changing set of capabilities and competencies, our service 
members continue to protect our Nation with professionalism and 
distinction.
As a grateful Nation, we are indebted to the members of our Armed Forces 
for their service, and we support them in each mission they are tasked 
to accomplish. I have no greater privilege as President of the United 
States than serving as Commander in Chief, and my Administration is 
dedicated to providing the men and women of our Armed Forces with the 
resources and support they require and deserve. We are also committed to 
providing the same superior support to our veterans when they return 
home. This is the sacred trust our Nation must hold with her warriors.
It is not just our troops who are called to serve and sacrifice, but 
also their families, who give our service members the love and support 
they need to carry on the fight. We will continue to improve and enhance 
our support for the families and survivors our troops leave behind. 
These heroes are dedicated to defending the country we love, and we must 
stand firmly beside them and help care for their spouses and children.
On Armed Forces Day, let us salute the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, 
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who perform their duties with impeccable 
courage, commitment, and character, and recognize our moral obligation 
to serve them and their families as well as they have served us.

[[Page 68]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United 
States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby 
proclaim the third Saturday of May as Armed Forces Day.
I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air 
Force, and Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on 
behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances, with the 
Secretary of Defense responsible for encouraging the participation and 
cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.
I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to 
provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day in an appropriate manner 
to increase public understanding and appreciation of our Armed Forces. I 
also invite veterans, civic leaders, and other organizations to join in 
the observance of Armed Forces Day.
Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United 
States at their homes on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn 
more about military service by attending and participating in the local 
observances of the day. I also encourage Americans to volunteer at 
organizations that provide support to our troops.
Proclamation 8522 of May 14, 2010, is hereby superseded.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8682 of May 23, 2011

To Modify the Rules of Origin for the United States-Singapore Free Trade 
Agreement, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On May 6, 2003, the President entered into the United States-
Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA). The USSFTA was approved by the 
Congress in section 101(a) of the United States-Singapore Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USSFTA Act'') (Public Law 108-78, 
117 Stat. 948) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note).
2. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
USSFTA with respect to the United States and, pursuant to the USSFTA 
Act, incorporated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(HTS) the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or 
appropriate to carry out the USSFTA.
3. Section 202 of the USSFTA Act provides rules for determining whether 
goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a 
USSFTA Party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment 
contemplated under the USSFTA. Section 202(o) authorizes the President 
to

[[Page 69]]

proclaim, as part of the HTS, the rules of origin set out in the USSFTA 
and to proclaim modifications to previously proclaimed rules of origin, 
subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) 
of the USSFTA Act.
4. The United States and Singapore have agreed to modify the USSFTA 
rules of origin by adding certain rules of origin. I have determined 
that modification of the USSFTA rules of origin set forth in 
Proclamation 7747 is therefore necessary.
5. On July 24, 2010, in accordance with section 103(a) of the USSFTA 
Act, the United States Trade Representative submitted a report to the 
Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Finance of the Senate that set forth the proposed 
modifications to the USSFTA rules of origin. The consultation and 
layover period specified in section 103(a) expired on November 22, 2010.
6. Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, modified the HTS 
pursuant to section 1206 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 
1988 (19 U.S.C. 3006) to conform the HTS to amendments to the 
International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and 
Coding System.
7. Presidential Proclamation 8214 of December 27, 2007, modified the 
HTS, including adjustments to rules of origin under the USSFTA to ensure 
that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods 
of Singapore under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 
continued, and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in 
Proclamation 7747. A rule of origin was inadvertently omitted from 
general note 25 of the HTS. I have determined that a technical 
correction to general note 25 to the HTS is necessary to provide for the 
intended tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USSFTA to 
originating goods of Singapore.
8. On April 12, 2006, the United States entered into the United States-
Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (USPTPA), and on June 24 and June 25, 
2007, the Parties to the USPTPA signed a protocol amending the USPTPA. 
The Congress approved the USPTPA as amended in section 101(a) of the 
United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the 
``USPTPA Act'') (Public Law 110-138, 121 Stat. 1455) (19 U.S.C. 3805 
note).
9. Section 201 of the USPTPA Act authorizes the President to proclaim 
such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of 
duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the 
President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or 
apply Articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.3.13 and Annex 2.3 of the USPTPA.
10. U.S. General Note 5 to Annex 2.3 of the USPTPA provides that 
originating goods of Peru shall not be subject to any duty provided for 
in heading 9901 of the HTS, provided that certain conditions specified 
in that note are met.
11. Pursuant to section 201 of the USPTPA Act, I have determined that 
modifications to the HTS are necessary to carry out U.S. General Note 5 
to Annex 2.3 of the USPTPA.
12. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the United

[[Page 70]]

States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``NAFTA Act'') (Public Law 103-182, 107 Stat. 
2057), incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and rules 
of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
13. Section 202 of the NAFTA Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides rules for 
determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in a 
NAFTA Party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment 
contemplated under the NAFTA.
14. Presidential Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, modified the HTS, 
including adjustments to rules of origin under the NAFTA, to ensure that 
the tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods of 
Canada and Mexico under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 
continued. Two technical errors were made in the modifications to 
general note 12 to the HTS. I have determined that technical corrections 
to general note 12 to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended 
tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the NAFTA to 
originating goods.
15. Presidential Proclamation 8536 of June 12, 2010, made technical 
corrections to certain rules of origin under the NAFTA. Two additional 
errors in general note 12 were not corrected in that proclamation. I 
have determined that further technical corrections to general note 12 
are necessary to provide the tariff and certain other treatment accorded 
under the NAFTA to originating goods.
16. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the 
relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts, affecting import 
treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including section 202 of the 
USSFTA Act, section 201 of the USPTPA Act, and section 604 of the Trade 
Act of 1974, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to modify the rules of origin under the USSFTA, general 
note 25 to the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I to this 
proclamation.
(2) The modifications made by section A of Annex I to this proclamation 
shall be effective with respect to goods of Singapore that are entered, 
or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after May 24, 2011.
(3) The modification made by section B of Annex I to this proclamation 
shall be effective with respect to goods of Singapore that are entered, 
or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after February 7, 
2008.
(4) In order to implement certain provisions of Annex 2.3 of the USPTPA, 
the HTS is modified as provided in Annex II to this proclamation.
(5) The modifications made by Annex II to this proclamation shall be 
effective with respect to originating goods of Peru entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2011.
(6) In order to make technical corrections necessary to provide the 
intended rules of origin under the NAFTA, the HTS is modified as set 
forth in Annex III to this proclamation.

[[Page 71]]

(7) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex III to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after October 2, 2009.
(8) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8683 of May 27, 2011

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For over two centuries, brave men and women have laid down their lives 
in defense of our great Nation. These heroes have made the ultimate 
sacrifice so we may uphold the ideals we all cherish. On this Memorial 
Day, we honor the generations of Americans who have fought and died to 
defend our freedom.
Today, all who wear the uniform of the United States carry with them the 
proud legacies of those who have made our Nation great, from the 
patriots who fought at Lexington and Concord to the troops who stormed 
the beaches at Normandy. Ordinary men and women of extraordinary courage 
have, since our earliest days, answered the call of duty with valor and 
unwavering devotion. From Gettysburg to Kandahar, America's sons and 
daughters have served with honor and distinction, securing our liberties 
and laying a foundation for lasting peace.
On this solemn day in which Americans unite in remembrance of our 
country's fallen, we also pray for our military personnel and their 
families, our veterans, and all who have lost loved ones. As a grateful 
Nation, we forever carry the selfless sacrifice of our fallen heroes in 
our hearts, and we share the task of caring for those they left behind.
In his second Inaugural Address, in the midst of the Civil War, 
President Lincoln called on our embattled Nation ``to care for him who 
shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan, to do 
all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among 
ourselves, and with all nations.'' On this Memorial Day, and every day, 
we bear a heavy burden of responsibility to uphold the founding 
principles so many died defending. I call on all Americans to come 
together to honor the men and women who gave their lives so that we may 
live free, and to strive for a just and lasting peace in our world.
In honor of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint 
resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has 
requested the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of 
the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for 
permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 
106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time 
for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of 
Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 30, 2011, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.

[[Page 76]]

I request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, 
to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this 
Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the 
United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I 
also request the people of the United States to display the flag at 
half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8684 of May 31, 2011

African-American Music Appreciation Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The music of our Nation has always spoken to the condition of our people 
and reflected the diversity of our Union. African-American musicians, 
composers, singers, and songwriters have made enormous contributions to 
our culture by capturing the hardships and aspirations of a community 
and reminding us of our shared values. During African-American Music 
Appreciation Month, we honor the rich musical traditions of African-
American musicians and their gifts to our country and our world.
From the cadenced hums of spirituals to the melodies of rhythm and 
blues, African-American music has been used to communicate, to 
challenge, to praise, and to uplift in times of both despair and 
triumph. The rhythmic chords embedded in spirituals have long expressed 
a deep faith in the power of prayer, and brought hope to slaves toiling 
in fields. The soulfulness of jazz and storytelling in the blues 
inspired a cultural renaissance, while the potent words of gospel gave 
strength to a generation that rose above the din of hatred to move our 
country toward justice and equality for all.
Today, African-American musicians continue to create new musical genres 
and transform the scope of traditional musical formats. The artistic 
depth of soul, rock and roll, and hip-hop not only bring together people 
across our Nation, but also energize and shape the creativity of artists 
around the world. The contributions of African-American composers and 
musicians to symphony, opera, choral music, and musical theater continue 
to reach new audiences and encourage listeners to celebrate fresh 
interpretations of these and other genres. In cherished songs passed 
down through generations and innovative musical fusions crafted today, 
African-American music continues to transcend time, place, and 
circumstance to provide a source of pride and inspiration for all who 
hear its harmonies. This month, we celebrate the legacy of African-
American music and its enduring power to bring life to the narrative of 
our Nation.

[[Page 77]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2011 as African-
American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month 
with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and foster 
appreciation of music which is composed, arranged, or performed by 
African Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8685 of May 31, 2011

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The story of America's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) 
community is the story of our fathers and sons, our mothers and 
daughters, and our friends and neighbors who continue the task of making 
our country a more perfect Union. It is a story about the struggle to 
realize the great American promise that all people can live with dignity 
and fairness under the law. Each June, we commemorate the courageous 
individuals who have fought to achieve this promise for LGBT Americans, 
and we rededicate ourselves to the pursuit of equal rights for all, 
regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
Since taking office, my Administration has made significant progress 
towards achieving equality for LGBT Americans. Last December, I was 
proud to sign the repeal of the discriminatory ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' 
policy. With this repeal, gay and lesbian Americans will be able to 
serve openly in our Armed Forces for the first time in our Nation's 
history. Our national security will be strengthened and the heroic 
contributions these Americans make to our military, and have made 
throughout our history, will be fully recognized.
My Administration has also taken steps to eliminate discrimination 
against LGBT Americans in Federal housing programs and to give LGBT 
Americans the right to visit their loved ones in the hospital. We have 
made clear through executive branch nondiscrimination policies that 
discrimination on the basis of gender identity in the Federal workplace 
will not be tolerated. I have continued to nominate and appoint highly 
qualified, openly LGBT individuals to executive branch and judicial 
positions. Because we recognize that LGBT rights are human rights, my 
Administration stands with advocates of equality around the world in 
leading the fight against pernicious laws targeting LGBT persons and 
malicious attempts to exclude LGBT organizations from full participation 
in the international system. We led a global campaign to ensure ``sexual 
orientation'' was included in the

[[Page 78]]

United Nations resolution on extrajudicial execution--the only United 
Nations resolution that specifically mentions LGBT people--to send the 
unequivocal message that no matter where it occurs, state-sanctioned 
killing of gays and lesbians is indefensible. No one should be harmed 
because of who they are or who they love, and my Administration has 
mobilized unprecedented public commitments from countries around the 
world to join in the fight against hate and homophobia.
At home, we are working to address and eliminate violence against LGBT 
individuals through our enforcement and implementation of the Matthew 
Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. We are also 
working to reduce the threat of bullying against young people, including 
LGBT youth. My Administration is actively engaged with educators and 
community leaders across America to reduce violence and discrimination 
in schools. To help dispel the myth that bullying is a harmless or 
inevitable part of growing up, the First Lady and I hosted the first 
White House Conference on Bullying Prevention in March. Many senior 
Administration officials have also joined me in reaching out to LGBT 
youth who have been bullied by recording ``It Gets Better'' video 
messages to assure them they are not alone.
This month also marks the 30th anniversary of the emergence of the HIV/
AIDS epidemic, which has had a profound impact on the LGBT community. 
Though we have made strides in combating this devastating disease, more 
work remains to be done, and I am committed to expanding access to HIV/
AIDS prevention and care. Last year, I announced the first comprehensive 
National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States. This strategy focuses 
on combinations of evidence-based approaches to decrease new HIV 
infections in high risk communities, improve care for people living with 
HIV/AIDS, and reduce health disparities. My Administration also 
increased domestic HIV/AIDS funding to support the Ryan White HIV/AIDS 
Program and HIV prevention, and to invest in HIV/AIDS-related research. 
However, government cannot take on this disease alone. This landmark 
anniversary is an opportunity for the LGBT community and allies to 
recommit to raising awareness about HIV/AIDS and continuing the fight 
against this deadly pandemic.
Every generation of Americans has brought our Nation closer to 
fulfilling its promise of equality. While progress has taken time, our 
achievements in advancing the rights of LGBT Americans remind us that 
history is on our side, and that the American people will never stop 
striving toward liberty and justice for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2011 as Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon the people of 
the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to 
celebrate the great diversity of the American people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8686 of May 31, 2011

National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The fabric of our Nation has been woven together and enriched by the 
diversity of our people. Our legacy as a Nation of immigrants is part of 
what makes America strong, and during National Caribbean-American 
Heritage Month, we celebrate the rich history and vibrant culture 
Caribbean Americans have brought to our shores.
Immigrants from Caribbean countries have come to America for centuries. 
Some came through the bondage of slavery. Others willfully left behind 
the world they knew in search of a better life. Regardless of the 
circumstances of their arrival, they had faith their descendants would 
have a chance to realize their greatest potential.
Caribbean Americans have prospered in every sector of our society and 
enhanced our national character while maintaining the multiethnic and 
multicultural traditions of their homelands. They are doctors and 
lawyers, public servants and scientists, and athletes and service 
members. Their successes inspire individuals in the United States and 
abroad, and we take pride in the contributions Caribbean Americans 
continue to make to the narrative of our Nation's progress. Their 
achievements are borne of hard work and ambition, and my Administration 
is committed to creating pathways to prosperity that ensure future 
generations of Caribbean Americans, along with all Americans, are able 
to pursue and realize the American dream.
This month, we also recognize the important friendship between the 
United States and the countries of the Caribbean as we expand our 
partnership to promote economic development, democratic governance, 
citizen security, and improved health and education in the region. 
Additionally, as Haiti continues to recover from last year's devastating 
earthquake, we remain committed to standing beside the people of Haiti 
as they rebuild their proud nation, and to working with others in the 
region to bring lasting prosperity and stability to the country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2011 as National 
Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I urge all Americans to commemorate 
this time when we celebrate the history and culture of Caribbean 
Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8687 of May 31, 2011

Great Outdoors Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For generations, America's great outdoors have ignited our imaginations, 
bolstered our economy, and fueled our national spirit of adventure and 
independence. The United States holds a stunning array of natural 
beauty--from sweeping rangelands and tranquil beaches, to forests 
stretching over rolling hills and rivers raging through stone-faced 
cliffs. During Great Outdoors Month, we rededicate ourselves to 
experiencing and protecting these unique landscapes and treasured sites.
As America's frontier diminished and our cities expanded, a few bold 
leaders and individuals had the foresight to protect our most precious 
natural and historic places. Today, we all share the responsibility to 
uphold their legacy of conservation, whether by protecting an iconic 
vast public land, or by creating a community garden or an urban park. 
Last year, I was proud to launch the America's Great Outdoors 
Initiative, a project that empowers Americans to help build a new 
approach to conservation and outdoor recreation. My Administration 
hosted dozens of regional listening sessions to collect ideas from 
people from across our country with a stake in the health of our 
environment and natural places. Our conversations with businesspeople, 
ranchers, hunters, fishermen, tribal leaders, students, and community 
groups led to a report unveiled in February, America's Great Outdoors: A 
Promise to Future Generations, which lays the foundation for smarter, 
more community-driven action to protect our invaluable natural heritage.
Our plan will restore and increase recreational access to public lands 
and waterways; bolster rural landscapes, including working farms and 
ranches; develop the next generation of urban parks and community green 
spaces; and create a new Conservation Service Corps so that young people 
can experience and restore the great outdoors. To implement these 
recommendations, my Administration is dedicated to building strong 
working relationships with State, local, and tribal governments, as well 
as community, private, and non-profit partners across America. The First 
Lady's ``Let's Move!'' initiative encourages youth to enjoy what our 
outdoors have to offer. These programs and partnerships will improve our 
quality of life and our health, rejuvenate local and regional economies, 
spur job creation, protect wildlife and historic places, and ensure our 
natural legacy endures for generations to come. All Americans can read 
the report and learn more at www.AmericasGreatOutdoors.gov.
As we commit to protecting our country's outdoor spaces, we also 
celebrate all they have to offer. Our public lands and other open areas 
provide myriad opportunities for families and friends to explore, play, 
and grow together--from hiking and wildlife watching to canoeing, 
hunting, and fishing, and playing in a neighborhood park. These 
activities can help our kids stay healthy, active, and energized, while 
reconnecting with their natural heritage. This month, let each of us 
resolve to protect our great outdoors; discover their wonders; and share 
them with our friends, our neighbors, and our children.

[[Page 81]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2011 as Great 
Outdoors Month. I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors and 
to uphold our Nation's legacy of conserving our lands for future 
generations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the

Proclamation 8688 of June 2, 2011

National Oceans Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Oceans Month, we celebrate the value of our oceans to 
American life and recognize the critical role they continue to play in 
our economic progress, national security, and natural heritage. 
Waterborne commerce, sustainable commercial fisheries, recreational 
fishing, boating, tourism, and energy production are all able to 
contribute to job growth and strengthen our economy because of the 
bounty of our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.
Last year, I signed an Executive Order directing my Administration to 
implement our Nation's first comprehensive National Policy for the 
Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes. This policy 
makes more effective use of Federal resources by addressing the most 
critical issues facing our oceans. It establishes a new approach to 
bringing together Federal, State, local, and tribal governments and all 
of the ocean's users--from recreational and commercial fishermen, 
boaters, and industry, to environmental groups, scientists, and the 
public--to better plan for, manage, and sustain the myriad human uses 
that healthy oceans, coasts, and the Great Lakes support.
One year after the devastating BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the 
Gulf of Mexico, we remain committed to the full environmental and 
economic recovery of the region. My Administration is assessing and 
mitigating the damage that was caused by this tragedy, and restoring and 
strengthening the Gulf Coast and its communities. These efforts remind 
us of the responsibility we all share for our oceans and coasts, and the 
strong connection between the health of our natural resources and that 
of our communities and economy. While we embrace our oceans as crucial 
catalysts for trade, bountiful sources of food, and frontiers for 
renewable energy, we must also recommit to ensuring their safety and 
sustainability, and to being vigilant guardians of our coastal 
communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2011 as National

[[Page 82]]

Oceans Month. I call upon Americans to take action to protect, conserve, 
and restore our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8689 of June 10, 2011

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On June 14, 1777, the Second Constitutional Congress adopted a flag with 
thirteen stripes and thirteen stars to represent our Nation, one star 
for each of our founding colonies. The stars were set upon a blue field, 
in the words of the Congress's resolution, ``representing a new 
constellation'' in the night sky. What was then a fledgling democracy 
has flourished and expanded, as we constantly strive toward a more 
perfect Union.
Through the successes and struggles we have faced, the American flag has 
been ever present. It has flown on our ships and military bases around 
the world as we continue to defend liberty and democracy abroad. It has 
been raised in yards and on porches across America on days of 
celebration, and as a sign of our shared heritage. And it is lowered on 
days of remembrance to honor fallen service members and public servants; 
or when tragedy strikes and we join together in mourning. Our flag is 
the mark of one country, one people, uniting under one banner.
When the American flag soars, so too does our Nation and the ideals it 
stands for. We remain committed to defending the liberties and freedoms 
it represents, and we give special thanks to the members of the Armed 
Forces who wear our flag proudly. On Flag Day, and during National Flag 
Week, we celebrate the powerful beacon of hope that our flag has become 
for us all, and for people around the world.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and 
for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution 
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President 
annually issue a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and call upon citizens of the United 
States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2011, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 12, 2011, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by displaying the flag. I also call upon the people of the 
United

[[Page 83]]

States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag 
Day through Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 
211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public 
gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8690 of June 17, 2011

Father's Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Parenthood is the ultimate gift and an incredible responsibility. Every 
day, fathers across our country give everything they have to build a 
better future for their family, asking nothing in return but their 
children's love and success. On Father's Day, we honor the men in our 
lives who have helped shape us for the good, and we recommit to 
supporting fatherhood in our families, in our communities, and across 
our Nation.
Fathers, along with our mothers, are our first teachers, coaches, and 
advisors. They help us grow into adults, consoling us in times of need 
and celebrating with us in times of triumph. Strong male role models 
come in all forms, but they have one thing in common: they show up and 
give it their best. A father figure may be a biological father, or he 
may be a surrogate father who raises, mentors, or cares for another's 
child. Every family is different, but what matters is the unconditional 
support, guidance, and love fathers and mentors give us throughout life.
Today, too many children in our country grow up without such support and 
guidance. A father's absence is felt by children, families, and 
communities in countless ways, leaving a hole that can have lasting 
effects. Their absence is also felt by mothers, who work overtime and 
double shifts, put food on the table, and care for children alone while 
trying to make ends meet. And it is felt in our communities, when boys 
grow up without male leaders to inspire them.
My Administration has made supporting fathers and their communities a 
priority. Last year on Father's Day, I announced the President's 
Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative, a nationwide effort to support 
organizations that foster responsible fatherhood and help re-engage 
fathers in the lives of their children. We have bolstered community and 
faith-based programs that provide valuable support networks for fathers. 
We are also promoting work-life balances that benefit families, and 
partnering with businesses across America to create opportunities for 
fathers and their children to spend time together. And military leaders 
are joining in our efforts to help families keep in touch when a dad is 
deployed overseas, so the fathers who serve to protect all our children 
can stay connected to their own.

[[Page 84]]

On Father's Day, we celebrate the men who make a difference in the life 
of a child, and we pay tribute to all the fathers who have been our 
guiding lights. In the days ahead, we recommit ourselves to making 
fatherhood, and the support men need to be fathers, a priority in our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 19, 
2011, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the 
Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government 
buildings on this day, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fifth.

Proclamation 8691 of July 1, 2011

40th Anniversary of the 26th Amendment

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Forty years ago, the 26th Amendment to the United States Constitution 
took effect, lowering the universal voting age in America from 21 years 
to 18 years. Millions of young Americans were extended the right to 
vote, empowering more young people than ever before to help shape our 
country. On this anniversary, we remember the commitment of all those 
who fought for the right to vote and celebrate the contributions of 
young adults to our Nation.
The right to vote has been secured by generations of leaders over our 
history, from the women's groups of the early 20th century to the civil 
rights activists of the 1960s. For young people, the movement to lower 
America's voting age took years of hard work and tough advocacy to make 
the dream a reality. Yet, once proposed in Congress in 1971, the 26th 
Amendment was ratified in the shortest time span of any Constitutional 
Amendment in American history.
In the midst of the Vietnam War, our Nation bestowed upon our young 
people the ability to change the status quo and entrusted them with a 
new voice in government. Today, young adults across America continue to 
exercise this enormous responsibility of citizenship. Countless young 
people are involved in the political process, dedicated to ensuring 
their voices are heard.
Ideas from young Americans are important to my Administration, and they 
will help shape the future of our Nation. We are committed to supporting 
and developing young leaders from all beliefs and backgrounds, and from 
urban and rural communities alike. This year, I launched ``100 Youth 
Roundtables,'' an initiative to facilitate substantive dialogue between 
my Administration and young Americans. We hosted a Young Entrepreneur

[[Page 85]]

Summit to listen to budding entrepreneurs and better assess their needs. 
And this summer, we are beginning a ``How to Make Change'' series for 
young Americans from all walks of life who are seeking change in their 
communities and our world.
Young adults have been a driving force for change in the last century, 
bringing new ideas and high hopes to our national dialogue. Today, we 
remember the efforts of those who fought for their seat at the table, 
and we encourage coming generations to claim their place in our 
democracy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 1, 2011, as the 
40th Anniversary of the 26th Amendment. I call upon all Americans to 
participate in ceremonies and activities that honor young Americans, and 
those who have fought for freedom and justice in our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of July, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

Proclamation 8692 of July 15, 2011

Captive Nations Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary 
people yearning for freedom ignite the desires of people everywhere. 
Such brave actions led to the birth of our Nation, the fall of the 
Soviet Union, and countless other achievements that have shaped our 
world. During Captive Nations Week, we remember the men and women 
throughout the world still suffering under oppressive regimes, and we 
underscore our commitment to advancing freedom's cause.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first Captive Nations Week 
Proclamation in 1959 amidst an escalating Cold War, affirming America's 
support for the individual liberties of those living under Communist 
oppression. Our world has transformed dramatically since President 
Eisenhower first proclaimed Captive Nations Week. The burst of freedom 
following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet 
Union led to the emergence of new democracies that are now steadfast 
allies of the United States and key contributors to the expansion of 
human rights worldwide.
With each generation, people have breathed new life into democratic 
ideals, striving for personal freedom, political and economic reform, 
and justice. The United States stands firmly behind all those who seek 
to exercise their basic human rights. We will continue to oppose the use 
of violence and repression and support the universal rights of freedom 
of religion, expression, and peaceful assembly; equality for men and 
women under the rule of law; and the right of people to choose their 
leaders.

[[Page 86]]

This week, we rededicate ourselves to promoting democratic values, 
economic development, and respect for human dignity, and we express our 
solidarity with freedom-seeking people everywhere whose future reflects 
our greatest hope for peace.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 17 through July 23, 2011, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to reaffirm 
our deep commitment to all those working for human rights and dignity 
around the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011

Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United Nations Security Council 
Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In light of the firm commitment of the United States to the preservation 
of international peace and security and our obligations under the United 
Nations Charter to carry out the decisions of the United Nations 
Security Council imposed under Chapter VII, I have determined that it is 
in the interests of the United States to suspend the entry into the 
United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of aliens who are subject 
to United Nations Security Council travel bans as of the date of this 
proclamation. I have further determined that the interests of the United 
States are served by suspending the entry into the United States, as 
immigrants or nonimmigrants, of aliens whose property and interests in 
property have been blocked by an Executive Order issued in whole or in 
part pursuant to the President's authority under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the authority vested in me as 
President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, including section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act

Proclamation 8694 of July 25, 2011

Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Generations of Americans with disabilities have improved our country in 
countless ways. Refusing to accept the world as it was, they have torn 
down the barriers that prohibited them from fully realizing the American 
dream. Their tireless efforts led to the enactment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA), one of the most comprehensive pieces of civil 
rights legislation in our Nation's history. On this day, we celebrate 
the 21st anniversary of the ADA and the progress we have made, and we 
reaffirm our commitment to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans.
Each day, people living with disabilities make immeasurable 
contributions to the diversity and vitality of our communities. Nearly 
one in five Americans lives with a disability. They are our family 
members and friends, neighbors and colleagues, and business and civic 
leaders. Since the passing of the ADA, persons with disabilities are 
leading fuller lives in neighborhoods that are more accessible and have 
greater access to new technologies. In our classrooms, young people with 
disabilities now enjoy the same educational opportunities as their peers 
and are gaining the tools necessary to reach their greatest potential.
Despite these advancements, there is more work to be done, and my 
Administration remains committed to ending all forms of discrimination 
and upholding the rights of Americans with disabilities. The Department 
of Justice continues to strengthen enforcement of the ADA by ensuring 
that persons with disabilities have access to community-based services 
that allow them to lead independent lives in the communities of their 
choosing. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, insurers will no 
longer be able to engage in the discriminatory practice of denying 
coverage based on pre-existing conditions, and Americans with 
disabilities will have greater control over their health care choices. 
And last year, I signed an Executive Order establishing the Federal 
Government as a model employer for individuals with disabilities, 
placing a special focus on recruitment and retention of public servants 
with disabilities across Federal agencies.
Through the ADA, America was the first country in the world to 
comprehensively declare equality for citizens with disabilities. To 
continue promoting these principles, we have joined in signing the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. At its core, this 
Convention promotes equality. It seeks to ensure that persons with 
disabilities enjoy the same rights and opportunities as all people, and 
are able to lead their lives as do other individuals.
Eventual ratification of this Convention would represent another 
important step in our forty-plus years of protecting disability rights. 
It would offer us a platform to encourage other countries to join and 
implement the Convention. Broad implementation would mean greater 
protections and benefits abroad for millions of Americans with 
disabilities, including our veterans, who travel, conduct business, 
study, reside, or retire overseas. In encouraging other countries to 
join and implement the Convention, we also could

[[Page 92]]

help level the playing field to the benefit of American companies, who 
already meet high standards under United States domestic law. Improved 
disabilities standards abroad would also afford American businesses 
increased opportunities to export innovative products and technologies, 
stimulating job creation at home.
Equal access, equal opportunity, and the freedom to make of our lives 
what we will are principles upon which our Nation was founded, and they 
continue to guide our efforts to perfect our Union. Together, we can 
ensure our country is not deprived of the full talents and contributions 
of the approximately 54 million Americans living with disabilities, and 
we will move forward with the work of providing pathways to opportunity 
to all of our people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, July 26, 
2011, the Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I 
encourage Americans across our Nation to celebrate the 21st anniversary 
of this civil rights law and the many contributions of individuals with 
disabilities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8695 of July 26, 2011

National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On June 25, 1950, the Korean peninsula erupted in conflict, becoming the 
front line of an intensifying Cold War. For 3 years, our Armed Forces 
fought to help keep Korea free, suffering bitter reversals and winning 
stunning victories before the Military Armistice Agreement at Panmunjom 
secured the border near the 38th parallel. Together, American service 
members and allied forces were part of a generation that, in the words 
inscribed at their memorial in Washington, defended ``a country they 
never knew and a people they never met.'' Today, we express our unending 
gratitude to all who fought and died in pursuit of freedom and democracy 
for the Korean peninsula.
Our veterans' courage and sacrifice have enabled the Republic of Korea 
to flourish as a strong and prosperous nation for over half a century. 
In the decades following the Armistice, the American and South Korean 
people have maintained a warm friendship, and our alliance is stronger 
than ever. We remember our common values and shared suffering during the 
Korean War, and we continue to work together towards advancing the cause 
of freedom and stability in East Asia and around the world.
Today, we honor the tens of thousands of service members who gave their 
last full measure of devotion to protect the people of the Republic of 
Korea.

[[Page 93]]

 We also pay tribute to the generations of Americans who have guarded 
the border since hostilities concluded. It is our sacred duty as a 
grateful Nation to care for all those who have served, and to provide 
for our veterans and their families.
We will never forget that America owes its liberty, security, and 
prosperity to the heroic acts of our service members. We must also 
remember that their selfless sacrifices have had a profound impact on 
the promotion of freedom across the globe. On National Korean War 
Veterans Armistice Day, we recommit to supporting our venerable warriors 
and their families, and we pay our deepest respects to those who laid 
down their lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2011, as 
National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor 
our distinguished Korean War Veterans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8696 of July 27, 2011

World Hepatitis Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our Nation, millions of Americans are living with viral 
hepatitis. As many as three-fourths of Americans living with the disease 
are unaware of their status and are not receiving care and treatment for 
their condition. Raising awareness about hepatitis is crucial to 
effectively fight stigmas, stem the tide of new infections, and ensure 
treatment reaches those who need it. On World Hepatitis Day, we join 
with people across our country and around the globe in promoting 
strategies that will help save lives and prevent the spread of viral 
hepatitis.
Viral hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, and can cause a lifetime 
of health issues for people who contract it. Hepatitis B and C viruses 
are the cause of a growing number of new liver cancer cases and liver 
transplants. In the United States, hepatitis is a leading infectious 
cause of death, claiming the lives of thousands of Americans each year. 
While we have come far, work still needs to be done to prevent and treat 
this disease.
Viral hepatitis touches Americans of all backgrounds, but certain groups 
are at greater risk than others. Past recipients of donated blood, 
infants born to mothers infected with viral hepatitis, and persons with 
sexually transmitted diseases or behaviors such as injection-drug use 
have risks for viral hepatitis. Baby boomers and African Americans have 
higher rates than others of contracting hepatitis C. Half of all 
Americans living with hepatitis B today are of Asian American and 
Pacific Islander descent, and one-third

[[Page 94]]

of people living with HIV also have either hepatitis B or hepatitis C. 
Worldwide, one in twelve people is living with viral hepatitis.
We must make sure that this ``silent epidemic'' does not go unnoticed by 
health professionals or by communities across our country. Under the 
Affordable Care Act, services including hepatitis immunizations for 
adults and hepatitis screenings for pregnant women are fully covered by 
all new insurance plans. My Administration has also released a 
comprehensive Action Plan for the Prevention, Care and Treatment of 
Viral Hepatitis. The plan brings together expertise and tools across 
government to coordinate our fight against this deadly disease. Our goal 
is to reduce the number of new infections, increase status awareness 
among people with hepatitis, and eliminate the transmission of hepatitis 
B from mothers to their children.
The first step toward achieving these goals is raising public awareness 
of this life-threatening disease. We must work to reduce the stigma 
surrounding hepatitis, and to ensure that testing, information, 
counseling, and treatment are available to all who need it. The hard 
work and dedication of health-care professionals, researchers, and 
advocates will help bring us closer to this goal. On this day, we renew 
our support for those living with hepatitis, and for their families, 
friends, and communities who are working to create a brighter, healthier 
future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 28, 2011, as 
World Hepatitis Day. I encourage citizens, Government agencies, 
nonprofit organizations, and communities across the Nation to join in 
activities that will increase awareness about hepatitis and what we can 
do to prevent it.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8697 of August 4, 2011

Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who 
Participate in Serious Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Violations and 
Other Abuses

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United States enduring commitment to respect for human rights and 
humanitarian law requires that its Government be able to ensure that the 
United States does not become a safe haven for serious violators of 
human rights and humanitarian law and those who engage in other related 
abuses. Universal respect for human rights and humanitarian law and the 
prevention of atrocities internationally promotes U.S. values and 
fundamental U.S. interests in helping secure peace, deter aggression, 
promote the rule of law, combat crime and corruption, strengthen 
democracies, and prevent

[[Page 95]]

humanitarian crises around the globe. I therefore have determined that 
it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict 
the international travel and to suspend the entry into the United 
States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of certain persons who have 
engaged in the acts outlined in section 1 of this proclamation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the authority vested in me as 
President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, including section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and 
nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons described in 
section 1 of this proclamation would be detrimental to the interests of 
the United States. I therefore hereby proclaim that:
Section 1. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or 
nonimmigrants, of the following persons is hereby suspended:
    (a) Any alien who planned, ordered, assisted, aided and abetted, 
committed or otherwise participated in, including through command 
responsibility, widespread or systematic violence against any civilian 
population based in whole or in part on race; color; descent; sex; 
disability; membership in an indigenous group; language; religion; 
political opinion; national origin; ethnicity; membership in a 
particular social group; birth; or sexual orientation or gender 
identity, or who attempted or conspired to do so.
    (b) Any alien who planned, ordered, assisted, aided and abetted, 
committed or otherwise participated in, including through command 
responsibility, war crimes, crimes against humanity or other serious 
violations of human rights, or who attempted or conspired to do so.
Sec. 2. Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply with respect to 
any person otherwise covered by section 1 where the entry of such person 
would not harm the foreign relations interests of the United States.
Sec. 3. The Secretary of State, or the Secretary's designee, in his or 
her sole discretion, shall identify persons covered by section 1 of this 
proclamation, pursuant to such standards and procedures as the Secretary 
may establish.
Sec. 4. The Secretary of State shall have responsibility for 
implementing this proclamation pursuant to such procedures as the 
Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, may 
establish.
Sec. 5. For any person whose entry is otherwise suspended under this 
proclamation entry will be denied, unless the Secretary of State 
determines that the particular entry of such person would be in the 
interests of the United States. In exercising such authority, the 
Secretary of State shall consult the Secretary of Homeland Security on 
matters related to admissibility or inadmissibility within the authority 
of the Secretary of Homeland Security.
Sec. 6. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to derogate from 
United States Government obligations under applicable international 
agreements, or to suspend entry based solely on an alien's ideology, 
opinions, or beliefs, or based solely on expression that would be 
considered protected under U.S. interpretations of international 
agreements to which the United States is a party. Nothing in this 
proclamation shall be construed to limit the authority of the United 
States to admit or to suspend entry of

[[Page 96]]

particular individuals into the United States under the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) or under any other provision of 
U.S. law.
Sec. 7. This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
Sec. 8. This proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in 
effect until such time as the Secretary of State determines that it is 
no longer necessary and should be terminated, either in whole or in 
part. Any such termination shall become effective upon publication in 
the Federal Register.

Proclamation 8698 of August 5, 2011

National Health Center Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our Nation, over 19 million Americans look to community health 
centers for medical checkups, education, advice, and critical services 
that keep them healthy. Throughout National Health Center Week, we 
recommit to supporting this vital resource for underserved communities, 
and we recognize the critical role community health centers play in our 
health-care system.
Every day, men, women, and children find help at community health 
centers. These centers lead the way in providing high-quality services 
at an affordable cost, while lifting up the quality of life for their 
patients. We see the results among Medicaid beneficiaries--those 
receiving care from a health center are less likely to be unnecessarily 
hospitalized or visit an emergency room. We also see the effects in 
rural areas with community health centers, where hospitals see fewer 
uninsured emergency room visits. These health centers are easy to 
access--Americans can find a health center near them by using the ``Find 
a Health Center'' tool at www.HRSA.gov.
My Administration continues to support these centers. Between the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Affordable Care Act, new 
funding has been committed to support technology and infrastructure 
updates to existing centers, as well as the construction of new ones. 
These laws also provided for important new initiatives that will benefit 
all Americans. The Affordable Care Act provided for the Health Centers 
Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration project, which will use 
community health centers to test the impact of team-based treatment 
approaches on the care of elderly patients.

[[Page 97]]

Across our vast and diverse land, Americans have always made it their 
duty to serve their neighbors in need. It is the common interest and 
purpose of building a stronger, healthier Nation that drives the work of 
community health centers and fuels our efforts to improve our health-
care system. During National Health Center Week, we celebrate the 
contributions of community health centers, and we rededicate ourselves 
to advancing the well-being of all our people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of August 7 
through August 13, 2011, as National Health Center Week. I encourage all 
Americans to celebrate this week by visiting their local community 
health center, meeting local health center providers, and exploring the 
programs they offer to help keep their families healthy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8699 of August 25, 2011

Women's Equality Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution tore down the last 
formal barrier to women's enfranchisement in our Nation and empowered 
America's women to have their voices heard in the halls of power. This 
Amendment became law only after decades of work by committed 
trailblazers who fought to extend the right to vote to women across 
America. For the women who fought for this right, voting was not the end 
of the journey for equality, but the beginning of a new era in the 
advancement of our Union. These brave and tenacious women challenged our 
Nation to live up to its founding principles, and their legacy inspires 
us to reach ever higher in our pursuit of liberty and equality for all.
Before the Amendment took effect, women had been serving our Nation in 
the public realm since its earliest days. Even before they gained the 
right to vote, America's women were leaders of movements, academics, and 
reformers, and had even served in the Congress. Legions of brave women 
wrote and lectured for change. They let their feet speak when their 
voices alone were not enough, protesting and marching for their 
fundamental right to vote in the face of heckling, jail, and abuse. 
Their efforts led to enormous progress--millions upon millions of women 
have since used the power of the ballot to help shape our country.
Today, our Nation's daughters reap the benefits of these courageous 
pioneers while paving the way for generations of women to come. But work 
still remains. My Administration is committed to advancing equality for 
all of our people. This year, the Council of Women and Girls released 
``Women

[[Page 98]]

in America: Indicators of Social and Economic Well-Being,'' the most 
comprehensive report in 50 years on the status of women in our country, 
shedding light on issues women face in employment, crime, health, and 
family life. We are working to ensure that women-owned businesses can 
compete in the marketplace, that women are not discriminated against in 
healthcare, and that we redouble our efforts to bring an end to sexual 
assault on college campuses.
On the 91st anniversary of this landmark in civil rights, we continue to 
uphold the foundational American principles that we are all equal, and 
that each of us deserves a chance to pursue our dreams. We honor the 
heroes who have given of themselves to advance the causes of justice, 
opportunity, and prosperity. As we celebrate the legacy of those who 
made enormous strides in the last century and before, we renew our 
commitment to hold true to the dreams for which they fought, and we look 
forward to a bright future for our Nation's daughters.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2011, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
celebrate the achievements of women and recommit ourselves to the goal 
of gender equality in this country.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8700 of August 31, 2011

National Preparedness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Whenever our Nation has been challenged, the American people have 
responded with faith, courage, and strength. This year, natural 
disasters have tested our response ability across all levels of 
government. Our thoughts and prayers are with those whose lives have 
been impacted by recent storms, and we will continue to stand with them 
in their time of need. This September also marks the 10th anniversary of 
the tragic events of September 11, 2001, which united our country both 
in our shared grief and in our determination to prevent future 
generations from experiencing similar devastation. Our Nation has 
weathered many hardships, but we have always pulled together as one 
Nation to help our neighbors prepare for, respond to, and recover from 
these extraordinary challenges.
In April of this year, a devastating series of tornadoes challenged our 
resilience and tested our resolve. In the weeks that followed, people 
from all walks of life throughout the Midwest and the South joined 
together to help affected towns recover and rebuild. In Joplin, 
Missouri, pickup trucks became ambulances, doors served as stretchers, 
and a university transformed

[[Page 99]]

itself into a hospital. Local businesses contributed by using trucks to 
ship donations, or by rushing food to those in need. Disability 
community leaders worked side-by-side with emergency managers to ensure 
that survivors with disabilities were fully included in relief and 
recovery efforts. These stories reveal what we can accomplish through 
readiness and collaboration, and underscore that in America, no problem 
is too hard and no challenge is too great.
Preparedness is a shared responsibility, and my Administration is 
dedicated to implementing a ``whole community'' approach to disaster 
response. This requires collaboration at all levels of government, and 
with America's private and nonprofit sectors. Individuals also play a 
vital role in securing our country. The National Preparedness Month 
Coalition gives everyone the chance to join together and share 
information across the United States. Americans can also support 
volunteer programs through www.Serve.gov, or find tools to prepare for 
any emergency by visiting the Federal Emergency Management Agency's 
Ready Campaign website at www.Ready.gov or www.Listo.gov.
In the last few days, we have been tested once again by Hurricane Irene. 
While affected communities in many States rebuild, we remember that 
preparedness is essential. Although we cannot always know when and where 
a disaster will hit, we can ensure we are ready to respond. Together, we 
can equip our families and communities to be resilient through times of 
hardship and to respond to adversity in the same way America always 
has--by picking ourselves up and continuing the task of keeping our 
country strong and safe.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2011 as 
National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans to recognize the 
importance of preparedness and observe this month by working together to 
enhance our national security, resilience, and readiness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8701 of August 31, 2011

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Recovering from addiction to alcohol and other drugs takes strength, 
faith, and commitment. Men and women in recovery showcase the power each 
of us holds to transform ourselves, our families, and our communities. 
As people share their stories and celebrate the transformative power of 
recovery, they also help dispel myths and stigmas surrounding substance 
abuse and offer hope for lifestyles free from alcohol and other drugs.

[[Page 100]]

This month and throughout the year, we must promote recovery and support 
the growth of healthy, resilient individuals and families in the United 
States. Today, alcohol and other drugs threaten the future of millions 
of Americans. Abuse of prescription medication has reached epidemic 
levels, drunk and drugged driving pose significant threats to public 
safety, and individuals in recovery continue to confront barriers to 
full participation in our society. My Administration is committed to 
reducing substance abuse, and this year we released our 2011 National 
Drug Control Strategy, which supports successful, long-term recoveries 
through research, education, increased access to treatment, and 
community-based recovery support.
As a Nation, we must strive to promote second chances and recognize each 
individual's ability to overcome adversity. We laud and support the 
millions of Americans in recovery from substance abuse, their loved 
ones, and the communities that help them sustain recovery, while 
encouraging those in need to seek help. As we celebrate National Alcohol 
and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we pay tribute to the transforming 
power of recovery, which will continue to heal individuals and 
communities across our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority invested in me by the Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2011 as 
National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the 
people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8702 of August 31, 2011

National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since the 1970s, the rate of childhood obesity in our country has 
tripled, and today a third of American children are overweight or obese. 
This dramatic rise threatens to have far-reaching, long-term effects on 
our children's health, livelihoods, and futures. Without major changes, 
a third of children born in the year 2000 will develop Type 2 diabetes 
during their lifetimes, and many others will face obesity-related 
problems like heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and asthma. As 
a Nation, our greatest responsibility is to ensure the well-being of our 
children. By taking action to address the issue of childhood obesity, we 
can help America's next generation reach their full potential.
Together, we can stop this epidemic in its tracks. Over the last year 
and a half, the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative has brought together 
Federal agencies and some of the biggest corporations and nonprofits 
from across

[[Page 101]]

our country, working to meet our national goal of solving the problem of 
childhood obesity within a generation. Let's Move! aims to help ensure 
we can make healthy choices about the foods we eat and how much exercise 
we get, while building the habits necessary to tackle one of the most 
urgent health issues we face in this country. I invite all Americans to 
visit LetsMove.gov to learn more about this initiative and how to help 
children eat healthy and stay active.
Everyone has a role to play in preventing and reversing the tide of 
childhood obesity. This year, we announced groundbreaking partnerships 
with grocery stores and other retailers to increase access to healthy 
food in underserved areas. These stores have pledged to increase their 
fruit and vegetable offerings and to open new locations in communities 
where nutritious food is limited or unavailable. Childhood obesity cuts 
across all cultural and demographic lines, so Let's Move! has started 
initiatives to reach every cross-section of America, from urban and 
rural areas to schools, health clinics, and child care homes and 
centers. These programs touch everyone, from faith-based communities to 
Indian Country, empowering kids and their families to discover the fun 
in healthy eating and exercise.
Schools also have an important role in ensuring our children live full 
and active lives. Last December, I signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids 
Act into law, enacting comprehensive change that will allow more 
children to eat healthier school lunches. One of the cornerstones of 
Let's Move! is the HealthierUS School Challenge. This year, America met 
the goal of doubling the number of schools meeting the Challenge's 
requirements for expanding nutrition and physical activity 
opportunities. These 1,250 schools have shown that together, we can go 
above and beyond to give our kids the healthy future they deserve.
We are coordinating across the Federal Government to make our goal a 
reality. This year, the Federal Government released updated Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans, providing a science-based roadmap for 
individuals to make healthy choices, and emphasizing the importance of 
good nutrition and an active lifestyle. We adapted the food pyramid to a 
new design--MyPlate--to encourage balanced meals. And our Healthy People 
2020 initiative incorporates childhood obesity prevention in its goals 
for increasing the health of all Americans.
Across our country, parents are working hard every day to make sure 
their kids are healthy, and my Administration is committed to supporting 
families in their efforts. During National Childhood Obesity Awareness 
Month, we recognize the outstanding work our businesses, communities, 
and families are doing to help us meet our responsibilities to our 
children. I urge all Americans to help us meet our goal of solving the 
problem of childhood obesity within a generation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2011 as 
National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month. I encourage all Americans to 
take action by learning about and engaging in activities that promote 
healthy eating and greater physical activity by all our Nation's 
children.

Proclamation 8703 of September 1, 2011

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ovarian cancer continues to have one of the highest mortality rates of 
any cancer, and it is a leading cause of cancer deaths among women in 
the United States. This month, we remember the mothers, sisters, and 
daughters we have lost to ovarian cancer, and we extend our support to 
those living with this disease. We also reaffirm our commitment to 
raising awareness about ovarian cancer, and to advancing our screening 
and treatment capabilities for the thousands of American women who will 
be diagnosed this year.
Ovarian cancer touches women of all backgrounds and ages. Because of a 
lack of early symptoms and effective screening tests, ovarian cancer is 
often not detected in time for successful interventions. It is crucial 
that women know how to recognize the warning signs of gynecological 
cancers and can detect the disease as early as possible. I encourage all 
women to learn about risk factors, including family history, and to 
discuss possible symptoms, including abdominal pain, with their doctor. 
Now, because of the Affordable Care Act, a wide range of preventive 
screenings are available to women without any copayments, deductibles, 
or coinsurance.
My Administration is committed to supporting the women, families, and 
professionals working to end this disease. The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services 
have started a campaign to educate women on cancers affecting 
reproductive organs. The National Cancer Institute is researching new 
ways to detect ovarian cancer, publishing a comprehensive study of the 
most aggressive types of ovarian cancer, and conducting clinical trials 
for new combinations of therapy. And this year, agencies across the 
Federal Government, from the National Institutes of Health to the 
Department of Defense, have committed to supporting ovarian cancer 
prevention and treatment research.
So many lives have been touched by ovarian cancer--from the women who 
fight this disease, to the families who join their loved ones in 
fighting their battle. In the memory of all the brave women who have 
lost their lives to ovarian cancer, and in support of generations of 
women to come, let us recommit to reaching a safer, healthier future for 
all our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2011 as 
National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon citizens, 
government agencies, organizations, health-care providers, and research 
institutions to

[[Page 103]]

raise ovarian cancer awareness and continue helping Americans live 
longer, healthier lives. And I urge women across the country to talk to 
their health-care providers and learn more about this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8704 of September 1, 2011

National Wilderness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The mystery and wonder of wilderness is deeply rooted in our national 
character. For many of the first Americans--American Indians and Alaska 
Natives--the wilderness provided a source of sustenance and a foundation 
for their ways of life. Later, as explorers and the pioneers of a young 
country moved west, they found adventure and new beginnings in the 
landscapes of our Nation.
As we continue our country's proud journey and explore new opportunities 
in the 21st century, the importance of maintaining our wilderness has 
only grown. Protecting our wilderness areas and their riches--clean 
water, stretches of undisturbed land, thriving wildlife, and healthy 
ecosystems--is critical to the health of our environment and our 
communities. Today, wilderness areas serve as places for us to roam, 
hunt, fish, and find solitude. They are also strong engines of local 
economies, providing tourism and recreation revenue for communities.
To help preserve our natural surroundings, I established the America's 
Great Outdoors Initiative to advance a conservation agenda for the 21st 
century, with ideas stemming directly from the American people. We are 
working with State, local, and tribal communities to support community-
driven initiatives that embody the values and character of our 
wilderness heritage and other landscapes. And in recognition of the 
importance of our wilderness, my Administration has expanded protected 
wilderness areas by 2 million acres.
From our earliest days, America's identity has been tied to the powerful 
waterfalls, soaring peaks, and vast plains of its land. As a people, we 
are defined by its diversity and empowered by its richness. This month, 
we honor this land that we love, and commit to ensuring our wilderness 
remains a place where all can experience the spirit that has shaped 
America. During National Wilderness Month, let each of us embrace our 
Nation's legacy of protecting and preserving our vast wilderness for 
generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 104]]

the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2011 as 
National Wilderness Month. I invite all Americans to visit and enjoy our 
wilderness areas, to learn about their vast history, and to aid in the 
protection of our precious national treasures.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8705 of September 1, 2011

National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across America, thousands of courageous children fight pediatric cancer 
each year, facing life-threatening battles that would challenge men and 
women of any age. They are cared for by loving families, friends, and 
communities who band together to support children in times of great 
need. From raising money for research and hospital stays to offering 
compassionate assistance to families who have lost loved ones, Americans 
are working every day to combat childhood cancer.
Today, research advances have made pediatric cancer more treatable than 
ever before. The five-year survival rate for young patients has risen to 
80 percent in the past half century, but serious challenges remain. 
Children who survive cancer frequently struggle with significant 
complications later in life and researchers are working to develop 
treatments specifically for pediatric cancer. We still know too little 
about the causes in young people, and cancer remains the leading cause 
of death by disease for children in America under the age of 15.
As we work to better understand and combat these destructive diseases, 
my Administration is working to lift some of the burden on families 
affected by them. Because of the Affordable Care Act, insurance 
companies can no longer deny insurance to children because of pre-
existing conditions, meaning that children who are currently suffering 
from or have survived cancer must be covered. Insurance companies are 
also banned from rejecting insurance for children participating in 
clinical studies, in which the vast majority of children with cancer 
take part. And the Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance companies 
from imposing lifetime dollar limits on health benefits--freeing cancer 
patients and their families from worry of long-term treatment 
affordability. Meanwhile, the National Cancer Institute continues to 
conduct and fund research on the causes of these diseases, linking 
research on genetics and adult cancers to more effective treatments for 
children.
Too many children and their families have faced the harmful effects of 
cancer. In memory of the young lives taken from us far too soon, and in 
honor of the families who stood beside them, we continue to support 
researchers,

[[Page 105]]

doctors, and advocates working to improve treatments, find cures, and 
reach a tomorrow where all our children can lead full and healthy lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2011 as 
National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. I also encourage all 
Americans to join me in reaffirming our commitment to fighting childhood 
cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8706 of September 1, 2011

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
among men in the United States. The weight of this illness is felt not 
only by the men living with and fighting prostate cancer, but also by 
their families, friends, and communities who rally to care for their 
loved ones. As we observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we 
renew our commitment to reducing the impact of prostate cancer on our 
country by raising awareness and supporting research that will lead to 
better ways to detect and treat this disease.
Although the exact causes of prostate cancer are not yet known, studies 
show certain factors--including age, race, and family history--may 
increase the likelihood of developing the disease. African Americans, in 
particular, are at a higher risk than men of other backgrounds. I 
encourage all men, especially those who are at an increased risk, to 
talk to their doctors about ways they can reduce their chances of 
developing prostate cancer.
My Administration will continue to promote prostate cancer research and 
treatment and raise awareness of this illness. The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention support critical research projects and education 
activities that bring a public health perspective to the issues of early 
detection and treatment. The Department of Defense and the National 
Cancer Institute continue to support research, investigate new cancer 
detection methods, and develop innovative imaging methods and other 
diagnostic techniques. The Affordable Care Act also expands coverage and 
gives Americans greater freedom and control over their health-care 
choices. Reforms in the law ban insurance companies from dropping 
individuals when they get sick or imposing lifetime dollar limits on 
health benefits. These changes free cancer patients to focus on getting 
better instead of worrying about whether they will be able to afford 
their treatment.
During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we reaffirm our support 
for prostate cancer patients and survivors, and commend health-care 
providers, advocates, and researchers for their dedication and 
perseverance.

[[Page 106]]

 Our combined efforts to increase awareness of prostate cancer and 
bolster research will help save lives, and our commitment to our 
fathers, brothers, and sons will contribute to a brighter tomorrow for 
future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2011 as 
National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, 
government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and 
other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and 
prevention of prostate cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8707 of September 2, 2011

Labor Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, hard-working men and women across America prove that, even in 
difficult times, our country is still home to the most creative, 
dynamic, and talented workers in the world. Generations of working 
people have built this country--from our highways and skylines, to the 
goods and services driving us in the 21st century. On Labor Day and 
throughout the year, we celebrate our Nation's workers, and we commit to 
supporting their efforts in moving our economy forward.
The right to organize and collectively bargain is a fundamental American 
value. Since its beginnings in our country, organized labor has raised 
our living standards and built our middle class. It is the reason we 
have a minimum wage, weekends away from work to rest and spend time with 
family, and basic protections in our workplaces. Many Americans today 
are given opportunities because their parents and grandparents fought 
for these basic rights and values. The principles upheld by the 
honorable laborers of generations past and their unions continue to fuel 
the growth of our economy and a strong middle class.
This year has seen a vigorous fight to protect these rights and values, 
and on this Labor Day, we reaffirm that collective bargaining is a 
cornerstone of the American dream. From public employees--including 
teachers, firefighters, police, and others who perform public services--
to workers in private industries, these men and women hold the power of 
our Nation in their hands.
In the last several years, we have pulled our country back from the 
brink, through a series of tough economic decisions. While we have come 
far, great challenges still face us. Many Americans are still 
struggling, and many are unemployed. My Administration is working 
tirelessly each day to promote policies that get Americans back to work. 
We will always strive

[[Page 107]]

to keep our fundamental promise that, in America, anyone who works hard 
and acts responsibly can provide a better future for their children. 
When we come together, there is no limit to what the American workforce 
can do.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 5, 2011, as 
Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United 
States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities that acknowledge the tremendous contributions of working 
Americans and their families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8708 of September 9, 2011

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ten years ago, a bright September day was darkened by the worst 
terrorist attack on America in our Nation's history. On this tenth 
anniversary of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, we lift in 
prayer and remembrance the men, women, and children who died in New York 
City, in Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon, and we honor the countless 
heroes who responded to senseless violence with courage and compassion. 
We continue to stand with their families and loved ones, while striving 
to ensure the legacy of those we lost is a safer, stronger, and more 
resilient Nation.
Since that day, a generation has come of age bearing the burden of war. 
The 9/11 Generation of service members and their families has stepped up 
to defend our security at home and abroad. They volunteer, knowing they 
might be sent into harm's way, and they uphold the virtues of 
selflessness and sacrifice that have always been at the center of our 
Nation's strength. We pay humble tribute to all those who serve in our 
Armed Forces, and to the thousands of brave Americans who have given 
their last full measure of devotion during this difficult decade of war.
First responders, law enforcement officials, service members, 
diplomats--the range of Americans who have dedicated themselves to 
building a safer world is awe-inspiring. We have put unprecedented 
pressure on those who attacked us 10 years ago and put al-Qa'ida on the 
path to defeat. Around the globe, we have joined with allies and 
partners to support peace, security, prosperity, and universal rights. 
At home, communities have come together to make us a stronger country, 
united by our diversity, our character, and our enduring principles.
Today, our Nation still faces great challenges, but this last decade has 
proven once more that, as a people, we emerge from our trials stronger 
than

[[Page 108]]

before. During these days of prayer and remembrance, a grateful Nation 
gives thanks to all those who have given of themselves to make us safer. 
And in memory of the fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers 
and sisters, and friends and loved ones taken from us 10 years ago, let 
us join again in common cause to build a more hopeful world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 9 
through Sunday, September 11, 2011, as National Days of Prayer and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States honor and 
remember the victims of September 11, 2001, and their loved ones through 
prayer, contemplation, memorial services, the visiting of memorials, the 
ringing of bells, evening candlelight remembrance vigils, and other 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I invite people around the world 
to participate in this commemoration.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8709 of September 9, 2011

National Grandparents Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The support of loved ones provides the earliest and often most powerful 
influence on our lives. Grandparents hold a special place in our 
families, serving as elders, caregivers, and sources of lasting 
inspiration. On National Grandparents Day, we honor the loving presence 
of these mentors who have contributed immeasurably to the strength of 
our families and our Nation.
As a country, we understand our welfare is determined by that of all 
Americans, and it is our responsibility to provide for our grandparents 
as they have for us. We must keep Social Security strong and viable, 
while preserving it for future generations. We must strengthen Medicare 
by making common-sense changes that encourage high-quality care and 
address wasteful spending. After a lifetime of contributions to our 
Nation and its economy, seniors have earned this support.
Today, our grandparents continue to serve their communities in many 
ways. Their spirit of service and warm guidance instill in each of us 
the values of community and compassion and inspire all of us to reach 
for ever greater heights.
The greatest generation built America into a global force for 
prosperity, opportunity, and freedom. They taught us that with hard 
work, sacrifice, and a determined spirit, anything is possible. Today, 
we honor their contributions to our Nation and its proud story.

[[Page 109]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2011, as 
National Grandparents Day. I call upon all Americans to take the time to 
honor their own grandparents and those in their community.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8710 of September 9, 2011

Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the 
American people demonstrated that in times of hardship, the values that 
define us do not simply endure--they are stronger than ever. As a 
Nation, we responded to unthinkable tragedy with an outpouring of 
service and goodwill. On that dark day, first responders rushed into a 
burning Pentagon and climbed the stairs of smoking towers on the verge 
of collapse, while citizens risked their own health and safety to 
prevent further heartbreak and destruction. As Americans, we came 
together to help our country recover and rebuild.
Today, we pay tribute to the selfless heroes and innocent victims of 
September 11, 2001, and we reaffirm the spirit of patriotism, service, 
and unity that we felt in the days and months that followed. By 
volunteering our time and unique skills, we can enrich communities 
across our country, and together, we can strengthen our Nation to meet 
the challenges of the 21st century.
In the days to come, I ask all Americans to join together in serving 
their communities and neighborhoods in honor of the victims of the 
September 11 attacks. Today and throughout the year, scores of Americans 
answer the call to make service a way of life--from helping the homeless 
to teaching underserved students to bringing relief to disaster zones. I 
encourage all Americans to visit Serve.gov, or Servir.gov for Spanish 
speakers, to learn more about service opportunities across our country.
As we join in serving causes greater than ourselves and honoring those 
we lost, we are reminded of the ways that the victims of 9/11 live on--
in the people they loved, the lives they touched, and the courageous 
acts they inspired. On Patriot Day and National Day of Service and 
Remembrance, we pledge to carry on their legacy of courage and 
compassion, and to move forward together as one people.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as ``Patriot 
Day,'' and

[[Page 110]]

by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress has 
requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized 
``National Day of Service and Remembrance.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2011, as Patriot Day and 
National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, 
agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag 
of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of 
Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives 
on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and interested organizations and 
individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the 
United States to participate in community service in honor of those our 
Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of 
silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the 
innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of

Proclamation 8711 of September 12, 2011

National Health Information Technology Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Technological advances have always driven America's economy forward and 
improved the lives of our people, from the industrial innovations of the 
nineteenth century to today's cutting-edge science. Progress in our 
Nation's health care system is no different, and hinges on the work of 
hospitals, private practices, and information specialists as they 
modernize our health information systems. During National Health 
Information Technology Week, we highlight the critical importance of 
secure and efficient information systems to improving the delivery of 
health care in the United States.
Health information technology connects doctors and patients to more 
complete and accurate health records. Tools like electronic health 
records and electronic prescriptions help patients and providers make 
safer, smarter decisions about health care. This technology is critical 
to improving patient care, enabling coordination between providers and 
patients, reducing the risk of dangerous drug interactions, and helping 
patients access prevention and disease management services. It is 
currently being used with great success to coordinate and improve care 
for members of our Armed Forces, as well as our Nation's veterans. 
Better technology can also cut costs for providers by reducing paperwork 
and duplicative tests.

[[Page 111]]

Ensuring the security of health information records is a top priority 
for my Administration. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, 
passed in 2009, promotes the use of Health IT while significantly 
strengthening Federal laws protecting patient privacy. Entities 
violating privacy laws are now subject to increased penalties. The 
Recovery Act also provides landmark financial incentives to eligible 
professionals and hospitals that adopt and meaningfully use electronic 
health records while protecting the privacy and security of health 
information.
Everyone can play a role in improving our health care system. An 
important part of this vision is recognizing the pivotal role patients 
play in maintaining and improving their own health. Patients can work 
with their doctors to access information about their care. And those who 
design and implement Health IT systems can enable software that puts 
patients and their families at the center of their own care, empowering 
and engaging them in reaching their health goals.
America is home to the world's best universities and technical schools, 
and the most creative scientists and entrepreneurs. As we challenge 
ourselves to push forward into a new century of health technology, we 
will continue to foster and promote the innovative spirit that has made 
our country what it is today.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 11 through 
September 17, 2011, as National Health Information Technology Week. I 
urge all Americans to learn more about the benefits of Health IT by 
visiting HealthIT.gov, take action to increase adoption and meaningful 
use of Health IT, and utilize the information Health IT provides to 
improve the quality, safety, and cost effectiveness of health care in 
the United States.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8712 of September 15, 2011

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From those who trace their roots to America's earliest days to those who 
recently came to the United States carrying nothing but hope for a 
better life, Hispanics have always been integral to our national story. 
As an American family more than 300 million strong, we constitute one 
people, sharing sacrifice and prosperity because we know we rise and 
fall together. America is a richer and more vibrant country because of 
the contributions of Hispanics, and during National Hispanic Heritage 
Month, we celebrate the immeasurable impact they have made on our 
Nation.

[[Page 112]]

Hispanics have had a profound and positive influence on our country 
through their strong commitment to family, faith, hard work, and 
service. They have enhanced and shaped our national character with 
centuries-old traditions that reflect the multiethnic and multicultural 
customs of their community. They are doctors and lawyers, activists and 
educators, entrepreneurs and public servants, and brave service members 
who defend our way of life at home and abroad.
My Administration is dedicated to ensuring America remains a land of 
opportunity for all. Our economic strength depends on the success of 
Hispanic families across our country, and I am determined to put workers 
of all backgrounds back on the job to rebuild and modernize America, 
while helping small businesses grow and creating pathways to employment. 
We are also engaging the Hispanic community in public service, improving 
educational opportunities, and expanding access to affordable, quality 
health care. And we remain committed to fixing our broken immigration 
system so it can meet America's 21st century economic and security 
needs.
The future of America is inextricably linked to the future of our 
Hispanic community. Our country thrives on the diversity and ingenuity 
of all our people, and our ability to out-innovate, out-educate, and 
out-build the rest of the world will depend greatly on the success of 
Hispanics. This month, as we honor their struggles and successes, let us 
recommit to ensuring our Nation remains a place big enough and bold 
enough to accommodate the dreams and prosperity of all our people.
To honor the achievements of Hispanics in America, the Congress by 
Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the 
President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 
through October 15 as ``National Hispanic Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2011, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs 
under this year's theme, ``Renewing the American Dream.''
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8713 of September 15, 2011

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In every conflict in which our Nation has been involved, selfless 
American service members have sacrificed their lives for the sake of our 
country and its principles. Too many have never come home, or have 
endured unthinkable hardship as prisoners of war. On this day, we echo 
the creed inscribed

[[Page 113]]

on the black and white banners that fly in honor of America's Prisoners 
of War and Missing in Action, and we renew our promise to our heroes, 
that ``You Are Not Forgotten.''
We will never give up the search for those who are held as prisoners of 
war or have gone missing under our country's flag. We honor their 
sacrifice, and we must care for their families and pursue the fullest 
possible accounting for all missing members of our Armed Forces. 
Together, we must serve our Nation's patriots as well as they have 
served us--by supporting them when they come home, and by carrying on 
the legacy of those who do not. This is a promise we keep for our 
fallen, for our veterans past and present, and for all those whose loved 
ones have not returned from the battlefield.
On September 16, 2011, the stark black and white banner symbolizing 
America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will be flown over the 
White House, the United States Capitol, the Departments of State, 
Defense, and Veterans Affairs, the Selective Service System 
Headquarters, the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Veterans 
Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, United States post offices, 
national cemeteries, and other locations across our country. We raise 
this flag as a solemn reminder of our obligation to always remember the 
sacrifices made to defend our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16, 2011, as 
National POW/MIA Recognition Day, and I urge all Americans to observe 
this day of honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8714 of September 16, 2011

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the summer of 1787, delegates from the States gathered in 
Philadelphia to build a new framework for our young republic. Our 
Constitution's Framers represented diverse backgrounds, and on key 
issues, they were divided. Yet despite their differences, they 
courageously joined together in common purpose to create ``a more 
perfect Union.'' After 4 months of fierce debate and hard-fought 
compromise, the delegates signed the Constitution of the United States.
For more than two centuries, the Constitution has presided as the 
supreme law of the land, keeping our leaders true to America's highest 
ideals and

[[Page 114]]

guaranteeing the fundamental rights that make our country a beacon of 
hope to all peoples seeking freedom and justice. Together with the Bill 
of Rights, our Constitution is the backbone of our government and the 
basis of our liberties. Even while retaining its structure, our founding 
document has grown with our Nation's conscience, amended over the years 
to extend America's promise to citizens of every race, gender, and 
creed.
Americans are defined not by bloodlines or allegiance to any one leader 
or faith, but by our shared ideals of liberty, equality, and justice 
under the law. We are a Nation of immigrants, built and sustained by 
people who have brought their talents, drive, and entrepreneurial spirit 
to our shores. Generations of newcomers have journeyed to this land 
because they believed in what our country stands for.
Every year, thousands of candidates for citizenship commemorate 
Constitution Day and Citizenship Day by becoming American citizens. 
These men and women have respected our laws and learned our history, and 
some have served in our military. Today, we invite them to join us in 
writing the next great chapter of the American story.
In signing the Constitution, the Framers provided a model of American 
leadership for generations to come. Through controversy and division, 
they built a lasting structure of government that began with the words, 
``We the People.'' This week, as we celebrate our Founders' timeless 
vision, we resolve to stay true to their spirit of patriotism and unity.
In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 
U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 
108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 
17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2011, as Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2011, as 
Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as 
well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to 
conduct ceremonies and programs that bring together community members to 
reflect on the importance of active citizenship, recognize the enduring 
strength of our Constitution, and reaffirm our commitment to the rights 
and obligations of citizenship in this great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8715 of September 16, 2011

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since September 11, 2001, the 9/11 Generation has borne the burden of 
war with courage and valor, continuing the legacy of the brave men and 
women who served before them. More than five million volunteers have 
worn our country's uniform over the past 10 years, and thousands have 
given their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Making up nearly half of our 
military power, the National Guard and Reserve are vital to our 
operations at home and abroad.
During America's struggle for independence, ordinary individuals in 
small towns across the colonies banded together to confront an empire. 
Today, their spirit lives on in the Guard and Reserve. The members of 
our National Guard and Reserve demonstrate the dignity and selflessness 
that are at the core of the American spirit. These patriots serve not 
only in combat, but also when disaster strikes at home, offering a 
strong hand to victims of floods, tornadoes, and fires across America.
The employers who provide jobs to our Guard and Reserve members when 
they are home are also vital to our success. Many of these businesses go 
above and beyond, offering tremendous support to service members and 
their families during deployments. We are deeply grateful for their 
work, and this week, we celebrate not only our service members, 
veterans, and military families, but also their devoted employers.
The extraordinary service of our Guard and Reserve members would not be 
possible without the unwavering support and care provided by their 
families and civilian employers. To help connect our service members, 
veterans, and their families to the opportunities they deserve, the 
First Lady and Dr. Jill Biden announced Joining Forces, a comprehensive 
national initiative to support and honor these patriots. As part of this 
initiative, we issued a challenge to private sector employers to hire or 
train 100,000 unemployed veterans or their spouses. We have also 
proposed tax credits for businesses that hire our returning heroes--they 
fought for our country, and the last thing they should have to do is 
fight for a job when they come home.
This week, we remember our obligations to each other, and we pay tribute 
to the employers of our Guardsmen and Reservists whose support and 
flexibility is vital to the strength of our military. The United States 
is at its strongest when we live up to our sacred duty to honor and care 
for our service members when they come home. The support of employers 
across our country reflects the best of the American spirit--the 
understanding that we are bound together to serve and protect our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through

[[Page 116]]

September 24, 2011, as National Employer Support of the Guard and 
Reserve Week. I call upon all Americans to join me in expressing our 
heartfelt thanks to the members of the National Guard and Reserve and 
their civilian employers. I also call on State and local officials, 
private organizations, and all military commanders, to observe this week 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8716 of September 16, 2011

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The food, fiber, and fuel generated by our agricultural sector are vital 
to America's 21st-century economy. Farmers represent the best of the 
American dream--passing on proud traditions of hard work and commitment 
to their children. This week, we celebrate farmers' contributions to the 
fabric of our Nation as they cultivate the products that sustain us, 
serve as stewards of our environment, and stand as the backbone of 
communities across our country.
The self-discipline and determination of farm communities have allowed 
them to persevere through drought, storms, and hard times, always 
emerging strong and vibrant. Each day, our farmers, ranchers, and 
agricultural workers face multiple dangers. They work with heavy 
machinery, livestock, and toxic materials, and in potentially dangerous 
environments like grain elevators and processing facilities. Physically 
demanding and all-encompassing, farm work requires the resourcefulness 
and grit that has been essential to our Nation's success. This week, we 
pay tribute to the tremendous work ethic of America's farmers, and 
encourage safe farm practices for all.
Supporting farmers, ranchers, and growers is critical to creating and 
sustaining a thriving economy. My Administration has worked to create 
new markets for these products, and to provide assistance to farms, 
supporting jobs across our country. We continue to work to make capital 
more accessible and help aspiring young farmers buy land. Farms are 
critical to achieving our goal of doubling our exports, and American 
agricultural exports are now worth over $100 billion a year. They are 
also the source of biofuels that will help lead us to energy 
independence. My Administration is working to speed the development of 
next-generation biofuels, and their production will benefit farmers, 
rural communities, and Americans across our country.

[[Page 117]]

As the fall harvest begins, I encourage farm and ranch families to 
embrace safe farming practices and to participate in farm safety and 
health programs. Communities and neighbors can support local farmers by 
understanding the risks involved with farm work and the role everyone 
can play in preventing and responding to accidents. We are grateful for 
the fruits of every farmer's labor, and we honor their tireless 
dedication to the well-being of their families and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through 
September 24, 2011, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the agencies, organizations, businesses, and extension services that 
serve America's agricultural workers to strengthen their commitment to 
promoting farm safety and health programs. I also urge Americans to 
honor our agricultural heritage and express appreciation to our farmers, 
ranchers, and farm-workers for their remarkable contributions to our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8717 of September 16, 2011

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 150 years ago, courageous men and women took great risks and 
made extraordinary sacrifices to establish our country's first African-
American colleges and universities. These institutions remain at the 
forefront of providing educational opportunities to young people across 
our country today. During National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week, we pay homage to the daring leaders who laid the 
foundation for these institutions, and we reaffirm our commitment to 
ensuring Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) remain 
pathways to realizing the American dream.
Founded by visionaries, HBCUs have given generations of students a sense 
of their heritage, their history, and their place in the American 
narrative. They have produced many of our Nation's leaders in business, 
government, academia, and the military. Today, we recognize them as the 
crucibles of learning, where a young legal student discovered the sense 
of purpose that led him to the Supreme Court, a young broadcaster with a 
unique name gained the foundation to build an empire, and a young 
preacher grew into a king who shared his dream with the world.
HBCUs continue a proud tradition as vibrant centers of intellectual 
inquiry and engines of scientific discovery and innovation. New waves of 
students, faculty, and alumni are building on their rich legacies and 
helping America

[[Page 118]]

achieve our goal of once again leading the world in having the highest 
proportion of college graduates by 2020. This week, as we celebrate the 
vast contributions HBCUs have made to our Nation, we are reminded of 
their role in fulfilling a great American truth--that equal access to a 
quality education can open doors for all our people. By continuing to 
strengthen HBCUs, we ensure they remain beacons of hope for future 
generations of Americans who will move our country closer to the ideals 
of our founding.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through 
September 24, 2011, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon educators, public officials, professional 
organizations, corporations, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities 
that acknowledge the numerous contributions these institutions and their 
alumni have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8718 of September 21, 2011

National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

To win the future and restore our position as the global leader in 
education, we must ensure all young Americans, regardless of background, 
have the opportunity to realize their full potential. As our Nation's 
largest minority group, Hispanics represent more than 11 million 
students in America's public elementary and secondary schools. During 
National Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) Week, we renew our 
commitment to strengthening and expanding opportunities in higher 
education for our next generation of Hispanic leaders.
The hundreds of HSIs across our country are helping Hispanic students 
gain access to a quality higher education. These institutions play an 
essential role in equipping students with the skills necessary to thrive 
in the 21st century. Graduates of HSIs are leaders in science, 
technology, engineering, and math--fields that are crucial to America's 
competitiveness in an increasingly global economy. As hubs of research 
and innovation, they are integral to helping us achieve our goal of 
having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.
Last year, I renewed and enhanced the White House Initiative on 
Educational Excellence for Hispanics to improve educational outcomes for 
Hispanic students from pre-school through higher education and adult 
education. We are working to expand access to pre-kindergarten programs 
and reduce high school drop-out rates for Hispanic students, while 
recruiting

[[Page 119]]

more Hispanic teachers and school leaders. Building on this foundation, 
we are committed to strengthening the capacity of HSIs and other higher 
education institutions serving Hispanic students to provide the best 
education possible.
This week, as we celebrate the immeasurable contributions HSIs have made 
to our Nation, we are reminded that in this new century, America will 
only be as strong as the opportunities we provide to all our people. Our 
future is inextricably tied to the future of the Hispanic community, and 
by working to strengthen HSIs, we will secure a brighter tomorrow for 
our children, helping them reach for the dream that has come to define 
our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through 
September 24, 2011, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week. I 
call on public officials, educators, and all the people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities that acknowledge the tremendous contributions these 
institutions and their graduates have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8719 of September 22, 2011

National Public Lands Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

At the dawn of the 20th century, President Theodore Roosevelt embarked 
on a tour of the American West that forever changed our Nation's 
relationship with the outdoors. His visits to Yellowstone, Yosemite, the 
Grand Canyon, and other natural wonders instilled in him a commitment to 
conservation, and they motivated him to designate millions of acres of 
protected land. Today, our public lands system is a model of 
conservation and an important resource for clean energy, grazing, and 
recreation--vital economic engines in both rural and urban communities.
On National Public Lands Day, we take time to appreciate our parks, 
national forests, wildlife refuges, and other public spaces, and we 
recommit to protecting and restoring them for future generations. This 
year, thousands of dedicated volunteers will continue a proud American 
tradition by conserving and restoring our public lands with local 
projects across our Nation. Americans will restore hiking trails, remove 
invasive plant species, clean lakes, and pick up litter in city parks. 
Through their service, families and children will find opportunities for 
outdoor activity on the millions of acres of national forests, parks, 
and trails.
To maintain our environmental heritage and build a responsive 
conservation and recreation agenda, my Administration launched the 
America's

[[Page 120]]

Great Outdoors Initiative last year. We met with thousands of Americans 
in listening sessions across our country, and compiled the results of 
this national conversation in the report, America's Great Outdoors: A 
Promise to Future Generations. To act on these findings, we are 
undertaking projects in collaboration with State, local, and tribal 
governments to responsibly steward the lands that belong to all 
Americans. First Lady Michelle Obama also joined in support of getting 
Americans outside when the Let's Move! initiative, in coordination with 
the Department of the Interior, launched Let's Move Outside! to help 
families exercise in the great outdoors.
Countless Americans have experienced the same awe and wonder that 
President Roosevelt felt on his westward journey. By joining in this 
legacy of conservation, Americans young and old protect not only our 
lands, but also the promise that future generations will be able to 
carry forward the spirit of adventure that lies at the heart of our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24, 2011, as 
National Public Lands Day. I encourage all Americans to participate in a 
day of public service for our lands.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8720 of September 23, 2011

National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On vast plains and through dense forests, along rocky riverbanks and 
atop tranquil lakes, Americans of every age and background cherish their 
connection to the great outdoors. As we mark National Hunting and 
Fishing Day, we are reminded of the uniquely American idea that each of 
us has an equal share in the land around us and an equal responsibility 
to protect it.
America's hunters and anglers directly experience the endless beauty and 
reward of our Nation's bounty. We have long depended on this land to 
sustain us, from our Native American ancestors and the settlers on the 
Eastern Seaboard to the sportsmen and women of today. Fishing and 
hunting are traditions that span untold lengths of time, enabling 
important bonds to the land and between generations to form. Sportsmen 
also develop unique connections to the land they enjoy, and hunters and 
fishermen were some of our first conservationists. These relationships 
are preserved and passed on with pride, along with a deep and abiding 
respect for nature.

[[Page 121]]

Today, we continue the essential work of conserving and sustaining our 
precious environment. Our landscapes are not only a source of pleasure, 
but a valuable resource for our local economies and the livelihood of 
many across America. Last year, after an unprecedented public engagement 
effort, with input from across our country, my Administration launched 
the America's Great Outdoors Initiative. Through this initiative, we are 
working to meet the unique challenges of environmental stewardship in 
the 21st century and create community-based solutions for conservation.
As part of the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, we recently 
established the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation to 
assist with promoting outdoor recreational activities for American 
families on public lands. By coordinating with State, local, and tribal 
governments, and other stakeholders, the Council aims to connect our 
families, and especially our youth, to the rugged beauty of the natural 
wonders our Nation's hunters and anglers know so well.
Protecting the conservation legacy of our past is the responsibility of 
all Americans. Working together, we can preserve the wonder of nature 
while building a future where all Americans are able to enjoy and share 
in her bounty.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24, 2011, as 
National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8721 of September 23, 2011

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation is guided by the simple promise that no matter our origins, 
we can provide a better life for our children. We have long believed in 
a fair America, where, with hard work and determination, anyone can 
succeed. Our story has been written by generations who have put their 
shoulders to the wheel of history to move our country forward.
Today, this legacy continues. Our strength comes from individuals from 
all walks of life, and of every race and creed. Minority-owned 
businesses are engines of job creation and backbones of communities 
across America--from Main Street to Wall Street, and from country 
markets to Silicon Valley. They are on the cutting edge of development, 
and are strong competitors at home and abroad. Small businesses, 
including minority-owned enterprises, are where most new jobs begin. To 
recover from this economic

[[Page 122]]

crisis and improve our competitiveness, we must help these job creators 
hire, grow, and revitalize our economy.
My Administration is working to make this growth a reality. Our Start-up 
America initiative connects established private sector mentors to 
entrepreneurs, helping accelerate innovation through coordination. Last 
year, I signed the Small Business Jobs Act, providing billions of 
dollars in lending support and tax cuts for small businesses. The 
Federal Government is also the Nation's largest purchaser of goods and 
services, and every Federal agency is taking aggressive steps to improve 
contracting with small businesses, including minority-owned firms.
Even in challenging times, American entrepreneurs consistently respond 
to adversity with brighter ideas, more ambitious innovations, and 
smarter technology than the world has ever seen. These businesses create 
jobs and support our communities. As a Nation, we must continue to 
remove barriers to these opportunities, and ensure they remain open to 
all Americans.
The task of making America more competitive is a job for everyone. To 
build an economy that lasts, we must all work to create the well-paying 
jobs that will sustain us. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, 
we honor minority enterprises as vital to our economic success, and 
recommit to ensuring minority business owners have the information, 
tools, and resources they need to help America win the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 25, 2011, 
through October 1, 2011, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call 
upon all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of our 
Nation's diverse enterprises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's earliest days, the men and women of our Armed Forces 
have demonstrated the courage and heroism that have come to define 
America. Across shores, in deserts, and on city streets around the 
world, extraordinary Americans have given their last full measure of 
devotion defending the freedoms we cherish. Their ultimate sacrifice is 
one we can never fully repay, and the enormity of the grief their 
families carry we can never fully know.

[[Page 123]]

Gold Star mothers and families know the immeasurable cost of fighting 
for the ideals we believe in, and they know the pride that comes with 
exemplary service to America. On this day, and every day, we offer them 
our deep gratitude and respect, and we are inspired by their strength 
and determination. Through heartbreaking loss, our Gold Star families 
continue to support one another, serve their communities, and bring 
comfort to the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families.
Our fallen heroes answered their country's call to duty, sacrificing all 
they had and all they would ever know. Their families exemplify that 
same mark of selflessness and patriotism that has sustained our country 
and will sustain us through trials to come. We honor their sacrifice, 
and stand with our service members, military families, and Gold Star 
families as they have stood for us. Today, we reaffirm our promise to 
care for those left behind, to uphold the ideals for which the fallen 
gave their lives, and to carry with us their legacy as we work toward a 
better future.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1985 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold 
Star Mother's Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 25, 2011, as 
Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day. I call upon all Government 
officials to display the flag of the United States over Government 
buildings on this special day. I also encourage the American people to 
display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public expression 
of our Nation's sympathy and respect for our Gold Star Mothers and 
Families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8723 of October 3, 2011

National Arts and Humanities Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Norman Rockwell's magazine covers are classic and recognizable 
portrayals of American life. A longtime advocate of tolerance, Rockwell 
was criticized by some for a painting now hanging steps from the Oval 
Office--The Problem We All Live With. Inspired by the story of Ruby 
Bridges, this painting depicts a young girl being escorted to her newly-
integrated school by United States Marshals. Today, the portrait remains 
a symbol of our Nation's struggle for racial equality.
Like Rockwell's painting, art in all its forms often challenges us to 
consider new perspectives and to rethink how we see the world. This 
image still

[[Page 124]]

moves us with its simple poignancy, capturing a moment in American 
history that changed us forever. This is the power of the arts and 
humanities--they speak to our condition and affirm our desire for 
something more and something better. Great works of literature, theater, 
dance, fine art, and music reach us through a universal language that 
unites us regardless of background, gender, race, or creed.
Millions of Americans earn a living in the arts and humanities, and the 
non-profit and for-profit arts industries are important parts of both 
our cultural heritage and our economy. The First Lady and I have been 
proud to honor this work by displaying American art at the White House 
and by hosting music, dance, poetry, and film performances and 
screenings. The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, 
along with the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment 
for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services 
continues to recognize the skill and creativity of American artists, 
historians, and philosophers while helping educate and inspire our 
children through the power of the arts and humanities.
We must recognize the contributions of the arts and humanities not only 
by supporting the artists of today, but also by giving opportunities to 
the creative thinkers of tomorrow. Educators across our country are 
opening young minds, fostering innovation, and developing imaginations 
through arts education. Through their work, they are empowering our 
Nation's students with the ability to meet the challenges of a global 
marketplace. It is a well-rounded education for our children that will 
fuel our efforts to lead in a new economy where critical and creative 
thinking will be the keys to success.
Today, the arts and humanities continue to break social and political 
barriers. Throughout our history, American hopes and aspirations have 
been captured in the arts, from the songs of enslaved Americans yearning 
for freedom to the films that grace our screens today. This month, we 
celebrate the enlightenment and insight we have gained from the arts and 
humanities, and we recommit to supporting expression that challenges our 
assumptions, sparks our curiosity, and continues to drive us toward a 
more perfect union.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2011 as 
National Arts and Humanities Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to join together in observing this month with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs to celebrate the arts and the 
humanities in America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8724 of October 3, 2011

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This month, pink ribbons will be displayed around our country, adorning 
jackets and public spaces alike. A sign of solidarity, these ribbons 
remind us of our commitment to preventing and treating breast cancer, 
and to supporting those courageously battling this disease. Countless 
Americans will participate in events to raise awareness alongside 
survivors and their families, working together to support research that 
will save lives.
We have come far in recent decades in the prevention, early detection, 
and treatment of breast cancer. Still, this year, hundreds of thousands 
of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and too many will be 
lost. African-American women bear a particularly large burden, 
experiencing higher death rates from breast cancer than other racial or 
ethnic groups in the United States. Too many men also develop and fall 
victim to this cancer.
It is important to understand the risks and precautions associated with 
breast cancer. Some risk factors, like obesity, are avoidable. Other 
factors, like family history, are not avoidable, but knowledge of them 
can help inform medical decisions. Taking protective steps like getting 
regular check-ups, maintaining a healthy body weight and balanced diet, 
and exercising may help lower the chances of developing breast cancer. I 
encourage all Americans to talk to their doctors about breast cancer, 
and to visit www.Cancer.gov to learn more about symptoms, diagnosis, and 
treatment.
Screening and early detection are essential to fighting this disease, 
yet only about two-thirds of American women over 40 have had a mammogram 
in the last 2 years. But now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, all 
Americans joining new health-care plans can receive recommended 
preventive services, including annual mammograms for women over 40, with 
no out-of-pocket costs. This new benefit would also ensure that women in 
new insurance plans who are at high risk for breast cancer are covered 
when they speak with their clinicians about ways to prevent or delay the 
development of cancer. The Affordable Care Act also established a 
committee tasked with advancing awareness and prevention of breast 
cancer among young women.
This month, we join together in honoring the women and men lost to 
breast cancer. In their memory, we recommit to supporting the hard-
working researchers, health-care providers, advocates, and organizations 
dedicated to treating and curing this devastating disease. We embrace 
our mothers, daughters, sisters, and loved ones currently battling 
breast cancer, along with their friends and families, and we resolve to 
one day defeat it.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2011 as 
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government 
agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and all other 
interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of 
what Americans can do to prevent and control breast cancer.

Proclamation 8725 of October 3, 2011

National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans, along with people around the world, depend on the Internet 
and digital tools for all aspects of our lives--from mobile devices to 
online commerce and social networking. This fundamental reliance is why 
our digital infrastructure is a strategic national asset, and why its 
security is our shared responsibility. This month, we recognize the role 
we all play in ensuring our information and communications 
infrastructure is interoperable, secure, reliable, and open to all.
Early in my Administration, we began updating our Nation's cybersecurity 
programs and policies. We developed a comprehensive plan that ensures a 
coordinated national response to major disruptive cyber events. This 
May, we also proposed to the Congress a plan to strengthen protection of 
our power grids, water systems, and other critical infrastructure. And 
because we have seen the benefits and risks of cyber- and information-
related technologies play out across the world, this year we laid out 
the first comprehensive international vision for the future of the 
Internet. It sets an agenda for partnering with other nations and better 
defines how we can ensure the secure, free flow of information and 
promote universal rights, privacy, and prosperity.
Every American has a stake in securing our networks and personal 
information, and we are working across the public and private sectors to 
ensure coordinated and planned responses to cyber incidents, as we do 
with natural disasters. The vast majority of our critical information 
infrastructure is owned and operated by businesses and enterprises 
across America. To help protect them, my Administration is collaborating 
with the private sector on best security practices, while continuing to 
provide the resources necessary for innovation--including expanded 
broadband access and smarter electric grids.
Cybersecurity is a necessity for both businesses and consumers, and that 
is why we released the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in 
Cyberspace. This plan improves security for consumers conducting e-
commerce by helping prevent fraud and identity theft and by making it 
easier for businesses to operate online. We are also working with 
community-based organizations and public- and private-sector partners to 
empower digital citizens to make safe choices online through our ``Stop. 
Think. Connect.'' campaign.
The same American ingenuity that put a man on the moon also created the 
Internet, launching an information revolution. We must now harness that

[[Page 127]]

spirit of innovation to develop the next generation of accessible, 
secure technologies to build a safer, more prosperous future for all 
Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2011 as 
National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and to 
observe this month with activities, events, and trainings that will 
enhance our national security and resilience.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8726 of October 3, 2011

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Utilizing the talents of all Americans is essential for our Nation to 
out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world. During 
National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we recognize the skills 
that people with disabilities bring to our workforce, and we rededicate 
ourselves to improving employment opportunities in both the public and 
private sectors for those living with disabilities.
 More than 20 years after the signing of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, individuals with disabilities, including injured veterans, are 
making immeasurable contributions to workplaces across our country. 
Unfortunately, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities 
remains too high--nearly double the rate of people without 
disabilities--and reversing this trend is crucial.
 In both the public and private sectors, we can increase employment 
opportunities for Americans with disabilities. My Administration is 
promoting competitive, integrated employment for persons with 
disabilities and the elderly through the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services. Last year, we also recommitted to making the Federal 
Government a model employer for people living with disabilities. 
Agencies are working harder than ever to promote equal hiring practices 
and increase retention, while also expanding internships, fellowships, 
and training opportunities.
 We know education is the foundation on which all children can build 
bright and successful futures, and no child should be limited in his or 
her desire to learn. In September, we announced the final regulations 
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Part C, to 
improve services and outcomes for infants and toddlers with disabilities 
and their families during the critical years before kindergarten. The 
educational environments we

[[Page 128]]

are creating for children with disabilities will ensure they are better 
prepared to succeed in the classroom and later in the workplace, helping 
position our Nation to lead in the 21st century.
Work accessibility is just as vital to success as ensuring educational 
and hiring opportunities. Public transportation is a service that should 
be available to all Americans, and rules instated this year by the 
Department of Transportation require new rail construction or 
renovations to ensure accessibility to persons with disabilities. We are 
also improving our compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act 
to make Federal agencies' electronic and information technology more 
accessible to individuals with disabilities. This will ensure all 
applicants have equal opportunity to apply for jobs, and it will allow 
Federal employees to better use technology at work.
 To win the future, we must harness the power of our Nation's richest 
resource--our people. Americans with disabilities, like all Americans, 
are entitled to not only full participation in our society, but also 
full opportunity in our society. Their talents and contributions are 
vital to the strength of our Nation's workforce and our future 
prosperity. Together, we can ensure persons living with disabilities 
have equal access to employment, and to inclusive, supportive 
workplaces.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2011 as 
National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to 
embrace the talents and skills that individuals with disabilities bring 
to our workplaces and communities and to promote the right to equal 
employment opportunity for all people.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8727 of October 3, 2011

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 During Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we recognize the significant 
achievements we have made in reducing domestic violence in America, and 
we recommit ourselves to the important work still before us. Despite 
tremendous progress, an average of three women in America die as a 
result of domestic violence each day. One in four women and one in 
thirteen men will experience domestic violence in their lifetime. These 
statistics are even more sobering when we consider that domestic 
violence often goes unreported.
 The ramifications of domestic violence are staggering. Young women are 
among the most vulnerable, suffering the highest rates of intimate 
partner

[[Page 129]]

violence. Exposure to domestic violence puts our young men and women in 
danger of long-term physical, psychological, and emotional harm. 
Children who experience domestic violence are at a higher risk for 
failure in school, emotional disorders, and substance abuse, and are 
more likely to perpetuate the cycle of violence themselves later in 
life.
 My Administration is working not only to curb domestic violence, but to 
bring it to an end. Last year, we announced an unprecedented coordinated 
strategy across Federal agencies to prevent and stop violence against 
women. We are empowering survivors to break the cycle of abuse with 
programs to help them become financially independent. We have prevented 
victims of domestic violence from being evicted or denied assisted 
housing after abuse. And we are promoting tools for better enforcement 
of protective orders, while helping survivors gain access to legal 
representation.
 In addition, as part of the Affordable Care Act, the Department of 
Health and Human Services announced historic new guidelines that will 
ensure women receive preventive health services without additional cost, 
including domestic violence screening and counseling. The Affordable 
Care Act also ensures that insurance companies can no longer classify 
domestic violence as a pre-existing condition.
 Last December, I reauthorized the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment 
Act, giving communities life-saving tools to help identify and treat 
child abuse or neglect. It also supports shelters, service programs, and 
the National Domestic Violence Hotline, linking tens of thousands of 
victims every month to the resources needed to reach safety. I encourage 
victims, their loved ones, and concerned citizens to use this hotline 
for more information at 1-800-799-SAFE or visit www.TheHotline.org.
 This is not just a job for government; it is a job for all of us. Vice 
President Joe Biden's ``1is2many'' initiative reminds us that everyone 
has a part to play in ending violence against youth. By engaging men and 
women, mothers and fathers, and schools and universities in the fight, 
we can teach our children about healthy relationships. We are asking 
everyone to play an active role in preventing and ending domestic 
violence, by stepping up to stop violence when they see it. During 
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we recommit to making sure 
that no one suffers alone, and to assisting those who need help in 
reaching a safer tomorrow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2011 as 
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to 
speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist 
victims of these crimes in finding the help and healing they need.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8728 of October 3, 2011

National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

By providing strong support systems for our loved ones, and by talking 
with our children about the dangers of alcohol and other drugs, we can 
increase their chances of living long, healthy, and productive lives. 
During National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, we celebrate those 
dedicated to prevention efforts, and we renew our commitment to the 
well-being of all Americans.
The damage done by drugs is felt far beyond the millions of Americans 
with diagnosable substance abuse or dependence problems--countless 
families and communities also live with the pain and heartbreak it 
causes. Relationships are destroyed, crime and violence blight 
communities, and dreams are shattered. Substance abuse touches every 
sector of our society, straining our health care and criminal justice 
systems.
For all these reasons, my Administration has made prevention a central 
component of our National Drug Control Strategy, and we have developed 
the first-ever National Prevention Strategy. These strategies, inspired 
by the thousands of drug-free coalitions across our country, recognize 
the power of community-based prevention organizations, and suggest that 
prevention activities are most effective when informed by science, 
driven by State and local partnerships, and tuned to the specific needs 
of a community.
By investing in evidence-based prevention, we can also decrease 
emergency room visits and lower rates of chronic disease, easing the 
burden on America's health care system. We can improve student 
achievement and workforce readiness. Most importantly, we must continue 
to support the efforts of parents and guardians, our children's first 
teachers and role models, whose positive influence is the most effective 
deterrent to alcohol and other drug use and the strongest influence for 
making health choices.
Through national collaboration, community programs, and the help of 
engaged youth, parents, guardians, educators, law enforcement officers, 
clergy, and others, we can build a stronger, healthier America. This 
month and throughout the year, let us teach our Nation's young people to 
tackle life's challenges with resilience, hope, and determination.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2011 as 
National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to 
engage in appropriate programs and activities to promote comprehensive 
substance abuse prevention efforts within their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8729 of October 3, 2011

Child Health Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One of the greatest responsibilities we have as a Nation is to ensure 
the health and well-being of our children. Today, we rededicate 
ourselves to providing our children with the quality health care, 
healthy food, clean environments, and safe schools and communities they 
deserve.
We have taken important steps that speak to who we are as a Nation that 
cares for its families and children. Young adults are the least likely 
to have health insurance, but now, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 
young adults can stay on their parents' insurance plan until they turn 
26. As a result, approximately one million more have insurance coverage 
than 1 year ago. In addition, it is now illegal for health insurance 
companies to limit or deny coverage to children based on pre-existing 
conditions.
Getting children off to a healthy start at home and at school is vital 
to their success. This year, through the First Lady's Let's Move! 
Initiative, Americans have shown their overwhelming commitment to 
children's health--over 1,250 schools met our HealthierUS School 
Challenge, thousands of child care providers are adopting healthier 
practices, and 1.7 million Americans achieved the Presidential Active 
Lifestyle Award. I also signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, making 
significant improvements to our school lunches, and we released a 
redesigned food pyramid--MyPlate--to encourage better eating.
Making sure kids grow up in safe environments is just as important to 
ensuring their well-being. In March, we hosted the White House 
Conference on Bullying Prevention because no child should feel unsafe or 
be afraid to be who they are at school or in their community. To keep 
children safe from hazards, we have taken great strides to provide for 
cleaner air and drinking water, and to reduce children's exposure to 
lead dust. To make school buildings safer, the American Jobs Act I have 
proposed would provide for investments that would put Americans back to 
work while making important repairs to schools, like removing asbestos 
and updating technology.
On Child Health Day, we recognize the fundamental importance of caring 
for the health of our next generation, and we recommit to helping our 
children, their families, and our communities fulfill the dream of 
healthy, happy, and secure futures.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in 
October as Child Health Day and has requested the President to issue a 
proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 3, 2011, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon families, child health professionals, faith-based and 
community organizations, and all levels of government to help ensure 
that America's children stay safe and healthy.

Proclamation 8730 of October 6, 2011

National Energy Action Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, America's energy resources have laid the 
foundation for our Nation's economic security and prosperity, powering 
our factories, lighting our classrooms, and warming our homes. Today, we 
stand at a critical juncture. As global demand for energy grows, the 
United States must take bold action to create a more secure energy 
future and build a competitive 21st-century clean energy economy.
Over the past two and a half years, my Administration has taken 
unprecedented action to ensure America leads in the development and 
deployment of clean energy. To that end, we have made the largest 
investments in clean energy in our Nation's history, which are giving 
rise to cutting-edge technologies, creating new American jobs and 
industries, and putting us on track to doubling renewable energy 
capacity in the United States by the end of next year. At the same time, 
we have expanded safe and responsible development of our domestic energy 
resources.
To help save consumers money at the pump and on their energy bills, my 
Administration has set historic new fuel economy standards for cars and 
trucks and taken steps to increase the efficiency of our homes and 
buildings. We have established common-sense and cost-effective standards 
to reduce harmful pollution, protecting our environment and the public 
health. And we are leading by example, requiring the Federal Government 
to increase energy efficiency, reduce waste, and use its scale and 
resources to advance a clean energy economy.
Taken together, these steps are helping unlock American innovation, 
create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and increase our Nation's 
competitiveness in the global economy. But these steps must mark the 
beginning of our efforts, not the end. Today, the stakes are high and 
the global competition to lead in clean energy is more intense than ever 
before. The United States cannot afford to fall behind on what will be 
one of the keys to our success in the future.
Across our Nation, millions of Americans are already doing their part. 
Farmers are pushing the envelope to develop advanced and renewable 
fuels, young people are taking action to make their schools and 
communities more sustainable, and our best scientists, engineers, and 
entrepreneurs are working together to move new ideas and technologies 
from the lab to the marketplace. If America can do what it does best--
tap into the talents, skills, and creativity of our people to meet the 
challenges of our

[[Page 133]]

time--we will not just lead the clean energy economy, we will lead the 
21st-century global economy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2011 as 
National Energy Action Month. I call upon the citizens of the United 
States to recognize this month by making cleaner energy choices that 
will help build a stronger Nation, a more robust economy, and a 
healthier environment for our children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the

Proclamation 8731 of October 6, 2011

German-American Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation of immigrants, America has been shaped and strengthened by 
the millions who have come to our shores seeking a better future. German 
men and women were among the first to have made the perilous journey 
across the Atlantic to seize the promise of the American dream. The same 
spirit that guided intrepid settlers to help establish Jamestown, 
Virginia, and found Germantown, Pennsylvania, is reflected in the 
indelible contributions to our common culture that we celebrate today.
Today, nearly one quarter of all Americans trace their ancestry to 
Germany, and many familiar American traditions--from Christmas trees to 
kindergarten--have German origins. German descendants have fundamentally 
and positively shaped the course of American history. From the wheels of 
labor and the fields of sport, to the halls of power and throughout our 
society, generations of German Americans have helped make America what 
it is today.
The bonds of friendship and trust between the United States and Germany 
continue to enrich both our nations. Our partnership is more important 
than ever, and it remains indispensable to global security and 
prosperity. As we observe German-American Day, we celebrate how far we 
have come together and remember the lasting legacy that past pioneers 
have bestowed onto us.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2011, as 
German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the 
history of German Americans and to commemorate the many contributions 
they have made to our Nation.

Proclamation 8732 of October 7, 2011

Fire Prevention Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Fires, whether caused by people or nature, can have devastating effects. 
Hundreds of thousands of fires happen in and around American homes every 
year, killing or injuring thousands of people and causing untold damage 
to families and communities. This week, we honor the selfless first 
responders who put themselves on the line to safeguard us all from fire, 
and we reaffirm the need for Americans to practice fire safety 
throughout the year.
This year's Fire Prevention Week theme, ``Protect Your Family from 
Fire,'' encourages all Americans to promote fire prevention awareness 
both inside and outside the home. Everyone can take significant steps to 
mitigate the risk of fire, from installing and maintaining smoke alarms 
on every level of their home to practicing safe cooking behaviors. 
Families can help protect themselves by designing and practicing an 
escape plan that includes an outside meeting place with multiple exit 
paths out of each room. And, with the help of local safety officials, 
families can work together to protect their neighborhood with a 
Community Wildfire Protection Plan.
In 2011, Federal firefighting grants have been provided to 16 States to 
assist with wildfires that have caused destruction to families, farms, 
and businesses. Those living with the threat of wildfire can safeguard 
their houses by mowing dry grasses to two inches or less, and by 
clearing brush, leaves, green grass, and lumber from around their homes. 
By taking precautionary steps, and by discussing and practicing 
evacuation plans with our families, we can empower ourselves and our 
communities with the tools to prevent fires, and to save lives, 
property, and livestock when fires do occur.
This week, our Nation honors the dedicated firefighters and other first 
responders who do the hard, dangerous work of keeping our communities 
safe from fire. Many have laid down their lives to save our friends and 
neighbors, and their selfless sacrifice defines the nature of courage. 
As we pay tribute to their memories, let us resolve to maintain our 
vigilance and take proactive steps to stop fire emergencies before they 
begin.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 9 through 
October 15, 2011, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 16, 2011, 
in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will 
be flown at half-staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the 
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans 
to participate

[[Page 135]]

in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by 
renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8733 of October 7, 2011

National School Lunch Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Children are America's greatest treasure, and ensuring their health is 
one of our most important duties as parents, families, and community 
members. Our children's continued ability to learn in the classroom, 
grow up healthy, and reach their full potential will depend on what we 
do now to secure their future. The National School Lunch Program has 
been a central part of our Nation's commitment to healthy children since 
its inception in 1946, improving the nutrition of generations of 
children with affordable, nutritious meals at school. It now serves tens 
of millions of children every day.
Despite our successes, too many American children go without proper 
nutrition. One-third of children in our country are overweight or obese, 
and without a major change, one-third of children born in the year 2000 
will develop Type 2 diabetes during their lifetime. Schools are central 
to improving child health, as children who eat both school breakfast and 
lunch may consume more than half their daily calories at school.
The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 has brought historic reform to 
school meal programs. The law takes new steps to address childhood 
obesity by setting nutritional standards for foods sold in schools, 
updating requirements for school wellness policies, and providing more 
nutritional information to parents. It also works to eliminate hunger 
during the school day by increasing the number of eligible children 
enrolled in school meal programs and removing barriers to school meals 
for children most in need.
First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative has worked with 
schools nationwide to create healthy opportunities for children. This 
year, we exceeded our goal of doubling the number of schools that meet 
the HealthierUS School Challenge. We have also engaged child care 
providers in adopting healthier practices, and this year 1.7 million 
Americans achieved the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award.
To advance our goals even further, Let's Move! has collaborated with 
individuals and organizations across our Nation to bring over 800 salad 
bars to schools, providing thousands of children with greater access to 
fruits and vegetables. School nutrition professionals, chefs, students, 
parents, and communities have also used their talents to develop 
nutritious foods for schools through the Recipes for Healthy Kids 
competition and the Chefs Move to Schools initiative.

[[Page 136]]

Good nutrition at school is an investment in our children's futures. 
During National School Lunch Week, we thank the food program 
administrators, educators, parents, and communities who provide for our 
Nation's sons and daughters, and we recommit to ensuring all our 
children have the healthy food they need to grow and succeed.
The Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-
780), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday 
in October each year as ``National School Lunch Week,'' and has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 9 through October 15, 
2011, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join 
the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch 
Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being 
of our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8734 of October 7, 2011

Leif Erikson Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The first Europeans known to set foot on North America took to the ocean 
more than a millennium ago, facing fierce waters and an uncertain 
course. Led by Leif Erikson--son of Iceland and grandson of Norway--
these intrepid Scandinavians sailed fearlessly into the unknown, driven 
by the promise of adventure and dreams of new discoveries. When they 
landed in modern day Canada, they founded the settlement of Vinland and 
established a legacy of exploration and exchange that is fundamental to 
our courageous spirit.
Evoking the bravery and determination that characterized Erikson and his 
crew of pioneers, a group of Norwegians completed their own journey on 
October 9, 1825. Crammed into an undersized sloop named Restauration, 
these brave travelers sought new opportunities and embraced the same 
commitment to exploration that had driven their predecessors centuries 
earlier. On Leif Erikson Day, we commemorate these historic voyages and 
celebrate the many ways Nordic-American culture has enriched our Nation.
The triumphs of Erikson and those who followed inspire us to continue 
reaching for new horizons. Whether developing new technologies, pushing 
the boundaries of medicine, or driving ever further into the vastness of 
space, we do so confidently, knowing that icons like Leif Erikson were 
able to overcome incredible odds and drive the world forward. Today, let 
us celebrate his life and legacy with the bold pursuit of America's next 
great innovation.

[[Page 137]]

To honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the 
Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 
2, 1964, has authorized the President to proclaim October 9 of each year 
as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2011, as Leif Erikson Day. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8735 of October 7, 2011

Columbus Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On October 12, 1492, Christopher Columbus and his crewmembers sighted 
land after an ambitious voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. The ideals 
that guided them to this land--courage, determination, and a thirst for 
discovery--have inspired countless Americans and led to some of our 
Nation's proudest accomplishments. Today, we renew our commitment to 
fostering the same spirit of innovation and exploration that will help 
future generations reach new horizons.
Ten weeks before his arrival in the Americas, Columbus and his 
crewmembers set sail from Spain in search of a westward route to Asia. 
Though their journey was daring, it did not yield the trade route they 
sought. Instead, it illuminated a continent then unknown to Europe, and 
established an unbreakable bond between two distant lands.
These explorers, and countless others that followed them, encountered 
indigenous peoples that had lived in the Western hemisphere for tens of 
thousands of years. On this day, we also remember the tragic hardships 
these communities endured. We honor their countless and ongoing 
contributions to our Nation, and we recommit to strengthening the tribal 
communities that continue to enrich the fabric of American life.
Columbus returned to the Americas three more times after his first 
historic voyage, and his journey has been followed by millions of 
immigrants, including our Nation's earliest settlers and Founders. Born 
in Genoa, Italy, Christopher Columbus was the first in a proud tradition 
of Italians to cross the Atlantic to our shores. Today, we recognize 
their indelible influence on our country and celebrate the remarkable 
ways Italian-Americans have shaped the American experience.
The excitement Christopher Columbus and his crewmembers experienced that 
October morning is felt every day by today's pioneers: entrepreneurs

[[Page 138]]

and inventors, researchers and engineers. On the anniversary of 
Christopher Columbus's voyage, we celebrate the pursuit of discovery as 
an essential element of the American character. Embracing this heritage 
and inspiring young people to set their own sails, our Nation will reach 
the shores of an ever brighter tomorrow.
In commemoration of Christopher Columbus's historic voyage 519 years 
ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified 
in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President 
proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 10, 2011, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of our diverse history and all who have contributed to 
shaping this Nation.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8736 of October 11, 2011

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, America pays tribute to Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski, a 
proud Polish patriot who embraced our country's highest ideals. He 
fought for freedom on two continents, earned the title, ``Father of the 
American Cavalry,'' and guided his unit through some of the toughest 
tests of the Revolutionary War, ultimately laying down his life for our 
nascent country. On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we honor his memory 
and celebrate the many contributions Polish Americans have made to 
America's culture and history.
As a young soldier, General Pulaski rose to defend his homeland against 
foreign occupation. He fought valiantly for Poland's sovereignty but was 
eventually forced into exile, and it was in Paris that he met Benjamin 
Franklin. Franklin told him of America's aspirations, and Pulaski 
journeyed across the Atlantic to join our struggle for freedom, 
equality, and justice. Arriving in America in 1777, he served beside 
General George Washington, who appreciated his military experience. He 
later formed an independent corps of cavalry known as the Pulaski 
Legion, which battled bravely from the New Jersey coast to the siege of 
Savannah, where he was mortally wounded.
Pulaski's unit was a diverse collection of soldiers, composed of 
Americans, Germans, Frenchmen, Irishmen, and Poles. Their differences 
were many,

[[Page 139]]

but they were united by a basic longing for human liberty. This same 
longing--which moved Pulaski to make the ultimate sacrifice--has come to 
define America and reflect our lasting ties to the people of Poland. 
Today, as we commemorate Casimir Pulaski's extraordinary life, we 
recognize that his spirit lives on in all those who are driven to pursue 
a freer, more just world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2011, as 
General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to commemorate 
this occasion with appropriate programs and activities paying tribute to 
Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who defend the freedom of our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8737 of October 14, 2011

National Character Counts Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In times of adversity and triumph alike, the American people have been 
guided by the strength of our character. With resilience and compassion, 
we have provided for our neighbors, lifted their spirits, and embraced 
our shared humanity. During National Character Counts Week, we celebrate 
our country's core values and commit to passing them on to the next 
generation.
By setting a positive example for our children, we can inspire in them 
the virtues that define our Nation: personal integrity, bold ingenuity, 
and a drive to serve others. America's role models--from parents and 
teachers to community leaders and coaches--play an integral role in 
shaping character. They foster patriotism, promote civic pride, and 
teach young people to live by the Golden Rule by treating others the way 
they want to be treated. Together, all Americans must cultivate moral 
fortitude, preach tolerance, and demonstrate the value of respect for 
those different from ourselves.
Tragic events in our Nation remind us why it is imperative that we 
create a climate of acceptance and compassion in our schools and 
communities. Our country has mourned as we have heard heartbreaking 
stories of promising young men and women subjected to harassment and 
bullying, driving some out of school, and others to ultimately take 
their own lives. No family should have to endure such a loss, and no 
child should feel that alone. Let us honor their memories by striving to 
make our neighborhoods and schools safe and affirming places for every 
child to learn, grow, and dream.
Our Nation's character is engrained in our past, central to our present, 
and key to our future. All of us share a responsibility to preserve and 
uphold the values that have kept our country strong, prosperous, and 
free. This

[[Page 140]]

week, we resolve to stay true to the American spirit and live according 
to our highest ideals.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 16 through 
October 22, 2011, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public 
officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8738 of October 14, 2011

National Forest Products Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's forests have long played an integral role in shaping and 
developing our Nation. They help us access clean water and air, drive 
discovery as natural laboratories, and make our communities more 
beautiful and vibrant places to live. From renewable energy and biofuels 
to green building materials, forests also provide a wide variety of 
products that make up an important part of our economy. During National 
Forest Products Week, we celebrate the value of our woodlands and 
recommit to careful stewardship and preservation of these national 
treasures.
Through the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, my Administration 
continues to advance a 21st century conservation agenda and ensure we 
use our precious natural resources sustainably. Meeting the test of 
environmental stewardship often means finding the best ideas at the 
grassroots level, and this initiative is guided by the insights of 
Americans from across our country. From hunters and fishers to tribal 
leaders and young people, we all have a stake in safeguarding the 
woodlands we cherish. As we build the foundation for a smarter, more 
community-driven environmental strategy, we embrace the uniquely 
American idea that each of us has an equal share in the land around us 
and an equal responsibility to protect it.
This year, we also join the global community in commemorating the 
International Year of Forests. By bolstering our commitment to the 
responsible management and conservation of forests around the world, we 
sow the seeds of a greener future for our children and grandchildren.
To recognize the importance of products from our forests, the Congress, 
by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the 
week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as ``National 
Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in observance of this week.

[[Page 141]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 16 through October 22, 2011, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call on the people of the United States 
to join me in recognizing the dedicated individuals who are responsible 
for the stewardship of our forests and for the preservation, management, 
and use of these precious natural resources for the benefit of the 
American people.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8739 of October 14, 2011

Blind Americans Equality Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Generations of blind and visually impaired Americans have dedicated 
their passion and skills to enhancing our national life--leading as 
public servants, penning works of literature, lending their voice to 
music, and inspiring as champions of sport. On Blind Americans Equality 
Day, we celebrate the achievements of blind and visually impaired 
Americans and reaffirm our commitment to advancing their complete social 
and economic integration.
My Administration is dedicated to ensuring Americans with disabilities 
have every opportunity to reach their full potential. Last year, I 
signed the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility 
Act to set new standards that enable people living with disabilities to 
access broadband, digital, and mobile innovations. To help level the 
playing field for employment, we are working to improve the Federal 
Government's compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. 
Making electronic and information technology 508 compliant will give 
applicants with disabilities a fair chance and allow employees with 
disabilities to use necessary tools while on the job. By taking these 
steps, my Administration reaffirms its pledge to openness by making sure 
that people with disabilities can better access all the information the 
Federal Government has placed online.
This year also marks the 75th anniversary of the passage of the 
Randolph-Sheppard Act. For decades, the legislation has provided 
openings for blind Americans to work as vendors on Federal property, 
creating meaningful entrepreneurial opportunities and enabling them to 
contribute to our economy. These jobs have enriched the lives of those 
participating in the Randolph-Sheppard program and enhanced public 
understanding of blindness for those who have interacted with the 
program's vendors.
Though we have made progress in the march to equality for the blind and 
those with low vision, there is still more work to be done. In addition 
to

[[Page 142]]

improving access to technology and employment opportunities, this 
January, I signed the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act. This landmark 
legislation requires electric and hybrid car manufacturers to add sounds 
to alert all pedestrians to the presence of these unusually quiet 
vehicles. These provisions will help increase the safety and 
independence of blind and visually impaired Americans.
By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628, as 
amended), the Congress designated October 15 of each year as ``White 
Cane Safety Day'' to recognize the contributions of Americans who are 
blind or have low vision. Today, let us recommit to forging ahead with 
the work of perfecting our Union and ensuring we remain a Nation where 
all our people, including those living with disabilities, have every 
opportunity to achieve their dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2011, as Blind Americans 
Equality Day. I call upon public officials, business and community 
leaders, educators, librarians, and Americans across the country to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8740 of October 24, 2011

United Nations Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 1945, 51 nations in a world shaken by war signed the Charter of the 
United Nations. Determined to move beyond an era of violence and 
uncertainty, these pioneers aimed to prevent conflict by addressing its 
causes. Today, the United Nations provides a forum to seek lasting peace 
by mediating international disputes, advancing human rights, and 
fostering global cooperation. On United Nations Day, we join our 192 
fellow member states in celebrating the founding ideals of the Charter, 
and we recommit to the global pursuit of peace, justice, and human 
dignity.
Built out of the ashes of war and genocide, the United Nations emerged 
as a vehicle for human progress. Recognizing the power and virtue of 
working in concert, the founders of this institution set out to mend the 
wounds caused by World War II, embrace peace over chaos, and lay the 
foundation for global cooperation on shared goals. Now, as the fates of 
nations become ever more intertwined, the leadership, staff, and member 
states of the United Nations continue to play an essential role in 
addressing global issues--from public health and economic development to 
climate change, transnational terrorism, and nuclear proliferation.
Extraordinary events have reminded the world that the collective action 
of ordinary citizens can lead the march toward liberty and justice. At a 
time

[[Page 143]]

of dramatic political transformation, the United Nations can embrace 
democratic movements and stand beside those who reject tyranny and 
oppression and look to the promise of freedom and prosperity. Together, 
we will help realize the aspirations of peoples long denied the 
opportunity to achieve their dreams.
The men and women who created the United Nations understood that peace 
is not simply the absence of war. The global community must continue not 
only to promote stability, but also defend the right of all peoples to 
live free and the right of all nations to chart their own course. The 
United States, working in and with the United Nations, will never accept 
a flawed status quo, but will pursue with vigor the world as we know it 
can be.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2011, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, and the 
officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to 
observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8741 of October 25, 2011

To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) 
(AGOA), authorizes the President to designate a country listed in 
section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets the 
eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 
3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an ``eligible sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.
3. Section 112(c) of the AGOA, as added in section 6002 of the Africa 
Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (Division D, title VI of Public Law 
109-432) (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)), provides special rules for certain apparel 
articles imported from ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries.''

[[Page 144]]

4. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 
1974 Act, I have determined that the Republic of C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire 
(C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire), the Republic of Guinea (Guinea), and the Republic 
of Niger (Niger) meet the eligibility requirements set forth or 
referenced therein, and I have decided to designate C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, 
Guinea, and Niger as eligible sub-Saharan African countries and as 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.
5. C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Niger each satisfy the criterion for 
treatment as a ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country'' under section 112(c) of the AGOA.
6. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes 
the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other 
acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), and title V and section 604 of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461-67, 2483), do hereby proclaim that:
    (1) C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Niger are designated as 
eligible sub-Saharan African countries and as beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries.
    (2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 
16(a) to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in 
the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries ``Republic of 
C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire'', ``Republic of Guinea'', and ``Republic of 
Niger''.
    (3) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, 
Guinea, and Niger are lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
countries.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8742 of October 31, 2011

To Modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 
(the ``1988 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States 
International Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') to keep the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous 
review and periodically to recommend to the President such modifications 
to the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to 
accomplish the purposes

[[Page 145]]

set forth in that subsection. Among those purposes are to promote the 
uniform application of the International Convention on the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System (the ``Convention'') and to 
alleviate unnecessary administrative burdens.
2. The Commission conducted an investigation pursuant to section 1205 of 
the 1988 Act (Investigation No. 1205-8) in response to a request from 
the Department of the Treasury regarding certain footwear featuring 
outer soles of rubber or plastic to which a layer of textile material 
has been added. The request stated that changes to the HTS would promote 
the uniform application of the Convention as well as alleviate 
unnecessary administrative burdens.
3. On August 9, 2010, the Commission issued a report in Investigation 
No. 1205-8, recommending certain changes to the HTS. The report and 
layover requirements of section 1206(b) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 
3006(b)) were satisfied as of March 30, 2011.
4. On November 8, 2010, the United States Trade Representative (the 
``USTR'') requested that the Commission make further recommendations 
consistent with section 1205(d) of the 1988 Act concerning particular 
provisions of the HTS that the Commission had recommended in its August 
report be replaced by new tariff lines. The USTR also asked the 
Commission to consider whether, in response to requests made by 
interested parties in the course of the original investigation, 
additional tariff lines should be inserted in the HTS.
5. On February 18, 2011, the Commission issued an addendum to its 
report, recommending additional modifications to the HTS. The report and 
layover requirements of section 1206(b) were satisfied as of June 30, 
2011.
6. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the 
President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on recommendations 
made by the Commission pursuant to section 1205 of the 1988 Act, if he 
determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States 
obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national 
economic interest of the United States. I have determined that the 
modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex I to this proclamation are 
in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do 
not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.
7. On June 6, 2003, the United States and Chile entered into the United 
States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA). The Congress approved the 
USCFTA in section 101(a) of the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``USCFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3805 note). 
Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
USCFTA with respect to the United States, and incorporated in the HTS 
the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to 
carry out the USCFTA.
8. Section 202 of the USCFTA Act provides rules for determining whether 
goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a 
USCFTA Party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment 
contemplated under the USCFTA. Section 202(o)(2)(A) authorizes the 
President to proclaim, subject to the consultation and layover 
requirements of section 103(a) of the USCFTA Act, modifications to such 
previously proclaimed rules of origin.

[[Page 146]]

9. The United States and Chile have agreed to modify certain rules of 
origin and to add certain other rules of origin in the USCFTA. I have 
determined that further modification of the USCFTA rules of origin set 
forth in Proclamation 7746, and subsequently modified, is therefore 
necessary.
10. The consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) of the 
USCFTA Act were satisfied as of July 10, 2010.
11. On April 15, 1994, the United States entered into trade agreements 
resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (the 
``Uruguay Round Agreements''). In section 101(a) of the Uruguay Round 
Agreements Act (the ``URAA'') (19 U.S.C. 3511(a)), the Congress approved 
the Uruguay Round Agreements listed in section 101(d) of that Act, 
including the Agreement on Agriculture in section 101(d)(2). To 
implement section 4.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture, section 401(b)(2) 
of the URAA amended section 103B of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 
U.S.C. 1444-2) by converting the special import quotas on cotton 
provided for under section 103B to tariff-rate quotas.
12. Proclamation 6301 of June 7, 1991, and Proclamation 6948 of October 
29, 1996, modified U.S. note 6 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the 
HTS and created tariff lines in the HTS for reporting entries under a 
special import quota for upland cotton. Note 6 sets out the conditions 
under which a special import quota for upland cotton takes effect.
13. Section 1207(a)(2)(B) of the Food Conservation and Energy Act of 
2008 (7 U.S.C. 8737(a)(2)(B)) changed the conditions under which a 
special import quota for upland cotton takes effect. U.S. note 6 to 
subchapter III of chapter 99 needs to be modified to reflect those 
changes.
14. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts, 
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the 
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or 
other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 1206 of the 1988 Act, section 202 of the USCFTA Act, and section 
604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to modify the HTS to promote the uniform application of 
the Convention and to alleviate unnecessary administrative burdens, the

Proclamation 8743 of November 1, 2011

Military Family Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

With every step we take on American soil, we tread on ground made safer 
for us through the invaluable sacrifices of our service members and 
their families. During Military Family Month, we celebrate the 
exceptional service, strength, and sacrifice of our military families, 
whose commitment to our Nation goes above and beyond the call of duty.
Just as our troops embody the courage and character that make America's 
military the finest in the world, their family members embody the 
resilience and generosity that make our communities strong. They serve 
with heroism in their homes and neighborhoods while they are without the 
comfort of having loved ones nearby. Day after day, week after week, 
spouses resolutely accomplish the work of two parents, sons and 
daughters diligently keep up with homework and activities, and parents 
and grandparents patiently wait for news of their child and grandchild's 
safe return. To these families, and to those whose service members never 
come home, we bear a debt that can never be fully repaid.
As Americans, we are at our best when we honor and uphold our 
obligations to one another and to those who have given so much to our 
country. Earlier this year, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden 
challenged all Americans to serve those who sacrifice in our name with 
the Joining Forces initiative. Joining Forces strives to enlist support 
for our men and women in uniform and our veterans not only when they are 
away at war, but at every stage of their lives. My Administration is 
dedicated to doing more for our military families by enhancing learning 
opportunities for our military children, championing our military 
spouses as they advance their careers and education, and providing 
better mental health counseling to heal the wounds left in war's wake.
Our service members swore an oath to protect and defend, and with each 
step we take on this land we cherish, we remember our steadfast promise 
to protect the well-being of the family members they hold dear. Every 
act of kindness we can offer helps cultivate a culture of support for 
our military families, and I encourage each American to make a 
difference in the lives of these patriots.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2011 as 
Military Family Month. I call on all Americans to honor military 
families through private actions and public service for the tremendous 
contributions they make in the support of our service members and our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8744 of November 1, 2011

National Adoption Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, one of our highest responsibilities is to ensure the health 
and well-being of our children. With generous hearts and open minds, we 
strive to make sure all children grow up knowing they have a family that 
shares with them the warmth, security, and unconditional love that will 
help them succeed. And yet, more than 100,000 children in America await 
this most basic support, and still more children abroad live without 
families. During National Adoption Month, we celebrate the acts of 
compassion and love that unite children with adoptive families, and we 
rededicate ourselves to the essential task of providing all children 
with the comfort and safety of a permanent home.
The decision to adopt a child has brought profound joy and meaning into 
the lives of Americans across our country. Parents are moved to adopt 
for reasons as unique and varied as the children they embrace, but they 
are unified by the remarkable grace of their acts. Adoptive families 
come in all forms. With so many children waiting for loving homes, it is 
important to ensure that all qualified caregivers are given the 
opportunity to serve as adoptive parents, regardless of race, religion, 
sexual orientation, or marital status.
My Administration remains steadfast in our support of adoptive families 
and children in need of homes. Earlier this year, I signed the Child and 
Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act, which reauthorizes child 
welfare programs and makes new provisions to help reduce the amount of 
time young children are without permanent families. I also signed the 
Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act to provide balanced, nutritious meals to 
all children in the foster care system. Last year, during National 
Adoption Month, I signed the International Adoption Simplification Act, 
which removed unnecessary regulations and barriers to international 
adoption. These efforts come in addition to the Adoption Tax Credit, 
which was extended and expanded as part of the Affordable Care Act to 
make adoption more accessible to American families. Through these key 
pieces of legislation, my Administration is moving forward with our 
commitment to stand with youth in foster care and find new ways to 
encourage adoption.
Adoption has become a part of many Americans' lives and has contributed 
to the character of our Nation. As parents and as family members, it is 
our task to do all we can to give our children the very best. In caring 
for our youth and putting them before ourselves, we make a lasting 
investment not only in their future, but also in the prosperity and 
strength of our Nation in the years to come. This month and throughout 
the year, let us recommit to ensuring every child is given the 
sustaining love of family, the assurance of a permanent home, and the 
supportive upbringing they deserve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2011 as 
National Adoption Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month

[[Page 168]]

by answering the call to find homes for every child in America in need 
of a permanent and caring family, and to support the families who care 
for them.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8745 of November 1, 2011

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For millions of Americans, the heartbreak of watching a loved one 
struggle with Alzheimer's disease is a pain they know all too well. 
Alzheimer's disease burdens an increasing number of our Nation's elders 
and their families, and it is essential that we confront the challenge 
it poses to our public health. During National Alzheimer's Disease 
Awareness Month, we stand united in our commitment to improve care for 
Alzheimer's patients, identify new therapies for the disease, and 
support all those whose lives have been touched by this tragic ailment.
As we confront the challenges of supporting an aging population, my 
Administration is dedicated to advancing research that brings us closer 
to understanding and treating Alzheimer's disease. In January, I signed 
the National Alzheimer's Project Act, which calls for an aggressive and 
coordinated national strategy to enable earlier diagnosis of the 
disease, improve strategies for long-term care, and accelerate the 
search for a cure by promoting collaboration among researchers. The Act 
also establishes an Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and 
Services, which brings together some of our Nation's foremost experts on 
Alzheimer's disease to ensure our efforts do the most good for patients 
and their families.
My Administration, in collaboration with a variety of private and public 
partners, is making headway in the fight to eliminate Alzheimer's 
disease. Research funded by the National Institutes of Health has 
identified genetic markers that may indicate increased risk of 
developing Alzheimer's, and researchers across our Nation and around the 
world continue to shed new light on the disease. These discoveries bring 
us closer than ever to lifting the immense physical, emotional, and 
financial burdens that Alzheimer's disease imposes upon aging Americans 
and their families.
This month, we remember the Americans we have lost to Alzheimer's 
disease, and we stand with the individuals and families who have felt 
the pain and sorrow brought in its wake. In light of their hardship, let 
us make every effort to support the families, caregivers, medical 
professionals, and researchers who improve the lives of those affected 
by this disease. We join them in looking toward a future free of 
Alzheimer's disease, and we recommit to making that vision a reality.

[[Page 169]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2011 as 
National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of 
the United States to learn more about Alzheimer's disease and to offer 
their support to the individuals living with this disease and to their 
caregivers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8746 of November 1, 2011

National Diabetes Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Though we have made substantial progress in combating diabetes, the 
number of Americans burdened by this disease continues to grow at a 
rapid pace. During National Diabetes Month, we commemorate the work of 
caregivers, researchers, medical professionals, and advocates who lead 
the fight against diabetes, and we recommit to educating ourselves and 
our communities about how we can manage, treat, and prevent this 
disease.
Diabetes can have a devastating impact on the health and well-being of 
those it affects, and it remains an urgent threat to our public health. 
In addition to immediate health issues, people with diabetes are more 
likely to suffer from complications such as heart attacks, strokes, high 
blood pressure, or kidney failure. Most often diagnosed in young people, 
Type 1 diabetes inhibits the body's ability to produce insulin and can 
be managed with insulin injections, diet, and exercise. Research 
suggests that, unlike Type 1 diabetes, it is possible to prevent or 
delay Type 2 diabetes. Yet, Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 percent of 
diabetes cases in the United States, and it continues to grow more 
prevalent in adults and children alike. It is essential that all 
Americans take steps to assess and reduce their risk of developing Type 
2 diabetes by adopting a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and 
consulting a medical professional about their individual needs and risk 
factors.
My Administration remains committed to advancing diabetes education, 
research, prevention, and treatment. The National Diabetes Education 
Program--a partnership between the National Institutes of Health, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than 200 public and 
private organizations--works to improve outcomes for people living with 
diabetes, encourage early diagnosis, and prevent or delay the onset of 
Type 2 diabetes. In addition, the National Diabetes Prevention Program 
serves as part of a coordinated national strategy to reduce the 
prevalence of Type 2 diabetes by encouraging healthy eating habits and 
offering group support for adults who are striving to lose weight and 
get physically active. The Affordable Care Act ensures that all 
Americans joining a new health plan can receive recommended preventive 
services, like diabetes screenings, with no out-of-

[[Page 170]]

pocket costs. And, by 2014, Americans will not be denied insurance 
coverage because they have diabetes or other pre-existing conditions.
The increase in Type 2 diabetes among our Nation's children is linked to 
the rise of childhood obesity. To end the epidemic of childhood obesity 
within a generation, First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative 
is inspiring children to be physically active and empowering parents and 
caregivers to make healthy choices for their families. By encouraging 
our sons and daughters to develop healthy habits today, we help ensure 
they have a brighter, healthier tomorrow.
During National Diabetes Month, we remember those we have lost to 
diabetes, and we stand with the millions of Americans who have been 
touched by its consequences. As a Nation, it is our task to reduce the 
incidence of this illness and offer care and support to those it 
affects. This month and throughout the year, let us continue to pursue a 
diabetes-free future for our children, our families, and all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2011 as 
National Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans, school systems, 
government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health care providers, 
research institutions, and other interested groups to join in activities 
that raise diabetes awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage the 
disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8747 of November 1, 2011

National Entrepreneurship Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From inventing the traffic light to developing the artificial heart, our 
Nation's doers, makers, and entrepreneurs have proven time and again 
that, in America, it takes only a single good idea and the courage to 
pursue it to change history. In fulfilling this simple promise, these 
visionaries play a critical role in sparking new industries, expanding 
our economy, and generating new job growth across our country. This 
month, we celebrate the remarkable and everyday successes of our 
entrepreneurs and innovators, and we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring 
that our economy remains the engine and the envy of the world.
Earlier this year, my Administration launched the Startup America 
initiative, which accelerates the success of our entrepreneurs by 
unlocking access to capital, cutting red tape, and expanding mentorship 
and educational opportunities. The initiative works to improve the 
climate for all high-growth companies, and includes specific provisions 
to bring expertise and services to entrepreneurial scientists, students, 
immigrants, and veterans.

[[Page 171]]

Startup America also coordinates action across the Federal Government to 
bolster private investment in early-stage companies, helping ensure that 
our best ideas have a chance to get off the ground and into the 
marketplace. By making it faster and easier for entrepreneurs to turn 
new ideas into new businesses and new jobs, we are building an 
innovation economy that will propel our Nation into the future.
To fast-track our startups and enable them to bring products to market 
more quickly, I signed the America Invents Act in September of this 
year. This essential legislation will help entrepreneurs and inventors 
secure a patent three times faster than they can today, drastically 
cutting the time it takes to roll out novel technologies and products. 
The Act will also improve the quality of our patents and do more to give 
entrepreneurs the protection and confidence they need to attract 
investment, grow their businesses, and hire more workers. We stand at a 
moment when our Nation's economy must become more dynamic and flexible 
than ever before, and these reforms will help us meet this challenge.
My Administration is also working to create new opportunities for 
collaboration within the private sector. Run by and for entrepreneurs, 
the independent Startup America Partnership has assembled an extensive 
network of mentors, advisors, investors, and established corporations to 
share strategic assets with our country's next great innovators. This 
movement harnesses the agility, intelligence, and ingenuity that has 
powered our success for generations and uses it to fuel our growth in 
rapidly evolving, global markets.
The task of making America competitive throughout the 21st century is a 
job for all of us. By cultivating innovation on our college and 
university campuses, we can inspire the next generation of 
entrepreneurial leaders. With the help of experienced entrepreneurs and 
companies, and through events like Global Entrepreneurship Week, which 
begins on November 14, we can ensure our startups have access to the 
resources, connections, and partnerships that will promote their 
success. To encourage great ideas in all parts of our country, our 
lending institutions, foundations, and investors can finance vibrant 
entrepreneurial ecosystems that extend to our rural and underserved 
communities. By pooling our talents and investing in the creativity and 
imagination of our people, we can move forward with the spirit of hope 
and ambition that has defined our past and will drive our Nation in the 
years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2011 as 
National Entrepreneurship Month. I call upon all Americans to 
commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8748 of November 1, 2011

National Family Caregivers Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our country, millions of family members, neighbors, and friends 
provide care and support for their loved ones during times of need. With 
profound compassion and selflessness, these caregivers sustain American 
men, women, and children at their most vulnerable moments, and through 
their devoted acts, they exemplify the best of the American spirit. 
During National Family Caregivers Month, we pay tribute to the 
individuals throughout America who ensure the health and well-being of 
their relatives and loved ones.
Many of our Nation's family caregivers assist seniors and people with 
disabilities to help improve their quality of life. Their efforts help 
deliver short-term comfort and security, facilitate social engagement, 
and help individuals stay in their homes and communities as long as 
possible. This heroic work is often done while caregivers balance other 
commitments to their families, jobs, and communities. As these 
remarkable individuals put their own lives on hold to tend to their 
family members, it is our responsibility to ensure they do not have to 
do it alone.
To ease the emotional and financial burdens that can accompany 
caregiving, my Administration has striven to support family caregivers 
for the crucial role they perform. Vice President Joe Biden's Middle 
Class Task Force has focused on the importance or investing in respite 
care, counseling, and training for individuals who serve aging 
Americans. These initiatives would give family caregivers a leg up as 
they continue to support their aging loved ones.
One of our Nation's greatest responsibilities is to ensure our veterans, 
their families, and their caregivers receive lasting and comprehensive 
support. Last year, I signed the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health 
Services Act, which helps fulfill this obligation by extending 
additional assistance to family members who care for severely wounded 
veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Our military caregivers exemplify 
the heroism found not only on the fields of battle, but also in the 
hearts of those who tend to our wounded warriors when they come home.
As we observe National Family Caregivers Month, we honor the tireless 
compassion of Americans who heal, comfort, and support our injured, our 
elders, and people with disabilities. This month and throughout the 
year, let the quiet perseverance of our family caregivers remind us of 
the decency and kindness to which we can all aspire.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2011 as 
National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to pay 
tribute to those who provide for the health and well-being of their 
family members, friends, and neighbors.

Proclamation 8749 of November 1, 2011

National Native American Heritage Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the Aleutian Islands to the Florida Everglades, American Indians 
and Alaska Natives have contributed immensely to our country's heritage. 
During National Native American Heritage Month, we commemorate their 
enduring achievements and reaffirm the vital role American Indians and 
Alaska Natives play in enriching the character of our Nation.
Native Americans stand among America's most distinguished authors, 
artists, scientists, and political leaders, and in their 
accomplishments, they have profoundly strengthened the legacy we will 
leave our children. So, too, have American Indians and Alaska Natives 
bravely fought to protect this legacy as members of our Armed Forces. As 
service members, they have shown exceptional valor and heroism on 
battlefields from the American Revolution to Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Native Americans have demonstrated time and again their commitment to 
advancing our common goals, and we honor their resolve in the face of 
years of marginalization and broken promises. My Administration 
recognizes the painful chapters in our shared history, and we are fully 
committed to moving forward with American Indians and Alaska Natives to 
build a better future together.
To strengthen our economy and win the future for our children, my 
Administration is addressing problems that have burdened Native American 
communities for too long. We are working to bolster economic 
development, expand access to affordable health care, broaden post-
secondary educational opportunities, and ensure public safety and tribal 
justice. In June, I signed an Executive Order establishing the White 
House Rural Council, to strengthen Federal engagement with tribal 
governments and promote economic prosperity in Indian Country and across 
rural America. This comes in conjunction with several settlements that 
will put more land into the hands of tribes and deliver long-awaited 
trust reform to Indian Country.
To bring jobs and sustainable growth to tribal nations, my 
Administration is connecting tribal economies to the broader economy 
through transportation infrastructure and high-speed Internet, as well 
as by focusing on clean energy development on tribal lands. First Lady 
Michelle Obama's recently launched Let's Move! in Indian Country 
initiative will also redouble efforts to encourage healthy living for 
American Indians and Alaska Natives. These actions reflect my 
Administration's ongoing commitment to progress for Native Americans, 
which was reaffirmed last year when we announced our support for the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Through 
a comprehensive strategy where the Federal

[[Page 174]]

Government and tribal nations move forward as equal partners, we can 
bring real and lasting change to Indian Country.
This month, we celebrate the rich heritage and myriad contributions of 
American Indians and Alaska Natives, and we rededicate ourselves to 
supporting tribal sovereignty, tribal self-determination, and prosperity 
for all Native Americans. We will seek to strengthen our nation-to-
nation relationship by ensuring tribal nations have a voice in shaping 
national policies impacting tribal communities. We will continue this 
dialogue at the White House Tribal Nations Conference held in 
Washington, D.C. next month. As we confront the challenges currently 
facing our tribal communities and work to ensure American Indians and 
Alaska Natives have meaningful opportunities to pursue their dreams, we 
are forging a brighter future for the First Americans and all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2011 as 
National Native American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to 
commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities, and to 
celebrate November 25, 2011, as Native American Heritage Day.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8750 of November 1, 2011

Establishment of the Fort Monroe National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Known first as ``The Gibraltar of the Chesapeake'' and later as 
``Freedom's Fortress,'' Fort Monroe on Old Point Comfort in Virginia has 
a storied history in the defense of our Nation and the struggle for 
freedom.
Fort Monroe, designed by Simon Bernard and built of stone and brick 
between 1819 and 1834 in part by enslaved labor, is the largest of the 
Third System of fortifications in the United States. It has been a 
bastion of defense of the Chesapeake Bay, a stronghold of the Union Army 
surrounded by the Confederacy, a place of freedom for the enslaved, and 
the imprisonment site of Chief Blackhawk and the President of the 
Confederacy, Jefferson Davis. It served as the U.S. Army's Coastal 
Defense Artillery School during the 19th and 20th centuries, and most 
recently, as headquarters of the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine 
Command.
Old Point Comfort in present day Hampton, Virginia, was originally named 
``Pointe Comfort'' by Captain John Smith in 1607 when the first English 
colonists came to America. It was here that the settlers of Jamestown 
established Fort Algernon in 1609. After Fort Algernon's destruction by 
fire in 1612, successive English fortifications were built, testifying 
to the location's

[[Page 175]]

continuing strategic value. The first enslaved Africans in England's 
colonies in America were brought to this peninsula on a ship flying the 
Dutch flag in 1619, beginning a long ignoble period of slavery in the 
colonies and, later, this Nation. Two hundred and forty-two years later, 
Fort Monroe became a place of refuge for those later generations 
escaping enslavement.
During the Civil War, Fort Monroe stood as a foremost Union outpost in 
the midst of the Confederacy and remained under Union Army control 
during the entire conflict. The Fort was the site of General Benjamin 
Butler's ``Contraband Decision'' in 1861, which provided a pathway to 
freedom for thousands of enslaved people during the Civil War and served 
as a forerunner of President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation 
of 1863. Thus, Old Point Comfort marks both the beginning and end of 
slavery in our Nation. The Fort played critical roles as the springboard 
for General George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign in 1862 and as a 
crucial supply base for the siege of Petersburg by Union forces under 
General Ulysses S. Grant in 1864 and 1865. After the surrender of the 
Confederacy, Confederate President Jefferson Davis was transferred to 
Fort Monroe and remained imprisoned there for 2 years.
Fort Monroe is the third oldest United States Army post in continuous 
active service. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 
and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It 
provides an excellent opportunity for the public to observe and 
understand Chesapeake Bay and Civil War history. At the northern end of 
the North Beach area lies the only undeveloped shoreline remaining on 
Old Point Comfort, providing modern-day visitors a sense of what earlier 
people saw when they arrived in the New World. The North Beach area also 
includes coastal defensive batteries, including Batteries DeRussy and 
Church, which were used from the 19th Century to World War II.
WHEREAS section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act''), authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled 
by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
WHEREAS the 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission 
recommended that Fort Monroe cease to be used as an Army installation, 
and pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 
(Public Law 101-510), Fort Monroe closed on September 15, 2011;
WHEREAS the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Members of 
Congress, the Fort Monroe Authority, the City of Hampton, Virginia, and 
other surrounding counties and cities have expressed support for 
establishing a unit of the National Park System at Fort Monroe;
WHEREAS it is in the public interest to preserve Fort Monroe, portions 
of Old Point Comfort, and certain lands and buildings necessary for the 
care and management of the Fort and Point as the Fort Monroe National 
Monument;

[[Page 176]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Antiquities 
Act, hereby proclaim that all lands and interests in lands owned or 
controlled by the Government of the United States within the boundaries 
described on the accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part 
of this proclamation, are hereby set apart and reserved as the Fort 
Monroe National Monument (monument) for the purpose of protecting the 
objects identified above. The reserved Federal lands and interests in 
lands encompass approximately 325.21 acres, together with appurtenant 
easements for all necessary purposes, which is the smallest area 
compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be 
protected.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of this 
monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, 
location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the 
public land laws, including withdrawal from location, entry, and patent 
under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to 
mineral and geothermal leasing. Lands and interests in lands within the 
monument's boundaries not owned or controlled by the United States shall 
be reserved as part of the monument upon acquisition of ownership or 
control by the United States.
The lands and interests in lands within the monument's boundaries, 
except for the Old Point Comfort Lighthouse, are currently managed by 
the Secretary of the Army. The Secretaries of the Army and the Interior 
shall enter into a memorandum of agreement that identifies and assigns 
the responsibilities of each agency related to such lands and interests 
in lands, the implementing actions required of each agency, the 
processes for transferring administrative jurisdiction over such lands 
and interests in lands to the Secretary of the Interior, and the 
processes for resolving interagency disputes. After issuance of this 
proclamation, the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the 
Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service, 
will continue to manage the lands and interests in lands within the 
monument boundaries, to the extent they remain in the ownership or 
control of the Government of the United States, until the transfer to 
the Secretary of the Interior is completed in accordance with the 
memorandum of agreement. The Secretary of the Interior shall then manage 
the monument through the National Park Service, pursuant to applicable 
legal authorities, consistent with the purposes and provisions of this 
proclamation, and in accordance with the memorandum of agreement.
The Old Point Comfort Lighthouse shall continue to be managed by the 
Secretary of Homeland Security. Not later than 1 year after the date of 
this proclamation, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall enter into an interagency agreement that, to the 
extent requested by the United States Coast Guard, provides for 
appropriate National Park Service interpretation of the Old Point 
Comfort Lighthouse for the public and for technical or financial 
assistance by the National Park Service for building treatment and other 
preservation activities. Nothing in this proclamation shall limit or 
interfere with the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security to 
use the Old Point Comfort Lighthouse for navigational or national 
security purposes.
For the purpose of preserving, restoring, and enhancing the public 
visitation and appreciation of the monument, the Secretary of the 
Interior shall

[[Page 177]]

prepare a management plan for the monument within 3 years of the date of 
this proclamation. The management plan will ensure that the monument 
fulfill the following purposes for the benefit of present and future 
generations: (1) to preserve historic, natural, and recreational 
resources; (2) to provide land- and water-based recreational 
opportunities; and (3) to communicate the historical significance of the 
monument as described above. The management plan shall, among other 
provisions, set forth the desired relationship of the monument to other 
related resources, programs, and organizations in the Hampton area and 
other locations, provide for maximum public involvement in its 
development, and identify steps to be taken to provide interpretive 
opportunities for the entirety of the Fort Monroe National Historic 
Landmark and related sites in Hampton, Virginia. In developing the 
management plan, the Secretary of the Interior shall consider the Fort 
Monroe Reuse Plan, the Fort Monroe Programmatic Agreement dated April 
27, 2009 (and any amendments to the agreement), and the Commonwealth of 
Virginia Fort Monroe Authority Act. Further, to the extent authorized by 
law, the Secretary of the Interior shall promulgate any additional 
regulations needed for the proper care and management of the monument.
The establishment of this monument is subject to valid existing rights. 
To the extent that the Commonwealth of Virginia holds any reversionary 
rights in any Federal lands or interests in lands within the boundaries 
of this monument, those rights are preserved and may operate or be 
exercised in due course without affecting the existence or designated 
boundaries of the monument. The Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia 
and the Fort Monroe Authority, which would have responsibility for such 
lands and interests in lands upon their reversion, have agreed in 
principle to then relinquish to the United States ownership or control 
of those lands and interests in lands, as stated in the Governor's 
letter agreement of September 9, 2011. The Secretary of the Interior 
shall accept the relinquishment of such lands and interests in lands on 
behalf of the Government of the United States, at which point such lands 
and interests in lands, reserved pursuant to this proclamation, shall be 
managed by the Secretary of the Interior, through the National Park 
Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, consistent with the 
purposes and provisions of this proclamation, and in accordance with the 
memorandum of agreement.
Nothing in this proclamation shall affect the responsibilities of the 
Department of the Army under applicable environmental laws, including 
the remediation of hazardous substances or munitions and explosives of 
concern within the monument boundaries; nor affect the Department of the 
Army's statutory authority to control public access or statutory 
responsibility to make other measures for environmental remediation, 
monitoring, security, safety or emergency preparedness purposes; nor 
affect any Department of the Army activities on lands not included 
within the monument.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing 
withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall 
be the dominant reservation.
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, 
injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to 
locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.

Proclamation 8751 of November 3, 2011

Veterans Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, our Nation comes together to honor our veterans and commemorate 
the legacy of profound service and sacrifice they have upheld in pursuit 
of a more perfect Union. Through their steadfast defense of America's 
ideals, our service members have ensured our country still stands 
strong, our founding principles still shine, and nations around the 
world know the blessings of freedom. As we offer our sincere 
appreciation and respect to our veterans, to their families, to those 
who are still in harm's way, and to those we have laid to rest, let us 
rededicate ourselves to serving them as well as they have served the 
United States of America.
Our men and women in uniform are bearers of a proud military tradition 
that has been dutifully passed forward--from generation to generation--
for more than two centuries. In times of war and peace alike, our 
veterans have served with courage and distinction in the face of 
tremendous adversity, demonstrating an unfaltering commitment to America 
and our people. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the 
country they loved. The selflessness of our service members is 
unmatched, and they remind us that there are few things more 
fundamentally American than doing our utmost to make a difference in the 
lives of others.
Just as our veterans stood watch on freedom's frontier, so have they 
safeguarded the prosperity of our Nation in our neighborhoods, our 
businesses, and our homes. As teachers and engineers, doctors and 
parents, these patriots have made contributions to civilian life that 
serve as a testament to their dedication to the welfare of our country. 
We owe them a debt of honor, and it is our moral obligation to ensure 
they receive our support for as long as they live as proud veterans of 
the United States Armed Forces. This year, as our troops in Iraq 
complete their mission, we will honor them and all who serve by working 
tirelessly to give them the care, the benefits, and the opportunities 
they have earned.
On Veterans Day, we pay tribute to our veterans, to the fallen, and to 
their families. To honor their contributions to our Nation, let us 
strive with renewed determination to keep the promises we have made to 
all who have answered our country's call. As we fulfill our obligations 
to them, we keep faith with the patriots who have risked their lives to 
preserve our Union, and with the ideals of service and sacrifice upon 
which our Republic was founded.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service 
members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's 
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2011, as Veterans Day. I 
encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our 
veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers. I 
call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the 
United States

[[Page 181]]

and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I call 
on all Americans, including civic and fraternal organizations, places of 
worship, schools, and communities to support this day with commemorative 
expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8752 of November 8, 2011

World Freedom Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On November 9, 1989, the German people broke through a barrier that 
divided their nation, demonstrating no wall is strong enough to hold 
back the rising tide of human liberty. There could be no clearer rebuke 
of tyranny, nor a stronger affirmation of freedom. On World Freedom Day, 
we commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall, celebrate the resilience of 
the human spirit, and stand with all those who live in the darkness of 
oppression and believe in the hope of a brighter day.
This pivotal moment in the global march toward liberty heralded a new 
era in Europe and around the world. Today, we once again find ourselves 
at a crossroads of history as a wave of democratic movements sweeps away 
oppressive dictatorships in the Middle East and North Africa.
Just as the United States supported the aspirations of those who emerged 
from behind the Iron Curtain, we continue to stand with all who seek 
their universal rights and reach for a future that offers dignity, 
justice, equality, personal freedom, and greater economic opportunity. 
Recent developments in the Middle East and North Africa remind us that 
the pursuit of liberty endures. As people around the world embrace the 
cause of human freedom, they take steps toward a more stable and 
prosperous future.
Today, we pay tribute to the brave individuals who, despite all risks, 
tear down barriers that obstruct democracy and justice for all. Let us 
keep in our thoughts those who still live under totalitarian regimes, 
and let us honor their courage to hold fast to the promise of a better 
future. On World Freedom Day, we renew our commitment to all who 
believe--even in the face of cynicism, doubt, and oppression--that walls 
truly can come down.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2011, as 
World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming 
our dedication to freedom and democracy.

[[Page 182]]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8753 of November 14, 2011

American Education Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ensuring our future leaders and innovators receive a complete and 
competitive education is fundamental to our Nation's economic prosperity 
and our role as a thriving democracy. During American Education Week, we 
acknowledge the central role education plays in our society and resolve 
to make rigorous and lasting investments in our education system so the 
American dream remains within reach of each of our children.
From small towns to our largest cities, schools serve as laboratories 
where students test new ideas and kindle new academic interests. In the 
classroom, young people cultivate scholarship, discover talents they 
never knew they had, and build the skills they need to pursue careers of 
their choosing. And with every step they take toward their future, our 
students are guided by men and women who work tirelessly to help them 
realize their full potential. Teachers, administrators, and other 
education professionals are unfaltering in their dedication to giving 
children the education they deserve, and it is essential we do our part 
to help them succeed. To secure a bright future for our students and our 
Nation, we must support educators by strengthening our schools, creating 
better opportunities for professional development, and recruiting top 
college graduates to be our next generation of devoted teachers.
The task of preparing our children for a lifetime of scholarship and 
achievement rests not only in the classroom, but also in our homes and 
neighborhoods. Parents, community leaders, and mentors play a vital role 
in cultivating a love of learning and instilling in our children the 
self-confidence, creativity, and discipline that serve as a foundation 
for success. Together, our families, schools, and communities carry a 
profound responsibility to do right by our children. This week and 
throughout the year, let us strive to fulfill that promise.
By working toward thoughtful education reform and making every classroom 
a place of high expectations and high performance, we can take steps to 
ensure our future generations are prepared to uphold our founding 
promise of opportunity, and to make great discoveries and develop 
groundbreaking ideas here in America. During American Education Week, we 
renew our promise to give our children the chance to achieve their 
dreams and to write the next proud chapter in the American story.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 13 through

[[Page 183]]

November 19, 2011, as American Education Week. I call upon all Americans 
to observe this week by supporting their local schools through 
appropriate activities, events, and programs designed to help create 
opportunities for every school and student in America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8754 of November 15, 2011

America Recycles Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, we have a responsibility to ensure future generations 
benefit from an abundance of natural resources and a healthy planet. To 
meet this obligation, we must take steps to consume carefully, recycle a 
wide variety of products and materials, and reuse whenever possible. On 
America Recycles Day, we celebrate the commitment of individuals across 
our country to live sustainably, and we rededicate ourselves to 
thoughtful resource management at home and in the workplace.
For decades, American families have advanced the common good of our 
Nation by recycling regularly and promoting conservation. During the 
First and Second World Wars, families participated in scrap drives, 
gathering cloth, paper, and metals for reuse in manufacturing that 
helped fuel our military and our economic growth. Since then, we have 
bolstered recycling programs through individual action, community 
engagement, and national initiatives, and we have broadened our efforts 
to include a vast array of pioneering industrial processes that will 
drive our clean economy and create green jobs. These advances cut waste, 
preserve our natural bounty, and spur the robust and sustainable 
economic growth that will carry us through this century and into the 
next.
To meet the economic and environmental challenges that confront our 
country today, we must update and expand existing recycling programs and 
dedicate ourselves to devising new strategies to accommodate emerging 
technologies. Our Nation generates over two million tons of used 
electronics annually, and without following proper recycling and 
management practices, the disposal of our old computers, monitors, and 
cell phones can release toxic materials into our environment, endanger 
human health, and prevent the recovery and reuse of valuable resources. 
For the well-being of our people and our planet, we must consider the 
full lifecycle impacts of our products and strive to manage our 
resources in a sustainable way.
To ensure America remains a global leader in developing new, sustainable 
electronics technologies, my Administration launched the National 
Strategy for Electronics Stewardship earlier this year. The strategy 
establishes a framework for responsible electronics design, purchasing, 
management, and recycling that will accelerate our burgeoning 
electronics recycling market

[[Page 184]]

and create jobs for the future here at home. To lead by example, my 
Administration is committed to efficient use, reuse, and proper disposal 
of electronics within the Federal Government, and we are collaborating 
with certified recycling centers to handle and dispose of used 
electronics safely and effectively. We are also forging new partnerships 
with the private sector that will advance electronics recycling across 
our country. Through collaboration and shared responsibility, we are 
protecting public health, preserving environmental quality, and laying 
the foundation for a 21st-century economy.
America Recycles Day offers us an opportunity to reflect on the 
remarkable strides we have made in the pursuit of sustainability, and to 
challenge ourselves to do even more. As we rise to meet this challenge, 
we fulfill a promise to our children that they will inherit a world more 
beautiful and prosperous than the one we received.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2011, as 
America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I 
encourage all Americans to continue their recycling efforts throughout 
the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8755 of November 16, 2011

Thanksgiving Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One of our Nation's oldest and most cherished traditions, Thanksgiving 
Day brings us closer to our loved ones and invites us to reflect on the 
blessings that enrich our lives. The observance recalls the celebration 
of an autumn harvest centuries ago, when the Wampanoag tribe joined the 
Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony to share in the fruits of a bountiful 
season. The feast honored the Wampanoag for generously extending their 
knowledge of local game and agriculture to the Pilgrims, and today we 
renew our gratitude to all American Indians and Alaska Natives. We take 
this time to remember the ways that the First Americans have enriched 
our Nation's heritage, from their generosity centuries ago to the 
everyday contributions they make to all facets of American life. As we 
come together with friends, family, and neighbors to celebrate, let us 
set aside our daily concerns and give thanks for the providence bestowed 
upon us.
Though our traditions have evolved, the spirit of grace and humility at 
the heart of Thanksgiving has persisted through every chapter of our 
story. When President George Washington proclaimed our country's first 
Thanksgiving, he praised a generous and knowing God for shepherding our 
young

[[Page 185]]

Republic through its uncertain beginnings. Decades later, President 
Abraham Lincoln looked to the divine to protect those who had known the 
worst of civil war, and to restore the Nation ``to the full enjoyment of 
peace, harmony, tranquility, and union.''
In times of adversity and times of plenty, we have lifted our hearts by 
giving humble thanks for the blessings we have received and for those 
who bring meaning to our lives. Today, let us offer gratitude to our men 
and women in uniform for their many sacrifices, and keep in our thoughts 
the families who save an empty seat at the table for a loved one 
stationed in harm's way. And as members of our American family make do 
with less, let us rededicate ourselves to our friends and fellow 
citizens in need of a helping hand.
As we gather in our communities and in our homes, around the table or 
near the hearth, we give thanks to each other and to God for the many 
kindnesses and comforts that grace our lives. Let us pause to recount 
the simple gifts that sustain us, and resolve to pay them forward in the 
year to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 24, 
2011, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage the people of the 
United States to come together--whether in our homes, places of worship, 
community centers, or any place of fellowship for friends and 
neighbors--to give thanks for all we have received in the past year, to 
express appreciation to those whose lives enrich our own, and to share 
our bounty with others.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8756 of November 18, 2011

National Family Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For generations, American families have empowered our sons and daughters 
with boundless love, giving them the courage to pursue their dreams. 
This week, we celebrate the threads of compassion and unity that tie our 
families together, enrich our communities, and strengthen the fabric of 
our Nation.
My Administration remains steadfast in our commitment to families across 
America. To ensure our children get a strong start, we are bolstering 
early learning programs and promoting education reform that will do more 
to bring every student the best our schools have to offer. By investing 
in Pell Grants and community colleges, we are working to make higher 
education affordable for more families and build a workforce of tomorrow 
that will

[[Page 186]]

excel in the global economy. And by taking executive action to lighten 
financial burdens on many middle class families, we are making it more 
affordable to pay back student loans and easier for homeowners to 
refinance their mortgages. As our families work hard to meet their 
obligations, these actions will give them the help they need to thrive 
in the years to come.
During National Family Week, let us also reflect on the contributions 
and sacrifices of our service members and their loved ones. Our troops 
and military families serve with valor at home and overseas, and as a 
Nation we have a moral obligation to serve these patriots as well as 
they have served us. To better fulfill this promise, First Lady Michelle 
Obama and Dr. Jill Biden launched Joining Forces earlier this year, an 
initiative that challenges all Americans to make a difference in the 
lives of our veterans and military families.
As we gather with our loved ones this holiday season, let us pause to 
give thanks to all those who share in the trials and triumphs of our 
lives. Our families illuminate our days and bring meaning to our years, 
and their love has the power to see us through our greatest challenges. 
This week and throughout the year, let us strive to give back to our 
friends, families, communities, and neighbors, and to work together in 
pursuit of our highest ambitions.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20 through 
November 26, 2011, as National Family Week. I invite all States, 
communities, and individuals to join in observing this week with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8757 of November 18, 2011

National Farm-City Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

With tenacity, resilience, and humility, our farmers and ranchers have 
helped drive our Nation's growth for generations. Season after season, 
their careful stewardship and dedication brings an abundance of 
wholesome food, plentiful fiber, a stronger economy, and new 
opportunities to secure our clean energy future. During National Farm-
City Week, we celebrate the essential contributions of farmers and 
ranchers to our country's well-being and recommit to a prosperous and 
sustainable future for American agriculture.
As our urban centers continue to grow, we look to our fields and ranches 
to supply our markets and families with fresh, healthy food. To help our 
farming communities meet the challenges of the 21st century, I 
established

[[Page 187]]

the White House Rural Council earlier this year. By partnering with 
leaders in rural America, we have worked to cultivate local and regional 
food systems, empower young and beginning farmers, and support rural 
businesses. Together, we stand with our rural communities and reaffirm 
our commitment to their continued success.
To make a lasting investment in our Nation's energy future, my 
Administration is taking action to promote renewable energy production 
across rural America. As part of a comprehensive strategy to build our 
clean energy economy, we are working to produce more renewable, domestic 
biofuels and to help bring solar panel arrays and wind turbines to rural 
businesses. By finding new ways to harness homegrown fuels in small 
towns and on family farms, we can create new jobs, improve our energy 
security, and unlock additional sources of income for farmers.
This week, we honor the individuals, families, and communities who 
provide us the staple foods that sustain our Nation. As we gather with 
family and friends this Thanksgiving, let us pay tribute to the men and 
women whose hard work brought the bounty we find before us from farm to 
fork.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 18 through 
November 24, 2011, as National Farm-City Week. I call upon all Americans 
to reflect on the vital contributions of those who dedicate their lives 
to promoting our Nation's agricultural abundance and environmental 
stewardship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8758 of November 18, 2011

National Child's Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we carry a fundamental responsibility to unlock the 
potential within every child. To prepare our children for the 21st 
century, we must continue to make investments in their health, 
development, and learning that will be lasting cornerstones of their 
success. Today, we celebrate our sons and daughters, and we recommit to 
giving them the future they deserve.
My Administration is committed to providing our children with the care 
and support that will give them a strong, healthy start. To help ensure 
all children have access to nutritious meals and encourage healthy 
choices early in life, I signed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act last 
year. We also launched MyPlate, a new food icon that can guide children 
and adults alike on healthy portions as they choose their next meal. 
These efforts go hand-in-hand with First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's 
Move! initiative,

[[Page 188]]

which is dedicated to solving the problem of childhood obesity within a 
generation. This year, over 1,250 schools took action to meet rigorous 
nutrition standards and expand opportunities for physical activity as 
part of our HealthierUS School Challenge, and 1.7 million Americans 
achieved the Presidential Active Lifestyle Award. By empowering children 
and their caregivers with the tools they need to eat well and lead 
active lifestyles, we take steps to instill healthy habits that will 
last into adulthood.
To build a more prosperous future for our children, we must equip them 
with a world-class education. My Administration is advancing educational 
opportunities for students of all ages, from early learning programs 
that start our children down the right path, to Pell Grants that open 
higher education to more Americans. In communities across our Nation, 
parents, teachers, principals, and school boards are coming together to 
develop stronger educational standards that will reward progress and 
accelerate student achievements. As we work to ensure every classroom is 
a safe, supportive place where students can cultivate a love of 
learning, we advance our goal of putting an outstanding education within 
reach for every child.
On National Child's Day, we remember that the promise of a brighter 
tomorrow is fulfilled by what we do for our children today. As 
Americans, all of us share in the responsibility to do our utmost to 
give our children the love, safety, and protection that will nourish 
their development as healthy and productive individuals. Let us kindle 
in them the hunger for knowledge, the courage to follow their dreams, 
and the spirit to pursue possibility wherever it may lead.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2011, as 
National Child's Day. I call upon all citizens to observe this day with 
appropriate activities, programs, and ceremonies, and to rededicate 
ourselves to creating the bright future we want for our Nation's 
children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the

support communities and countries as they build a better future. By 
promoting sustainable growth in the developing world, we spur new 
markets abroad and energize our economy here at home. By encouraging 
good governance, we empower transparency, accountability, and strong 
institutions that are responsive to citizens' needs. By driving 
innovations in agriculture, education, and global health, we strengthen 
global stability and advance our national security. And by delivering 
aid in the wake of natural disasters and humanitarian crises, we express 
the generosity and goodwill that unite us as a people.
The impact of these efforts is remarkable. In the past five decades, 
USAID has helped developing countries across the globe transform into 
stable and prosperous nations, vibrant trading partners, and foreign 
assistance donors themselves. These countries stand as beacons of hope 
for people striving toward democracy, free economies, and respect for 
human rights. The critical work of USAID enables these transitions 
forward, helping prevent and end conflict around the world.
Even after these successes, we know there is more to do. To advance 
America's interests and promote global development, USAID has instituted 
a series of ambitious reforms that will bring new partnerships, a 
greater emphasis on innovation, and a relentless focus on real results. 
These actions will help ensure we invest every development dollar in the 
most effective, efficient, and transparent way possible. And they will 
ensure that those with the greatest needs in this world are extended a 
helping hand from the American people.
On this anniversary, we honor the men and women of USAID whose 
dedication to public service has improved millions of lives around the 
world, and we honor the vision of those whose spirit of innovation has 
opened new frontiers in the global fight against hunger, poverty, and 
disease. As USAID continues to shape a brighter future for generations 
to come, its mission will remain of vital importance to our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the 50th Anniversary 
of the United States Agency for International Development. I call upon 
all Americans to observe this anniversary with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities that honor USAID and its workers, past and 
present, for their enduring commitment to a safer, more peaceful world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8760 of November 30, 2011

Critical Infrastructure Protection Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From irrigation to the Internet, our Nation's critical infrastructure 
supports an incredible array of services and industries that are 
essential to our continued success and prosperity. Critical 
infrastructure includes all systems and assets, both physical and 
virtual, that make vital contributions to our security, economic 
stability, public health, or safety. This month, we affirm the 
fundamental importance of our critical infrastructure and recommit to 
preparing for, responding to, and recovering from hazardous events and 
emergencies efficiently and effectively.
My Administration is resolute in our dedication to a safe, secure future 
for our Nation. Natural disasters, pandemic diseases, and acts of 
terrorism can pose serious risks to our critical infrastructure, and it 
is imperative we are prepared in the event of an emergency. To reduce 
risks and improve our national preparedness, we are fortifying our 
partnerships with State, local, territorial, and tribal governments to 
close gaps in our protection programs and promote collaboration at all 
levels of government. We are also engaging a wide variety of private 
stakeholders, including critical infrastructure owners and operators, to 
expand and reinforce critical infrastructure protection. And, with the 
If You See Something, Say Something campaign, we are empowering 
individuals and communities across America to help improve public 
safety. All of us have a role to play in strengthening our national 
security, and together, we are taking steps to foster a culture of 
resilience.
As we navigate new and uncertain challenges in the digital age, we must 
also address the growing threat cyber attacks present to our 
transportation networks, electricity grid, financial systems, and other 
assets and infrastructure. Cybersecurity remains a priority for my 
Administration, and we are committed to protecting our critical 
infrastructure by taking decisive action against cyber threats. To 
ensure the safety of our most vital operations, we are working to give 
public and private organizations the ability to obtain cybersecurity 
assistance quickly and effectively. These efforts will bolster our 
ability to withstand any attack, whether virtual or physical.
During Critical Infrastructure Protection Month, we reflect on our 
responsibility to protect the vital systems and assets that sustain our 
country and our people. Strengthening our national security and 
resilience is a task for all of us, and by promoting awareness and 
partnering with one another, we can make essential progress toward safe, 
secure, and prosperous horizons for every American.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2011 as 
Critical Infrastructure Protection Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to recognize the importance of protecting our Nation's 
critical resources and to observe this month with appropriate events and 
training to enhance our national security and resilience.

Proclamation 8761 of November 30, 2011

National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Though we have made progress in the fight to reduce drunk driving, our 
Nation continues to suffer an unacceptable loss of life from traffic 
accidents that involve drugs, alcohol, and distracted driving. To bring 
an end to these heartbreaking outcomes, we must take action by promoting 
rigorous enforcement measures and effective substance abuse prevention 
programs. During National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we recommit 
to preventing tragedy before it strikes by ensuring our family members 
and friends stay safe, sober, and drug-free on the road.
As we strive to reduce the damage drug use inflicts upon our 
communities, we must address the serious and growing threat drunk, 
drugged, and distracted driving poses to all Americans. Alcohol and 
drugs, both illicit and prescribed, can impair judgment, reaction time, 
motor skills, and memory, eroding a person's ability to drive safely and 
responsibly. Distracted driving, including the use of electronic 
equipment behind the wheel, can also put lives at risk. To confront 
these issues, my Administration is working to decrease the incidence of 
drugged driving by 10 percent over the next 5 years as part of our 2011 
National Drug Control Strategy. We are collaborating with State and 
local governments to bolster enforcement efforts, implement more 
effective legislation, and support successful, evidence-based prevention 
programs. These ongoing initiatives are supplemented by our Drive Sober 
or Get Pulled Over campaign, which aims to deter impaired driving during 
the holiday season.
While enforcement and legislation are critical elements of our strategy, 
we know that the parents, educators, and community leaders who work with 
young people every day are our Nation's best advocates for responsible 
decisionmaking. Research suggests that younger drivers are particularly 
susceptible to the hazards of drugged driving. To help our families and 
communities build awareness about impaired driving, my Administration 
released a toolkit that includes information about drugged driving, 
discussion guides, and tip sheets for preventing driving under the 
influence of alcohol and drugs. These materials are available with a 
variety of other resources at: www.TheAntiDrug.com.
All of us have the power to effect change and work to end drunk, 
drugged, and distracted driving in America. In our homes and 
communities, we can engage our youth and discuss the consequences of 
drug and alcohol abuse. In our clinics and hospitals, health care 
providers can redouble their efforts to recognize patients with 
substance abuse problems and offer medical intervention. And in 
governing bodies across our country, State and local

[[Page 192]]

officials can explore new legal actions that will hold drugged drivers 
accountable and encourage them to seek treatment. As we come together 
with our loved ones this holiday season, let us renew our commitment to 
drive safely, act responsibly, and live drug-free.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2011 as 
National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make 
responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired 
driving.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8762 of November 30, 2011

World AIDS Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On World AIDS Day, 30 years after the first cases of HIV/AIDS were 
reported, we stand with the individuals and communities affected by HIV 
and recommit to progress toward an AIDS-free generation.
My Administration is taking action to turn the corner on the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic by investing in research that promises new and proven methods 
to prevent infection and better therapies for people living with HIV. In 
the past year, the National Institutes of Health has reported important 
progress. We now know that treatment of HIV not only improves clinical 
outcomes, but can also dramatically reduce the risk of transmission. 
Studies on the use of antiretroviral medications to prevent infection of 
HIV-negative individuals show promising results. And research is ongoing 
to devise new prevention methods that may one day offer innovative ways 
to prevent the spread of HIV, like microbicides that can curb the risk 
of infection in women. By pursuing the next breakthrough treatment in 
the fight against HIV, continuing research to develop a vaccine, and 
incorporating new scientific tools into our programs, we are taking 
important steps toward an AIDS-free generation.
To combat the HIV epidemic in the United States, we are implementing the 
first comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy in our country's history, 
which calls for strong, coordinated policy initiatives, enhanced HIV/
AIDS education, collaboration across the Federal Government, and robust 
engagement with individuals, communities, and businesses across America. 
As part of these efforts, we are embracing the best science available to 
prevent new HIV infections, and we are testing new approaches to 
integrating housing, prevention, care, and substance abuse and mental 
health services related to HIV/AIDS. We are implementing the Affordable 
Care Act, which mandates new consumer protections and new options for 
purchasing health

[[Page 193]]

insurance for all Americans by 2014, including those with HIV. We are 
also striving to secure employment opportunities for people living with 
HIV by working to end discrimination based on HIV status.
To address the global HIV pandemic, we are working with nations around 
the world to advance comprehensive prevention efforts and provide 
lifesaving medicine to millions of people living with HIV. We are 
integrating cutting-edge science into the President's Emergency Plan for 
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) that will do even more to prevent new HIV 
infections, including more effective drug regimens to prevent mother-to-
child HIV transmission and low-cost approaches like voluntary medical 
male circumcision. When combined with other proven approaches, such as 
condoms, HIV testing and counseling, and programs to support behavior 
change, these advances can dramatically reduce HIV incidence and save 
lives. As we move forward, we will maintain our commitment to rigorously 
measuring the impact of these approaches, revising them appropriately, 
and incorporating new ideas and technologies as they become available.
Recognizing that a coordinated strategy is essential to our success, we 
are partnering with a wide variety of stakeholders to promote HIV/AIDS 
awareness, prevention, and treatment. Here at home, States, tribes, 
territories, and local governments are vital partners in implementing 
the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and we are joined by a host of public 
and private supporters and collaborators in PEPFAR. Partnerships with 
corporations, foundations, faith-based institutions, academic 
institutions, and other organizations are critically important to the 
fight against HIV, and we will work to strengthen these ties in the 
years ahead.
At this pivotal time in the worldwide response to HIV, the United States 
is preparing to welcome the global community to Washington, D.C., for 
the 19th International AIDS Conference in July 2012. We look forward to 
working with and learning from people living with HIV, clinicians, 
researchers, practitioners, and advocates from across the globe. On this 
World AIDS Day, let us reflect on the people we have lost and those we 
hold dear who are living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. And as we pay 
tribute to the past and current heroes in the struggle against this 
disease, let us recommit to bringing an end to this tragic pandemic and 
pursuing an AIDS-free generation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim December 1, 2011, as 
World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to 
AIDS and to provide support and comfort to those living with this 
disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8763 of December 2, 2011

International Day of Persons With Disabilities, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we recommit to 
ensuring people living with disabilities enjoy full equality and 
unhindered participation in all facets of our national life. We 
recognize the myriad contributions that persons with disabilities make 
at home and abroad, and we remember that disability rights are universal 
rights to be recognized and promoted around the world.
For decades, America has been a global leader in advancing the rights of 
people with disabilities. From the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 to the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility 
Act, which I signed last year, we have striven to bring the American 
dream and comprehensive opportunities in education, health care, and 
employment within reach for every individual. These actions--made 
possible only through the tireless and ongoing efforts of the disability 
community--affirm our commitment to an equitable and just society where 
every American can play a part in securing a prosperous future for our 
Nation.
To fulfill this promise not only in America, but around the world, my 
Administration is putting disability rights at the heart of our Nation's 
foreign policy. With leadership from the Department of State and the 
United States Agency for International Development, we are collaborating 
across governments and in close consultation with the global disability 
community to expand access to education, health care, HIV/AIDS 
prevention and treatment, and other development programs. In 2009, we 
signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which 
seeks to ensure persons with disabilities enjoy the same rights and 
opportunities as all people. If ratified, the Convention would provide a 
platform to encourage other countries to join and implement the 
Convention, laying a foundation for enhanced benefits and greater 
protections for the millions of Americans with disabilities who spend 
time abroad.
We know from the historic struggle for disability rights in the United 
States that disability inclusion is an ongoing effort, and many 
challenges remain in securing fundamental human rights for all persons 
with disabilities around the world. On International Day of Persons with 
Disabilities, we press forward, renewing our dedication to embrace 
diversity, end discrimination, remove barriers, and uphold the rights, 
dignity, and equal opportunity of all people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2011, as 
International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I call on all Americans 
to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

Proclamation 8764 of December 6, 2011

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On a serene Sunday morning 70 years ago, the skies above Pearl Harbor 
were darkened by the bombs of Japanese forces in a surprise attack that 
tested the resilience of our Armed Forces and the will of our Nation. As 
explosions sounded and battleships burned, brave service members fought 
back fiercely with everything they could find. Unbeknownst to these 
selfless individuals, the sacrifices endured on that infamous day would 
galvanize America and come to symbolize the mettle of a generation.
In the wake of the bombing of our harbor and the crippling of our 
Pacific Fleet, there were those who declared the United States had been 
reduced to a third-class power. But rather than break the spirit of our 
Nation, the attack brought Americans together and fortified our resolve. 
Patriots across our country answered the call to defend our way of life 
at home and abroad. They crossed oceans and stormed beaches, freeing 
millions from the grip of tyranny and proving that our military is the 
greatest force for liberty and security the world has ever known. On the 
home front, dedicated civilians supported the war effort by repairing 
wrecked battleships, working in factories, and joining civilian defense 
organizations to help with salvage programs and plant Victory gardens. 
At this time of great strife, we reminded the world there is no 
challenge we cannot meet; there is no challenge we cannot overcome.
On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we honor the more than 3,500 
Americans killed or wounded during that deadly attack and pay tribute to 
the heroes whose courage ensured our Nation would recover from this 
vicious blow. Their tenacity helped define the Greatest Generation and 
their valor fortified all who served during World War II. As a Nation, 
we look to December 7, 1941, to draw strength from the example set by 
these patriots and to honor all who have sacrificed for our freedoms.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2011, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of 
remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and 
interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the 
United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of those American 
patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.

December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8765 of December 8, 2011

Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

With the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 
December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed the 
eternal truths that all people have the right to liberty, equality, and 
justice under the law. On Human Rights Day and during Human Rights Week, 
we celebrate our fundamental freedoms and renew our commitment to 
upholding and advancing human dignity.
The human race reflects a myriad of vibrant cultures and unique 
identities, yet we are united by the innate liberties that are our 
common birthright. The rights to assemble peacefully, to speak and 
worship as we please, and to determine our own destinies know no 
borders. All people should live free from the threat of extrajudicial 
killing, torture, oppression, and discrimination, regardless of gender, 
race, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or physical or mental 
disability.
Dictators seek to constrain these liberties through repressive laws and 
blunt force, but hope cannot be imprisoned and aspirations cannot be 
killed. We are reminded of this when demonstrators brave bullets and 
batons to sound the call for reform, when young women dare to go to 
school despite prohibitions, and when same-sex couples refuse to be told 
whom to love. The past year saw extraordinary change in the Middle East 
and North Africa as square by square, town by town, country by country, 
people rose up to demand their human rights. Around the world, we 
witnessed significant progress in consolidating democracy and expanding 
freedoms, often facilitated by critical assistance from the 
international community.
In the 63 years since the global community came together in support of 
human dignity and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, our 
futures have grown increasingly interconnected. We have a stake not only 
in the stability of nations, but also in the welfare of individuals. On 
this anniversary, we recognize human rights as universal, and we stand 
with all those who reach for the dream of a free, just, and equal world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2011, as 
Human Rights Day and the week beginning December 10, 2011, as Human 
Rights Week. I call upon the people of the United States to mark these 
observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 8766 of December 8, 2011

Bill of Rights Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On December 15, 1791, the United States adopted the Bill of Rights, 
enshrining in our Constitution the protection of our inalienable 
freedoms, from the right to speak our minds and worship as we please to 
the guarantee of equal justice under the law. For 220 years, these 
fundamental liberties have shaped our national character and stirred the 
souls of all who dream of a freer, more just world. As we mark this 
milestone, we renew our commitment to preserving our universal rights 
and perfecting our Union.
Introduced in the First Congress in 1789, the Bill of Rights was born 
out of compromise. The promise of enumerated rights enabled the 
ratification of the Constitution without fear that a more centralized 
government would encroach on American freedoms. In adopting the first 
ten Amendments, our Founders put forth an ideal that continues to define 
our Nation--that we can have both liberty and security, that we need not 
sacrifice the rights of man for the rule of law.
Throughout our country's history, generations have risen to uphold the 
principles outlined in our Bill of Rights and advance equality for all 
Americans. The liberties we enjoy today are possible only because of 
these brave patriots, from the service members who have defended our 
freedom to the citizens who have braved billy clubs and fire hoses in 
the hope of extending America's promise across lines of color and creed. 
On Bill of Rights Day, we celebrate this proud legacy and resolve to 
pass to our children an America worthy of our Founders' vision.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 15, 2011, as 
Bill of Rights Day. I call upon the people of the United States to mark 
this observance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8767 of December 15, 2011

Wright Brothers Day, 2011

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On a blustery December morning in 1903, two brothers from Dayton, Ohio, 
successfully piloted the world's first powered flying machine and 
ascended from the steady currents of North Carolina's Outer Banks into 
the heights of our collective memory. During the 12 seconds their 
aircraft remained aloft in Kitty Hawk's gusty headwinds, Wilbur and 
Orville Wright sparked a transportation revolution and fulfilled a dream 
shared across cultures since time immemorial. Today, we commemorate 
their extraordinary feat and celebrate the spirit of American innovation 
that propels our Nation toward bold new horizons.
Fashioned from wood and cloth and powered by a four-cylinder engine they 
designed themselves, the Wright brothers' Flyer I was the culmination of 
years of painstaking research and unyielding perseverance. They financed 
countless experiments with earnings from their bicycle shop, gathering 
data on wing shape using a home-built wind tunnel and developing the 
basic controls for pitch, roll, and yaw that, to this day, guide our 
jetliners to every corner of the world and our spacecraft to the 
farthest reaches of the Solar System. The technical obstacles they 
overcame were tremendous, and Orville and Wilbur Wright's pioneering 
vision stands as a testament to the will and determination that fuels 
innovators, inventors, scientists, and entrepreneurs across our 
country--from home workbenches to national laboratories.
As we pursue progress and prosperity in the 21st century, we remember 
the key to our success has always been our unparalleled ability to think 
up new ideas, create new industries, and lead the way in discovery and 
innovation--just as it was for the Wright brothers over a century ago. 
To reaffirm our role as the engine that drives science and technology 
around the world, we must empower our Nation's youth with a competitive 
education and the tools to make tomorrow's breakthrough discoveries.
On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright helped inspire a century 
of progress and groundbreaking ideas when they guided a small wooden 
aircraft above the sands of Kitty Hawk and onto the ocean breeze. Even 
after this monumental achievement, the brothers continued to push the 
boundaries of flight and possibility, rapidly advancing the field of 
aeronautics and our burgeoning aviation industry. They inspired other 
early aviators, including Calbraith Perry Rodgers, who flew a Wright 
airplane to complete the first transcontinental flight 100 years ago, 
and Harriet Quimby, who became our Nation's first female licensed pilot 
and a groundbreaking aviator. So, too, must we press onward, exploring 
new frontiers of science, technology, and imagination in pursuit of a 
brighter future for generations to come. The Wright brothers stand among 
America's most celebrated innovators, and today, we recognize all those 
who look toward the heavens and envision what might be.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as 
amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of 
each year

[[Page 199]]

as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested the 
President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the 
United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2011, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8768 of December 28, 2011

National Mentoring Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, mentors help young Americans face the challenges of growing 
into adulthood. By setting a positive example and sharing their time, 
knowledge, and experience, mentors play an essential role in preparing 
our Nation's youth for a bright future. During National Mentoring Month, 
we celebrate the contributions of all those who cultivate a supportive 
environment for the next generation, and we recommit to expanding 
mentorship opportunities across our country.
At school and at home, in the library and on the field, mentors lift our 
youth toward their goals and ambitions. As a teacher, a relative, or a 
trusted friend, a mentor's steady and dependable support can inspire a 
child to strive for success and instill in them the confidence to 
achieve their full potential. Mentorship strengthens our American 
family, and by teaching enduring values like diligence and self-
discipline, we make a powerful and lasting investment in our youth, our 
communities, and our Nation.
Across the Federal Government, we are working to ensure more young 
people have the opportunity to connect with a mentor. Last January, we 
partnered with businesses across America to launch the Corporate 
Mentoring Challenge, which calls on corporations to begin or expand 
mentoring programs that pair children with positive role models, foster 
leadership skills, and put them on the path to success in school and 
beyond. As part of our steadfast commitment to support our service 
members and their loved ones, we are funding new mentorship 
opportunities for children from military families. And we are continuing 
to engage faith and community groups to help recruit mentors who can 
guide our youth in education, employment, and engaged citizenship. For 
information and resources about mentoring opportunities, I encourage all 
Americans to visit: www.Serve.gov/Mentor.
By lending a hand and serving as a mentor, countless individuals have 
empowered young Americans with the confidence, inspiration, and tools to 
lead rich and fulfilling lives. This month, I encourage adults to make 
an investment in our Nation's future by helping a child discover the 
best in themselves.

[[Page 200]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2012 as 
National Mentoring Month. I call upon public officials, business and 
community leaders, educators, and Americans across the country to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

Proclamation 8769 of December 28, 2011

National Stalking Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In our schools and in our neighborhoods, at home and in workplaces 
across our Nation, stalking endangers the physical and emotional well-
being of millions of American men and women every year. Too often, 
stalking goes unreported and unaddressed, and we must take action 
against this unacceptable abuse. This month, we stand with all those who 
have been affected by stalking and strengthen our resolve to prevent 
this crime before it occurs.
Stalkers inspire fear through intimidation, explicit or implied threats, 
and nonconsensual communication--often by telephone, text message, or 
email--that can cause severe emotional and physical distress. Many 
victims suffer anxiety attacks, feelings of anger or helplessness, and 
depression. Fearing for their safety, some are forced to relocate or 
change jobs to protect themselves. And, tragically, stalking can be a 
precursor to more violent offenses, including sexual assault and 
homicide. The consequences of this crime are real, and they take a 
profound and ongoing toll on men, women, teens, and children across our 
country.
Despite the dangerous reality of stalking, public awareness and legal 
responses to this crime remain limited. New data show that one in six 
women and one in 19 men have experienced stalking that caused them to be 
very fearful or feel that they or someone close to them were in 
immediate physical danger. Among men and women alike, victims are most 
commonly stalked by current or former intimate partners, and young 
adults are at the highest risk for stalking victimization. Though 
stalking can occur in any community, shame, fear of retribution, or 
concerns that they will not be supported lead many victims to forego 
reporting the crime to the police. As we strive to reverse this trend, 
we must do more to promote public awareness and support for survivors of 
stalking.
My Administration is working to advance protection and services for 
stalking victims, empower survivors to break the cycle of abuse, and 
bring an end to violence against women and men. With unprecedented 
coordination

[[Page 201]]

between Federal agencies, we are promoting new tools to decrease the 
incidence of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and 
stalking, and we are taking action to ensure perpetrators are held 
accountable. To reinforce these efforts, advocates, law enforcement 
officials, and others who work with victims must continue to improve 
their capacity to respond with swift and comprehensive action. From 
raising awareness to pursuing criminal justice, all of us have a role to 
play in stopping this senseless and harmful behavior.
This month, let us come together to prevent abuse, violence, and 
harassment in all their forms and renew our commitment to bring care and 
support to those in need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2012 as 
National Stalking Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to learn to 
recognize the signs of stalking, acknowledge stalking as a serious 
crime, and urge those impacted not to be afraid to speak out or ask for 
help. Let us also resolve to support victims and survivors, and to 
create communities that are secure and supportive for all Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8770 of December 29, 2011

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to section 503(b)(1)(G) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
(the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2463(b)(1)(G)), articles that the 
President determines to be import-sensitive in the context of the 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) are not eligible to receive 
benefits under the GSP.
2. Pursuant to section 503(b)(1)(G) of the 1974 Act, and after receiving 
advice from the United States International Trade Commission (the 
``Commission''), I have determined that certain articles are import-
sensitive in the context of the GSP.
3. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the 
Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel 
(USIFTA), which the Congress approved in the United States-Israel Free 
Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``USIFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2112 note).
4. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President 
determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of 
reciprocal

[[Page 202]]

and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided 
for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, 
suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such 
continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such 
additional duties as the President determines to be required or 
appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.
5. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, 
on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with 
Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products 
during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the ``2004 
Agreement'').
6. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 
Agreement, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the 
USIFTA Act, that it was necessary in order to maintain the general level 
of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to 
Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the 
United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of 
certain agricultural products of Israel.
7. In 2008, 2009, and 2010, the United States and Israel entered into 
agreements to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement was in force for 
1-year periods to allow additional time for the two governments to 
conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.
8. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamation 
8334 of December 31, 2008; Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009; and 
Proclamation 8618 of December 21, 2010, modified the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule (HTS) of the United States to provide duty-free access into the 
United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products 
of Israel, each time for an additional 1-year period.
9. On December 6, 2011, the United States entered into an agreement with 
Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through 
December 31, 2012, to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to 
replace the 2004 Agreement.
10. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that 
it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal 
and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided 
for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States 
through the close of December 31, 2012, for specified quantities of 
certain agricultural products of Israel.
11. In Proclamation 8742 of October 31, 2011, I modified the HTS to 
promote the uniform application of the International Convention on the 
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System and to alleviate 
unnecessary administrative burdens. Those modifications became effective 
on December 3, 2011. Certain conforming changes to the HTS were 
inadvertently omitted from Annex I to that proclamation. I have 
determined that certain technical corrections to the HTS are necessary 
to provide the tariff treatment intended to certain products that were 
subject to the modifications made in Proclamation 8742.
12. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions 
of that Act,

[[Page 203]]

and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, 
including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any 
rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, and section 4 of the USIFTA 
Act, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to provide that one or more articles should no longer be 
treated as eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 
1-Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheading is modified as 
set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.
(2) The modification to the HTS set forth in Annex I to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2012.
(3) In order to implement U.S. tariff commitments under the 2004 
Agreement through December 31, 2012, the HTS is modified as provided in 
Annex II to this proclamation.
(4)(a) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex II to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to eligible agricultural 
products of Israel that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after January 1, 2012.
    (b) The provisions of subchapter VIII of chapter 99 of the HTS, as 
modified by Annex II to this proclamation, shall continue in effect 
through December 31, 2012.
(5) In order to make the technical corrections necessary to provide the 
tariff treatment intended to certain footwear products, the HTS is 
modified as set forth in Annex III to this proclamation.
(6) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex III to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods that are entered, 
or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after December 3, 
2011.
(7) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day 
of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011

To Modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and for 
Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 
(the ``1988 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States 
International Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') to keep the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous 
review and periodically to recommend to the President such modifications 
to the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to 
accomplish the purposes set forth in that subsection. The Commission has 
recommended modifications to the HTS pursuant to sections 1205(c) and 
(d) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(c) and (d)) to conform the HTS to 
amendments made to the International Convention on the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System (the ``Convention'').
2. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the 
President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the 
recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act, if 
he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United 
States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the 
national economic interest of the United States. I have determined that 
the modifications to the HTS proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to 
section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are in conformity with United States 
obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national 
economic interest of the United States.
3. Presidential Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented with 
respect to the United States, the trade agreements resulting from the 
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including Schedule XX-
United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Schedule XX), that were 
entered into pursuant to sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)), and approved in section 101(a) of the Uruguay 
Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3511(a)).

U.S.C. 3521) and sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act, Proclamation 
6763 included the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President 
determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms of 
Schedule XX. In order to ensure the continuation of such rates of duty 
for imported goods under tariff categories that are being modified to 
reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that 
additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to 
carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed, including certain 
technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.
5. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to

proclaimed.

the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for 
originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to

Proclamation 8772 of December 30, 2011

National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Nearly a century and a half ago, President Abraham Lincoln issued the 
Emancipation Proclamation--a document that reaffirmed the noble goals of 
equality and freedom for all that lie at the heart of what it means to 
live in America. In the years since, we have tirelessly pursued the 
realization and protection of these essential principles. Yet, despite 
our successes, thousands of individuals living in the United States and 
still more abroad suffer in silence under the intolerable yoke of modern 
slavery. During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 
we stand with all those who are held in compelled service; we recognize 
the people, organizations, and government entities that are working to 
combat human trafficking; and we recommit to bringing an end to this 
inexcusable human rights abuse.
Human trafficking endangers the lives of millions of people around the 
world, and it is a crime that knows no borders. Trafficking networks 
operate both domestically and transnationally, and although abuses 
disproportionally affect women and girls, the victims of this ongoing 
global tragedy are men, women, and children of all ages. Around the 
world, we are monitoring the progress of governments in combating 
trafficking while supporting programs aimed at its eradication. From 
forced labor and debt bondage to forced commercial sexual exploitation 
and involuntary domestic servitude, human trafficking leaves no country 
untouched. With this knowledge, we rededicate ourselves to forging 
robust international partnerships that strengthen global anti-
trafficking efforts, and to confronting traffickers here at home.
My Administration continues to implement our comprehensive strategy to 
combat human trafficking in America. By coordinating our response across 
Federal agencies, we are working to protect victims of human trafficking 
with effective services and support, prosecute traffickers through 
consistent enforcement, and prevent human rights abuses by furthering 
public awareness and addressing the root causes of modern slavery. The 
steadfast defense of human rights is an essential part of our national 
identity, and as

[[Page 214]]

long as individuals suffer the violence of slavery and human 
trafficking, we must continue the fight.
With the start of each year, we commemorate the anniversaries of the 
Emancipation Proclamation, which became effective on January 1, 1863, 
and the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery, which was signed by President 
Abraham Lincoln and submitted to the States for ratification on February 
1, 1865. These documents stand as testaments to the gains we have made 
in pursuit of freedom and justice for all, and they remind us of the 
work that remains to be done. This month, I urge all Americans to 
educate themselves about all forms of modern slavery and the signs and 
consequences of human trafficking. Together, and in cooperation with our 
partners around the world, we can work to end this terrible injustice 
and protect the rights to life and liberty entrusted to us by our 
forebears and owed to our children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2012 as 
National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in 
the annual celebration of National Freedom Day on February 1. I call 
upon the people of the United States to recognize the vital role we can 
play in ending modern slavery and to observe this month with appropriate 
programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

                            EXECUTIVE ORDERS


________________________________________________________________________


Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011

Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve regulation 
and regulatory review, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. General Principles of Regulation. (a) Our regulatory system 
must protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment while 
promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job 
creation. It must be based on the best available science. It must allow 
for public participation and an open exchange of ideas. It must promote 
predictability and reduce uncertainty. It must identify and use the 
best, most innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving 
regulatory ends. It must take into account benefits and costs, both 
quantitative and qualitative. It must ensure that regulations are 
accessible, consistent, written in plain language, and easy to 
understand. It must measure, and seek to improve, the actual results of 
regulatory requirements.
    (b) This order is supplemental to and reaffirms the principles, 
structures, and definitions governing contemporary regulatory review 
that were established in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993. As 
stated in that Executive Order and to the extent permitted by law, each 
agency must, among other things: (1) propose or adopt a regulation only 
upon a reasoned determination that its benefits justify its costs 
(recognizing that some benefits and costs are difficult to quantify); 
(2) tailor its regulations to impose the least burden on society, 
consistent with obtaining regulatory objectives, taking into account, 
among other things, and to the extent practicable, the costs of 
cumulative regulations; (3) select, in choosing among alternative 
regulatory approaches, those approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, 
and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity); (4) to the 
extent feasible, specify performance objectives, rather than specifying 
the behavior or manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt; 
and (5) identify and assess available alternatives to direct regulation, 
including providing economic incentives to encourage the desired 
behavior, such as user fees or marketable permits, or providing 
information upon which choices can be made by the public.

[[Page 216]]

    (c) In applying these principles, each agency is directed to use the 
best available techniques to quantify anticipated present and future 
benefits and costs as accurately as possible. Where appropriate and 
permitted by law, each agency may consider (and discuss qualitatively) 
values that are difficult or impossible to quantify, including equity, 
human dignity, fairness, and distributive impacts.
Sec. 2. Public Participation. (a) Regulations shall be adopted through a 
process that involves public participation. To that end, regulations 
shall be based, to the extent feasible and consistent with law, on the 
open exchange of information and perspectives among State, local, and 
tribal officials, experts in relevant disciplines, affected stakeholders 
in the private sector, and the public as a whole.
    (b) To promote that open exchange, each agency, consistent with 
Executive Order 12866 and other applicable legal requirements, shall 
endeavor to provide the public with an opportunity to participate in the 
regulatory process. To the extent feasible and permitted by law, each 
agency shall afford the public a meaningful opportunity to comment 
through the Internet on any proposed regulation, with a comment period 
that should generally be at least 60 days. To the extent feasible and 
permitted by law, each agency shall also provide, for both proposed and 
final rules, timely online access to the rulemaking docket on 
regulations.gov, including relevant scientific and technical findings, 
in an open format that can be easily searched and downloaded. For 
proposed rules, such access shall include, to the extent feasible and 
permitted by law, an opportunity for public comment on all pertinent 
parts of the rulemaking docket, including relevant scientific and 
technical findings.
    (c) Before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, each agency, 
where feasible and appropriate, shall seek the views of those who are 
likely to be affected, including those who are likely to benefit from 
and those who are potentially subject to such rulemaking.
Sec. 3. Integration and Innovation. Some sectors and industries face a 
significant number of regulatory requirements, some of which may be 
redundant, inconsistent, or overlapping. Greater coordination across 
agencies could reduce these requirements, thus reducing costs and 
simplifying and harmonizing rules. In developing regulatory actions and 
identifying appropriate approaches, each agency shall attempt to promote 
such coordination, simplification, and harmonization. Each agency shall 
also seek to identify, as appropriate, means to achieve regulatory goals 
that are designed to promote innovation.
Sec. 4. Flexible Approaches. Where relevant, feasible, and consistent 
with regulatory objectives, and to the extent permitted by law, each 
agency shall identify and consider regulatory approaches that reduce 
burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of choice for the public. 
These approaches include warnings, appropriate default rules, and 
disclosure requirements as well as provision of information to the 
public in a form that is clear and intelligible.
Sec. 5. Science. Consistent with the President's Memorandum for the 
Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, ``Scientific Integrity'' 
(March 9, 2009), and its implementing guidance, each agency shall ensure 
the objectivity of any scientific and technological information and 
processes used to support the agency's regulatory actions.

[[Page 217]]

Sec. 6. Retrospective Analyses of Existing Rules. (a) To facilitate the 
periodic review of existing significant regulations, agencies shall 
consider how best to promote retrospective analysis of rules that may be 
outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to 
modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them in accordance with what has 
been learned. Such retrospective analyses, including supporting data, 
should be released online whenever possible.
    (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each agency shall 
develop and submit to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs a 
preliminary plan, consistent with law and its resources and regulatory 
priorities, under which the agency will periodically review its existing 
significant regulations to determine whether any such regulations should 
be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the 
agency's regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in 
achieving the regulatory objectives.
Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) For purposes of this order, ``agency'' 
shall have the meaning set forth in section 3(b) of Executive Order 
12866.
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

    February 8, 2011.
Executive Order 13566 of February 25, 2011

Blocking Property and Prohibiting Certain Transactions Related to Libya

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that 
Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates have taken 
extreme measures against the people of Libya, including by using weapons 
of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed civilians. I 
further find that there is a serious risk that Libyan state assets will 
be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his government, members of his 
family, or his close associates if those assets are not protected. The 
foregoing circumstances, the prolonged attacks, and the increased 
numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other countries from the attacks, 
have caused a deterioration in the security of Libya and pose a serious 
risk to its stability, thereby constituting an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, 
and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.
I hereby order:
Section 1. All property and interests in property that are in the United 
States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:

[[Page 223]]

    (a) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
    (b) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

(i) to be a senior official of the Government of Libya;

(ii) to be a child of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi;

(iii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, 
controlling, or otherwise directing, or to have participated in, the 
commission of human rights abuses related to political repression in Libya;

(iv) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in 
support of the activities described in subsection (b)(iii) of this section 
or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to this order;

(v) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for 
or on behalf of, any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order; or

(vi) to be a spouse or dependent child of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

Sec. 2. All property and interests in property that are in the United 
States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any overseas branch, of the Government of Libya, its 
agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities, and the Central 
Bank of Libya, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.
Sec. 3. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, 
there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made 
pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 4. I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of 
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the 
type of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of 
any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant 
to sections 1 and 2 of this order would seriously impair my ability to 
deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby 
prohibit such donations as provided by sections 1 and 2 of this order.
Sec. 5. The prohibitions in sections 1 and 2 of this order include but 
are not limited to:
    (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.

[[Page 224]]

Sec. 6. The prohibitions in sections 1 and 2 of this order apply except 
to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 7. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 8. Nothing in this order shall prohibit transactions for the 
conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by employees,

Executive Order 13567 of March 7, 2011

Periodic Review of Individuals Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station 
Pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Authorization for 
Use of Military Force of September 2001 (AUMF), Public Law 107-40, and 
in order to ensure that military detention of individuals now held at 
the U.S. Naval Station, Guant[aacute]namo Bay, Cuba (Guant[aacute]namo), 
who were subject to the interagency review under section 4 of Executive 
Order 13492 of January 22, 2009, continues to be carefully evaluated and 
justified, consistent with the national security and foreign policy 
interests of the United States and the interests of justice, I hereby 
order as follows:
Section 1. Scope and Purpose. (a) The periodic review described in 
section 3 of this order applies only to those detainees held at 
Guant[aacute]namo on the date of this order, whom the interagency review 
established by Executive Order 13492 has (i) designated for continued 
law of war detention; or (ii) referred for prosecution, except for those 
detainees against whom charges are pending or a judgment of conviction 
has been entered.
    (b) This order is intended solely to establish, as a discretionary 
matter, a process to review on a periodic basis the executive branch's 
continued, discretionary exercise of existing detention authority in 
individual cases. It does not create any additional or separate source 
of detention authority, and it does not affect the scope of detention 
authority under existing law. Detainees at Guant[aacute]namo have the 
constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and nothing in 
this order is intended to affect the jurisdiction of Federal courts to 
determine the legality of their detention.
    (c) In the event detainees covered by this order are transferred 
from Guant[aacute]namo to another U.S. detention facility where they 
remain in law of war detention, this order shall continue to apply to 
them.
Sec. 2. Standard for Continued Detention. Continued law of war detention 
is warranted for a detainee subject to the periodic review in section 3 
of this order if it is necessary to protect against a significant threat 
to the security of the United States.
Sec. 3. Periodic Review. The Secretary of Defense shall coordinate a 
process of periodic review of continued law of war detention for each 
detainee described in section 1(a) of this order. In consultation with 
the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense shall issue implementing 
guidelines governing the process, consistent with the following 
requirements:
    (a) Initial Review. For each detainee, an initial review shall 
commence as soon as possible but no later than 1 year from the date of 
this order. The initial review will consist of a hearing before a 
Periodic Review Board (PRB). The review and hearing shall follow a 
process that includes the following requirements:

(1) Each detainee shall be provided, in writing and in a language the 
detainee understands, with advance notice of the PRB review and an 
unclassified summary of the factors and information the PRB will consider

[[Page 228]]

in evaluating whether the detainee meets the standard set forth in section 
2 of this order. The written summary shall be sufficiently comprehensive to 
provide adequate notice to the detainee of the reasons for continued 
detention.

(2) The detainee shall be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by a 
Government-provided personal representative (representative) who possesses 
the security clearances necessary for access to the information described 
in subsection (a)(4) of this section. The representative shall advocate on 
behalf of the detainee before the PRB and shall be responsible for 
challenging the Government's information and introducing information on 
behalf of the detainee. In addition to the representative, the detainee may 
be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by private counsel, at no expense 
to the Government.

(3) The detainee shall be permitted to (i) present to the PRB a written or 
oral statement; (ii) introduce relevant information, including written 
declarations; (iii) answer any questions posed by the PRB; and (iv) call 
witnesses who are reasonably available and willing to provide information 
that is relevant and material to the standard set forth in section 2 of 
this order.

(4) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant 
Government agencies, shall compile and provide to the PRB all information 
in the detainee disposition recommendations produced by the Task Force 
established under Executive Order 13492 that is relevant to the 
determination whether the standard in section 2 of this order has been met 
and on which the Government seeks to rely for that determination. In 
addition, the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant 
Government agencies, shall compile any additional information relevant to 
that determination, and on which the Government seeks to rely for that 
determination, that has become available since the conclusion of the 
Executive Order 13492 review. All mitigating information relevant to that 
determination must be provided to the PRB.

(5) The information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be 
provided to the detainee's representative. In exceptional circumstances 
where it is necessary to protect national security, including intelligence 
sources and methods, the PRB may determine that the representative must 
receive a sufficient substitute or summary, rather than the underlying 
information. If the detainee is represented by private counsel, the 
information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be provided 
to such counsel unless the Government determines that the need to protect 
national security, including intelligence sources and methods, or law 
enforcement or privilege concerns, requires the Government to provide 
counsel with a sufficient substitute or summary of the information. A 
sufficient substitute or summary must provide a meaningful opportunity to 
assist the detainee during the review process.

(6) The PRB shall conduct a hearing to consider the information described 
in subsection (a)(4) of this section, and other relevant information 
provided by the detainee or the detainee's representative or counsel, to 
determine whether the standard in section 2 of this order is met. The PRB 
shall consider the reliability of any information provided to it in making 
its determination.

[[Page 229]]

(7) The PRB shall make a prompt determination, by consensus and in writing, 
as to whether the detainee's continued detention is warranted under the 
standard in section 2 of this order. If the PRB determines that the 
standard is not met, the PRB shall also recommend any conditions that 
relate to the detainee's transfer. The PRB shall provide a written summary 
of any final determination in unclassified form to the detainee, in a 
language the detainee understands, within 30 days of the determination when 
practicable.

(8) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a secretariat to administer 
the PRB review and hearing process. The Director of National Intelligence 
shall assist in preparing the unclassified notice and the substitutes or 
summaries described above. Other executive departments and agencies shall 
assist in the process of providing the PRB with information required for 
the review processes detailed in this order.

    (b) Subsequent Full Review. The continued detention of each detainee 
shall be subject to subsequent full reviews and hearings by the PRB on a 
triennial basis. Each subsequent review shall employ the procedures set 
forth in section 3(a) of this order.
    (c) File Reviews. The continued detention of each detainee shall 
also be subject to a file review every 6 months in the intervening years 
between full reviews. This file review will be conducted by the PRB and 
shall consist of a review of any relevant new information related to the 
detainee compiled by the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with 
other relevant agencies, since the last review and, as appropriate, 
information considered during any prior PRB review. The detainee shall 
be permitted to make a written submission in connection with each file 
review. If, during the file review, a significant question is raised as 
to whether the detainee's continued detention is warranted under the 
standard in section 2 of this order, the PRB will promptly convene a 
full review pursuant to the standards in section 3(a) of this order.
    (d) Review of PRB Determinations. The Review Committee (Committee), 
as defined in section 9(d) of this order, shall conduct a review if (i) 
a member of the Committee seeks review of a PRB determination within 30 
days of that determination; or (ii) consensus within the PRB cannot be 
reached.
Sec. 4. Effect of Determination to Transfer. (a) If a final 
determination is made that a detainee does not meet the standard in 
section 2 of this order, the Secretaries of State and Defense shall be 
responsible for ensuring that vigorous efforts are undertaken to 
identify a suitable transfer location for any such detainee, outside of 
the United States, consistent with the national security and foreign 
policy interests of the United States and the commitment set forth in 
section 2242(a) of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 
1998 (Public Law 105-277).
    (b) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Defense, shall be responsible for obtaining appropriate security and 
humane treatment assurances regarding any detainee to be transferred to 
another country, and for determining, after consultation with members of 
the Committee, that it is appropriate to proceed with the transfer.
    (c) The Secretary of State shall evaluate humane treatment 
assurances in all cases, consistent with the recommendations of the 
Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies established by 
Executive Order 13491 of January 22, 2009.

[[Page 230]]

Sec. 5. Annual Committee Review. (a) The Committee shall conduct an 
annual review of sufficiency and efficacy of transfer efforts, 
including:

(1) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee who has been subject to 
the periodic review under section 3 of this order, whose continued 
detention has been determined not to be warranted, and who has not been 
transferred more than 6 months after the date of such determination;

(2) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee whose petition for a 
writ of habeas corpus has been granted by a U.S. Federal court with no 
pending appeal and who has not been transferred;

(3) the status of transfer efforts for any detainee who has been designated 
for transfer or conditional detention by the Executive Order 13492 review 
and who has not been transferred; and

(4) the security and other conditions in the countries to which detainees 
might be transferred, including a review of any suspension of transfers to 
a particular country, in order to determine whether further steps to 
facilitate transfers are appropriate or to provide a recommendation to the 
President regarding whether continuation of any such suspension is 
warranted.

    (b) After completion of the initial reviews under section 3(a) of 
this order, and at least once every 4 years thereafter, the Committee 
shall review whether a continued law of war detention policy remains 
consistent with the interests of the United States, including national 
security interests.
Sec. 6. Continuing Obligation of the Departments of Justice and Defense 
to Assess Feasibility of Prosecution. As to each detainee whom the 
interagency review established by Executive Order 13492 has designated 
for continued law of war detention, the Attorney General and the 
Secretary of Defense shall continue to assess whether prosecution of the 
detainee is feasible and in the national security interests of the 
United States, and shall refer detainees for prosecution, as 
appropriate.
Sec. 7. Obligation of Other Departments and Agencies to Assist the 
Secretary of Defense. All departments, agencies, entities, and officers 
of the United States, to the maximum extent permitted by law, shall 
provide the Secretary of Defense such assistance as may be requested to 
implement this order.
Sec. 8. Legality of Detention. The process established under this order 
does not address the legality of any detainee's law of war detention. 
If, at any time during the periodic review process established in this 
order, material information calls into question the legality of 
detention, the matter will be referred immediately to the Secretary of 
Defense and the Attorney General for appropriate action.
Sec. 9. Definitions. (a) ``Law of War Detention'' means: detention 
authorized by the Congress under the AUMF, as informed by the laws of 
war.
    (b) ``Periodic Review Board'' means: a board composed of senior 
officials tasked with fulfilling the functions described in section 3 of

Security, as well as the Offices of the Director of National 
Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

[[Page 231]]

    (c) ``Conditional Detention'' means: the status of those detainees

option becomes available.
    (d) ``Review Committee'' means: a committee composed of the 
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the

determine the disposition of any detainee not covered by this order.
    (b) This order shall be implemented subject to the availability of 
necessary appropriations and consistent with applicable law including: 
the Convention Against Torture; Common Article 3 of the Geneva

Executive Order 13571 of April 27, 2011

Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve the 
quality of service to the public by the Federal Government, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The public deserves competent, efficient, and 
responsive service from the Federal Government. Executive departments 
and agencies (agencies) must continuously evaluate their performance in 
meeting this standard and work to improve it. To this end, Executive 
Order 12862 (Setting Customer Service Standards), issued on September 
11, 1993, requires agencies that provide significant services directly 
to the public to identify and survey their customers, establish service 
standards and track performance against those standards, and benchmark 
customer service performance against the best in business. This effort 
to ``put people first'' was an important step. It was reinforced by a 
Presidential Memorandum for the Heads

[[Page 235]]

of Executive Departments and Agencies issued on March 22, 1995 
(Improving Customer Service), and a further Presidential Memorandum 
issued on March 3, 1998 (Conducting ``Conversations with America'' to 
Further Improve Customer Service).
However, with advances in technology and service delivery systems in 
other sectors, the public's expectations of the Government have 
continued to rise. The Government must keep pace with and even exceed 
those expectations. Government must also address the need to improve its 
services, not only to individuals, but also to private and Governmental 
entities to which the agency directly provides significant services. 
Government managers must learn from what is working in the private 
sector and apply these best practices to deliver services better, 
faster, and at lower cost. Such best practices include increasingly 
popular lower-cost, self-service options accessed by the Internet or 
mobile phone and improved processes that deliver services faster and 
more responsively, reducing the overall need for customer inquiries and 
complaints. The Federal Government has a responsibility to streamline 
and make more efficient its service delivery to better serve the public.
Sec. 2. Agency Customer Service Plans and Activities. Within 180 days of 
the date of this order, each agency shall develop, in consultation with 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a Customer Service Plan 
(plan) to address how the agency will provide services in a manner that 
seeks to streamline service delivery and improve the experience of its 
customers. As used in this order, the term ``customer'' refers to any 
individual or to any entity, including a business, tribal, State or 
local government, or other agency, to which the agency directly provides 
significant services. The plan shall set forth the agency's approach, 
intended benefits, and an implementation timeline for the following 
actions:
    (a) establishing one major initiative (signature initiative) that 
will use technology to improve the customer experience;
    (b) establishing mechanisms to solicit customer feedback on 
Government services and using such feedback regularly to make service 
improvements;
    (c) setting clear customer service standards and expectations, 
including, where appropriate, performance goals for customer service 
required by the GPRA (Government Performance and Results) Modernization 
Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-352);
    (d) improving the customer experience by adopting proven customer 
service best practices and coordinating across service channels (such as 
online, phone, in-person, and mail services);
    (e) streamlining agency processes to reduce costs and accelerate 
delivery, while reducing the need for customer calls and inquiries; and
    (f) identifying ways to use innovative technologies to accomplish 
the customer service activities above, thereby lowering costs, 
decreasing service delivery times, and improving the customer 
experience.
Sec. 3. Publication of Agency Customer Service Plans. Each agency shall 
publish its plan on its Open Government web page.
Sec. 4. Assistance in Implementation. In consultation with the heads of 
executive departments and agencies, the Chief Performance Officer, who 
also serves as the Deputy Director for Management of the OMB, shall 
develop

[[Page 236]]

guidance for implementing the activities outlined in this order. Such 
guidance shall include, among other things, the nature and scope of 
services to which the order's requirements will apply. The Office of 
Management and Budget, the General Services Administration, and the 
Office of Science and Technology Policy shall assist and support 
agencies in developing customer service standards and plans, online 
posting of customer service metrics and best practices, expediting 
review for customer feedback mechanisms under the Paperwork Reduction 
Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), improving the design and management of 
agency websites providing services or information to the public in 
compliance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d), 
and using innovative technologies to improve customer service at lower 
costs.
Sec. 5. Independent Agencies. Independent agencies are requested to 
adhere to this order.
Sec. 6. Privileged Information. Nothing in this order shall compel or 
authorize the disclosure of privileged information, law enforcement 
information, information affecting national security, or information the 
disclosure of which is prohibited by law.
Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011

Blocking Property of Certain Persons With Respect to Human Rights Abuses 
in Syria

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, hereby 
expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order

[[Page 237]]

13338 of May 11, 2004, and relied upon for additional steps taken in 
Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, and in Executive Order 13460 of 
February 13, 2008, finding that the Government of Syria's human rights 
abuses, including those related to the repression of the people of 
Syria, manifested most recently by the use of violence and torture 
against, and arbitrary arrests and detentions of, peaceful protestors by 
police, security forces, and other entities that have engaged in human 
rights abuses, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and 
I hereby order:
Section 1. All property and interests in property that are in the United 
States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:
    (a) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
    (b) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

(i) to be responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, 
controlling, or otherwise directing, or to have participated in, the 
commission of human rights abuses in Syria, including those related to 
repression;

(ii) to be a senior official of an entity whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order;

(iii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, 
the activities described in subsection (b)(i) of this section or any person 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive 
Order 13338, Executive Order 13460, or this order; or

(iv) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for 
or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13460 or this 
order.

Sec. 2. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously 
impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13338 and expanded in this order, and I hereby prohibit 
such donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not 
limited to:
    (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.
Sec. 4. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order apply except to the 
extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or 
licenses

[[Page 238]]

that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any 
contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date of this order.
Sec. 5. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 6. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and
    (d) the term ``Government of Syria'' means the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled 
entities.
Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13338 and expanded in this order, there need be no prior notice of 
a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine that circumstances 
no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property 
of a person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take necessary 
action to give effect to that determination.
Sec. 10. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity 
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

[[Page 239]]

Sec. 11. This order is effective at 1:00 p.m. eastern daylight time on 
April 29, 2011.

[[Page 246]]

    (b) I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of 
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the 
types of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit 
of any ISA-sanctioned person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to subsection (a)(iv) of this section would 
seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared

provided by subsection (a)(iv) of this section.
    (c) The prohibitions in subsection (a)(iv) of this section include

United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the

institution (as defined in section 3(c)(1) of the Federal Deposit

blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence

appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions 
of this order.
Sec. 6. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 7. The measures taken pursuant to this order are in response to 
actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the conclusion of the 
1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those 
later actions.

Executive Order 13576 of June 13, 2011

Delivering an Efficient, Effective, and Accountable Government

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to cut waste, 
streamline Government operations, and reinforce the performance and 
management reform gains my Administration has achieved, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. My Administration is committed to ensuring that the 
Federal Government serves the American people with the utmost 
effectiveness and efficiency. Over the last 2 years, we have made good 
progress and have saved taxpayer dollars by cutting waste and increasing 
the efficiency of Government operations by curbing uncontrolled growth 
in contract spending, terminating poorly performing information 
technology projects, deploying state of the art fraud detection tools to 
crack down on waste, focusing agency leaders on achieving ambitious 
improvements in high priority areas, and opening Government up to the 
public to increase accountability and accelerate innovation.
The American people must be able to trust that their Government is doing 
everything in its power to stop wasteful practices and earn a high 
return on every tax dollar that is spent. To strengthen that trust and 
deliver a smarter and leaner Government, my Administration will 
reinforce the performance and management reform gains achieved thus far; 
systematically identify additional reforms necessary to eliminate 
wasteful, duplicative, or otherwise inefficient programs; and publicize 
these reforms so that they may serve as a model across the Federal 
Government.
The implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 
(Public Law 111-5) (Recovery Act) has seen unprecedented transparency. 
The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB) has developed 
innovative technologies and approaches for preventing and identifying 
fraud and abuse that have the potential to improve performance across 
all of Government spending.
Sec. 2. Accountable Government Initiative. (a) On September 14, 2010, in 
a Memorandum to the Senior Executive Service, my Administration 
introduced goals for the Accountable Government Initiative (Initiative). 
The mission of the Initiative is to monitor and promote agency progress 
in making Government work better, faster, and more efficiently. To hold 
executive

[[Page 251]]

departments and agencies (agencies) accountable for obtaining results 
consistent with this mission, the Vice President shall convene periodic 
meetings in which Cabinet members and the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) report to him on improvements implemented 
under their direction.
    (b) The Federal Chief Performance Officer (CPO), who also serves as 
the Deputy Director for Management of OMB and the Chair of the 
President's Management Council (PMC), shall work with the PMC to support 
agencies' performance and management reform and cost-cutting efforts. 
The CPO will lead OMB and the PMC in identifying practices that should 
be adopted across agencies and in facilitating reforms that require 
cross-agency coordination and cooperation. The CPO shall work with 
agencies to ensure that each area identified as critical to performance 
improvement has robust performance metrics in place, and that these 
metrics are frequently analyzed and reviewed by agency leadership. 
Agencies shall update these metrics quarterly, as appropriate, on the 
website performance.gov.
    (c) In accordance with the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (31 U.S.C. 
1115 et seq.), each agency's Chief Operating Officer (COO) shall be 
designated as the Senior Accountable Official responsible for leading 
performance and management reform efforts, and for reducing wasteful or 
ineffective programs, policies, and procedures. In discharging this 
responsibility, this official shall be accountable for conducting 
frequent data-driven reviews of agency progress toward goals in the 
areas that OMB identifies as being critical to performance improvement 
across agencies or that the agency head identifies as top near-term 
priorities. These goals may include reforming information technology, 
reducing improper payments, leveraging the Federal Government's 
purchasing scale, reducing high-risk contracting practices, improving 
the management of Federal real estate, enhancing customer service, and 
achieving agency and Federal Government priority goals identified 
pursuant to the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010.
    (d) The Director of OMB shall provide guidance to agencies as part 
of the Fiscal Year 2013 budget process for identifying areas of program 
overlap and duplication within and across agencies, and for proposing 
consolidations and reductions to address those inefficiencies.
    (e) The Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) at all agencies shall be 
responsible for achieving agency cost savings. This will include each 
agency's share of the $2.1 billion in administrative cost savings 
identified in my Fiscal Year 2012 Budget, and for achieving those 
savings as quickly as possible. The CFOs are encouraged to realize these 
cost savings by targeting wasteful practices and by reducing, and 
identifying alternatives to, discretionary travel, the use of 
consultants, and other administrative expenses. The Federal CFO Council 
shall provide a monthly report on these efforts to the PMC, with 
relevant findings and progress reported on performance.gov.
Sec. 3. Government Accountability and Transparency Board. (a) There is 
hereby established a Government Accountability and Transparency Board 
(Board) to provide strategic direction for enhancing the transparency of 
Federal spending and advance efforts to detect and remediate fraud, 
waste, and abuse in Federal programs. The Board shall be composed of 11 
members designated by the President from among agency Inspectors 
General, agency Chief Financial Officers or Deputy Secretaries, a senior 
official of

[[Page 252]]

OMB, and such other members as the President shall designate. The 
President shall designate a Chair from among the members. Building on 
the lessons learned from the successful implementation of the Recovery 
Act, the Board shall work with the RATB to apply the approaches 
developed by the RATB across Government spending.
    (b) Not later than 6 months after the date of this order, the Board 
shall submit a report to the President that identifies implementation 
guidelines for integrating systems that support the collection and 
display of Government spending data, ensuring the reliability of those 
data, and broadening the deployment of fraud detection technologies, 
including those proven successful during the implementation of the 
Recovery Act.
    (c) The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Board, shall be 
responsible for assisting executive agencies in achieving objectives in 
the guidelines identified in subsection (b) above.
    (d) The Chair of the Board, in consultation with the Director of 
OMB, shall provide monthly updates to the Vice President on the progress 
obtained under this order.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
related to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13577 of June 15, 2011

Establishment of the SelectUSA Initiative

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to support private-
sector job creation and enhance economic growth by encouraging and 
supporting business investment in the United States, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Business investment in the United States by both 
domestic and foreign firms, whether in the form of new equipment or 
facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, is a major engine of 
economic growth and job creation. In an era of global capital mobility, 
the United States faces increasing competition for retaining and 
attracting industries of the

[[Page 253]]

future and the jobs they create. My Administration is committed to 
enhancing the efforts of the United States to win the growing global 
competition for business investment by leveraging our advantages as the 
premier business location in the world.
As a place to do business, the United States offers a hardworking, 
diverse, and educated workforce, strong protection of intellectual 
property rights, a predictable and transparent legal system, relatively 
low taxes, highly developed infrastructure, and access to the world's 
most lucrative consumer market. We welcome both domestic and foreign 
businesses to invest across the broad spectrum of the U.S. market.
The Federal Government lacks the centralized investment promotion 
infrastructure and resources to attract business investment that is 
often found in other industrialized countries. Currently, States and 
cities are competing against foreign governments to attract business 
investment. Our Nation needs to retain business investment and pursue 
and win new investment in the United States by better marketing our 
strengths, providing clear, complete, and consistent information, and 
removing unnecessary obstacles to investment.
Sec. 2. SelectUSA Initiative. (a) Establishment. There is established 
the SelectUSA Initiative (Initiative), a Government-wide initiative to 
attract and retain investment in the American economy. The Initiative is 
to be housed in the Department of Commerce. The mission of this 
Initiative shall be to facilitate business investment in the United 
States in order to create jobs, spur economic growth, and promote 
American competitiveness. The Initiative will provide enhanced 
coordination of Federal activities in order to increase the impact of 
Federal resources that support both domestic and foreign investment in 
the United States. In providing assistance, the Initiative shall work to 
maximize impact on business investment, job creation, and economic 
growth. The Initiative shall work on behalf of the entire Nation and 
shall exercise strict neutrality with regard to specific locations 
within the United States.
    (b) Functions.

(i) The Initiative shall coordinate outreach and engagement by the Federal 
Government to promote the United States as the premier location to operate 
a business.

(ii) The Initiative shall serve as an ombudsman that facilitates the 
resolution of issues involving Federal programs or activities related to 
pending investments.

(iii) The Initiative shall provide information to domestic and foreign 
firms on: the investment climate in the United States; Federal programs and 
incentives available to investors; and State and local economic development 
organizations.

(iv) The Initiative shall report quarterly to the President through the 
National Economic Council, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National 
Security Staff, describing its outreach activities, requests for 
information received, and efforts to resolve issues.

    (c) Administration. The Department of Commerce shall provide funding 
and administrative support for the Initiative through resources and 
staff assigned to work on the Initiative, to the extent permitted by law 
and within

[[Page 254]]

existing appropriations. The Secretary of Commerce shall designate a 
senior staff member as the Executive Director to lead the Initiative. 
The Executive Director shall coordinate activities both within the 
Department of Commerce and with other executive departments and agencies 
that have activities relating to business investment decisions.
    (d) Federal Interagency Investment Working Group.

(i) There is established the Federal Interagency Investment Working Group 
(Working Group), which will be convened and chaired by the Initiative's 
Executive Director, in coordination with the Director of the National 
Economic Council.

(ii) The Working Group shall consist of senior officials from the 
Departments of State, the Treasury, Defense, Justice, the Interior, 
Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, 
Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education, and 
Homeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Small Business 
Administration, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Office of 
the United States Trade Representative, the Domestic Policy Council, the 
National Economic Council, the National Security Staff, the Office of 
Management and Budget, and the Council of Economic Advisers, as well as 
such additional executive departments, agencies, and offices as the 
Secretary of Commerce may designate. Senior officials shall be designated 
by and report to the Deputy Secretary or official at the equivalent level 
of their respective offices, departments, and agencies.

(iii) The Working Group shall coordinate activities to promote business 
investment and respond to specific issues that affect business investment 
decisions.

(iv) The Department of Commerce shall provide funding and administrative 
support for the Working Group to the extent permitted by law and within 
existing appropriations.

    (e) Department and Agency Participation. All executive departments 
and agencies that have activities relating to business investment 
decisions shall cooperate with the Initiative, as requested by the 
Initiative's Executive Director, to support its objectives.
Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal 
Government; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party

[[Page 255]]

against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its 
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13578 of July 6, 2011

Coordinating Policies on Automotive Communities and Workers

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Over the last decade, the United States has 
experienced a decline in employment in the automotive industry and among 
part suppliers. This decline accelerated dramatically from 2008 to 2009, 
with more than 400,000 jobs being lost in the industry. Now, 2 years 
later, the American automotive industry is beginning to recover. The 
automotive industry has, over the past 2 years, experienced its 
strongest period of job growth since the late 1990s. Exports have 
expanded, and the domestic automakers in 2010 gained market share for 
the first time since 1995. The automotive supply chain, which employs 
three times as many workers as the automakers, has also shown renewed 
strength. However, we still have a long way to go.
Over the past 2 years my Administration has undertaken coordinated 
efforts on behalf of automotive communities, including targeted 
technical and financial assistance. For example, the Department of Labor 
set aside funds for green jobs and job training for high-growth sectors 
of the economy specifically targeted to communities affected by the 
automotive downturn, and the Department of Commerce provided funds 
specifically for automotive communities to develop plans for economic 
recovery. Stabilizing the automotive industry will also require the use 
of expanded strategies by automotive communities that include land-use 
redevelopment, small business support, and worker training.
The purpose of this order is to continue the coordinated Federal 
response to factors affecting automotive communities and workers and to 
ensure that Federal programs and policies address these concerns.
Sec. 2. Assignment of Responsibilities to the Secretary of Labor.
    (a) The Secretary of Labor shall:

(i) work to coordinate the development of policies and programs among 
executive departments and agencies with the goal of coordinating a Federal 
response to factors that have a distinct impact on automotive communities 
and workers, including through the coordination of economic adjustment 
assistance activities;

(ii) advise the President, in coordination with the Director of the 
National Economic Council, on the potential effects of pending legislation;

[[Page 256]]

(iii) provide recommendations to the President, in coordination with the 
Director of the National Economic Council, on executive branch policy 
proposals affecting automotive communities and changes to Federal policies 
and programs intended to address issues of special importance to automotive 
communities and workers; and

(iv) conduct outreach to representatives of nonprofit organizations, 
businesses, labor organizations, State and local government agencies, 
elected officials, and other interested persons that will assist in 
bringing to the President's attention concerns, ideas, and policy options 
for expanding and improving efforts to revitalize automotive communities.

    (b) The Secretary of Labor shall perform the functions assigned by 
this order in coordination with the Director of the National Economic 
Council. The Secretary of Labor may delegate these responsibilities to 
the Executive Director of the Department of Labor Office of Recovery for 
Auto Communities and Workers.
Sec. 3. Revocation. Executive Order 13509 of June 23, 2009, is hereby 
revoked.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) The heads of executive departments and 
agencies shall assist and provide information to the Secretary of Labor 
or the Secretary's designee, consistent with applicable law, as may be 
necessary to carry out the responsibilities assigned by this order.
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13579 of July 11, 2011

Regulation and Independent Regulatory Agencies

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to improve regulation 
and regulatory review, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. (a) Wise regulatory decisions depend on public 
participation and on careful analysis of the likely consequences of 
regulation. Such decisions are informed and improved by allowing 
interested members of the public to have a meaningful opportunity to 
participate in rulemaking.

[[Page 257]]

To the extent permitted by law, such decisions should be made only after 
consideration of their costs and benefits (both quantitative and 
qualitative).
    (b) Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011, ``Improving 
Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' directed to executive agencies, was 
meant to produce a regulatory system that protects ``public health, 
welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting economic growth, 
innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.'' Independent regulatory 
agencies, no less than executive agencies, should promote that goal.
    (c) Executive Order 13563 set out general requirements directed to 
executive agencies concerning public participation, integration and 
innovation, flexible approaches, and science. To the extent permitted by 
law, independent regulatory agencies should comply with these provisions 
as well.
Sec. 2. Retrospective Analyses of Existing Rules. (a) To facilitate the 
periodic review of existing significant regulations, independent 
regulatory agencies should consider how best to promote retrospective 
analysis of rules that may be outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or 
excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal 
them in accordance with what has been learned. Such retrospective 
analyses, including supporting data and evaluations, should be released 
online whenever possible.
    (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, each independent 
regulatory agency should develop and release to the public a plan, 
consistent with law and reflecting its resources and regulatory 
priorities and processes, under which the agency will periodically 
review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any 
such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed 
so as to make the agency's regulatory program more effective or less 
burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.
Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) For purposes of this order, ``executive 
agency'' shall have the meaning set forth for the term ``agency'' in 
section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, and 
``independent regulatory agency'' shall have the meaning set forth in 44 
U.S.C. 3502(5).
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13580 of July 12, 2011

Interagency Working Group on Coordination of Domestic Energy Development 
and Permitting in Alaska

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish an 
interagency working group to coordinate the efforts of Federal agencies 
responsible for overseeing the safe and responsible development of 
onshore and offshore energy resources and associated infrastructure in 
Alaska and to help reduce our dependence on foreign oil, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Interagency coordination is important for the safe, 
responsible, and efficient development of oil and natural gas resources 
in Alaska, both onshore and on the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), 
while protecting human health and the environment, as well as indigenous 
populations. A number of executive departments and agencies (agencies)

Transportation Projects.

    (b) The Domestic Policy Council shall work closely with the Chair of 
the Working Group and assist in the interagency coordination functions 
described in section 4 of this order. To maximize coordination with 
National Security Policy Directive-66 (NSPD-66), ``Arctic Region 
Policy;'' Executive Order 13547 of July 19, 2010 (``Stewardship of the 
Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes''); the National Response 
Framework; the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution 
Contingency Plan (National Contingency Plan); and other relevant Federal

(iii) the Office of Management and Budget; and

(iv) the National Security Staff.

    (c) The Working Group shall consult with other agencies and offices, 
as appropriate, in order to facilitate the sharing of information and 
best practices.
    (d) Members of the Working Group shall meet periodically and on a 
schedule coordinated with significant milestones in the various 
permitting cycles. Staff from the participating agencies shall meet as 
appropriate to facilitate the functions of the Working Group.
Sec. 4. Functions. Consistent with the authorities and responsibilities 
of participating agencies, the Working Group shall perform the following 
functions:
    (a) facilitate orderly and efficient decisionmaking regarding the 
issuance of permits and conduct of environmental reviews for onshore and 
offshore energy development projects in Alaska;
    (b) ensure that the schedules and progress of agency regulatory and 
permitting activities are coordinated appropriately, that they operate 
efficiently and effectively, and that agencies assist one another, as 
appropriate;
    (c) facilitate the sharing of application and project information 
among agencies, including information regarding anticipated timelines 
and milestones;
    (d) ensure the sharing and integrity of scientific and environmental 
information and cultural and traditional knowledge among agencies to 
support the permit evaluation process of onshore and offshore energy 
development projects in Alaska;
    (e) engage in longterm planning and ensure coordination with the 
appropriate Federal entities related to such issues as oil spill 
prevention, preparedness and response, and the development of necessary 
infrastructure to adequately support energy development in Alaska;
    (f) coordinate Federal engagement with States, localities, and 
tribal governments, as it relates to energy development and permitting 
issues in Alaska, including:

(i) designating a primary point of contact to facilitate coordination with 
the State of Alaska;

(ii) designating a primary point of contact to facilitate coordination with 
local communities, governments, tribes, co-management organizations, and 
similar Alaska Native organizations;

    (g) collaborate on stakeholder outreach; and
    (h) promote interagency dialogue with respect to communications with 
industry regarding Alaska offshore and onshore energy development and 
permitting issues.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented 
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of 
appropriations.
    (b) The Department of the Interior shall provide administrative 
support for the Working Group to the extent permitted by law.

[[Page 260]]

    (c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13581 of July 24, 2011

Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that 
the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations, such 
as those listed in the Annex to this order, have reached such scope and 
gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and 
economic systems. Such organizations are becoming increasingly 
sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly 
entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the 
international financial system, thereby weakening democratic 
institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic 
markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil 
conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous 
persons. I therefore determine that significant transnational criminal 
organizations constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and 
hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.
Accordingly, I hereby order:
Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:

(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order and

(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State:

  (A) to be a foreign person that constitutes a significant transnational 
criminal organization;

[[Page 261]]

  (B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in 
support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to this order; or

  (C) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

    (b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the types of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my 
ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and 
I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by subsection (a) of this 
section.
    (c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section include, but 
are not limited to:

(i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and

(ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.

    (d) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except 
to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;
    (d) the term ``foreign person'' means any citizen or national of a 
foreign state, or any entity organized under the laws of a foreign state 
or existing in a foreign state, including any such individual or entity 
who is also a United States person; and
    (e) the term ``significant transnational criminal organization'' 
means a group of persons, such as those listed in the Annex to this 
order, that includes one or more foreign persons; that engages in an 
ongoing pattern of serious criminal activity involving the jurisdictions 
of at least two foreign

[[Page 262]]

states; and that threatens the national security, foreign policy, or 
economy of the United States.
Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, 
there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made 
pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney 
General and the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such 
actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to 
employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary 
to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury 
may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of 
the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All 
agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all 
appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions 
of this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney 
General and the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the 
recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency 
declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 
U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney 
General and the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine 
that circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the property and 
interests in property of a person listed in the Annex to this order, and 
to take necessary action to give effect to that determination.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 9. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
July 25, 2011.

National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, in order to 
take additional steps with respect to the Government of Syria's 
continuing escalation of violence against the people of Syria and with 
respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 of 
May 11, 2004, as modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps 
taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 
of February 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, and 
Executive Order 13573 of May 18, 2011, hereby order:
Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any overseas branch, of the Government of Syria are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in.
(b) All property and interests in property that are in the United 
States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:
(i) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support 
of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to this order; or
(ii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
Sec. 2. The following are prohibited:
(a) new investment in Syria by a United States person, wherever located;
(b) the exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or 
indirectly, from the United States, or by a United States person, 
wherever located, of any services to Syria;
(c) the importation into the United States of petroleum or petroleum 
products of Syrian origin;
(d) any transaction or dealing by a United States person, wherever 
located, including purchasing, selling, transporting, swapping,

related to petroleum or petroleum products of Syrian origin; and

[[Page 265]]

(e) any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a United 
States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a foreign person 
where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this 
section if performed by a United States person or within the United 
States.
Sec. 3. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously 
impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13338 and expanded in scope in Executive Order 13572, 
and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this 
order.
Sec. 4. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not 
limited to:
(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.
Sec. 5. The prohibitions in sections 1 and 2 of this order apply except 
to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 6. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 7. Nothing in sections 1 or 2 of this order shall prohibit 
transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal 
Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.
Sec. 8. For the purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States; and
(d) the term ``Government of Syria'' means the Government of the Syrian 
Arab Republic, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities.
Sec. 9. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I

[[Page 266]]

therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in 
addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 and 
expanded in scope in Executive Order 13572, there need be no prior 
notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this 
order.
Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 11. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity 
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 12. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
August 18, 2011.

Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011

Establishing a Coordinated Government-Wide Initiative to Promote 
Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote the 
Federal workplace as a model of equal opportunity, diversity, and 
inclusion, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy.  Our Nation derives strength from the diversity of 
its population and from its commitment to equal opportunity for all. We 
are at our best when we draw on the talents of all parts of our society, 
and our greatest accomplishments are achieved when diverse perspectives 
are brought to bear to overcome our greatest challenges.
A commitment to equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion is critical 
for the Federal Government as an employer. By law, the Federal 
Government's recruitment policies should ``endeavor to achieve a work 
force from all segments of society.'' (5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1)). As the 
Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government has a special 
obligation to lead by example. Attaining a diverse, qualified workforce 
is one of the cornerstones of the merit-based civil service.
Prior Executive Orders, including but not limited to those listed below, 
have taken a number of steps to address the leadership role and 
obligations of the Federal Government as an employer. For example, 
Executive Order

[[Page 267]]

13171 of October 12, 2000 (Hispanic Employment in the Federal 
Government), directed executive departments and agencies to implement 
programs for recruitment and career development of Hispanic employees 
and established a mechanism for identifying best practices in doing so. 
Executive Order 13518 of November 9, 2009 (Employment of Veterans in the 
Federal Government), required the establishment of a Veterans Employment 
Initiative. Executive Order 13548 of July 26, 2010 (Increasing Federal 
Employment of Individuals with Disabilities), and its related 
predecessors, Executive Order 13163 of July 26, 2000 (Increasing the 
Opportunity for Individuals With Disabilities to be Employed in the 
Federal Government), and Executive Order 13078 of March 13, 1998 
(Increasing Employment of Adults With Disabilities), sought to tap the 
skills of the millions of Americans living with disabilities.
To realize more fully the goal of using the talents of all segments of 
society, the Federal Government must continue to challenge itself to 
enhance its ability to recruit, hire, promote, and retain a more diverse 
workforce. Further, the Federal Government must create a culture that 
encourages collaboration, flexibility, and fairness to enable 
individuals to participate to their full potential.
Wherever possible, the Federal Government must also seek to consolidate 
compliance efforts established through related or overlapping statutory 
mandates, directions from Executive Orders, and regulatory requirements. 
By this order, I am directing executive departments and agencies 
(agencies) to develop and implement a more comprehensive, integrated, 
and strategic focus on diversity and inclusion as a key component of 
their human resources strategies. This approach should include a 
continuing effort to identify and adopt best practices, implemented in 
an integrated manner, to promote diversity and remove barriers to equal 
employment opportunity, consistent with merit system principles and 
applicable law.
Sec. 2. Government-Wide Diversity and Inclusion Initiative and Strategic 
Plan.  The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the 
Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), in coordination with the President's Management Council (PMC) and 
the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), shall:
    (a) establish a coordinated Government-wide initiative to promote 
diversity and inclusion in the Federal workforce;
    (b) within 90 days of the date of this order:

(i) develop and issue a Government-wide Diversity and Inclusion Strategic 
Plan (Government-wide Plan), to be updated as appropriate and at a minimum 
every 4 years, focusing on workforce diversity, workplace inclusion, and 
agency accountability and leadership. The Government-wide Plan shall 
highlight comprehensive strategies for agencies to identify and remove 
barriers to equal employment opportunity that may exist in the Federal 
Government's recruitment, hiring, promotion, retention, professional 
development, and training policies and practices;

(ii) review applicable directives to agencies related to the development or 
submission of agency human capital and other workforce plans and reports in 
connection with recruitment, hiring, promotion, retention, professional 
development, and training policies and practices, and develop

[[Page 268]]

a strategy for consolidating such agency plans and reports where 
appropriate and permitted by law; and

(iii) provide guidance to agencies concerning formulation of agency-
specific Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plans prepared pursuant to 
section 3(b) of this order;

    (c) identify appropriate practices to improve the effectiveness of 
each agency's efforts to recruit, hire, promote, retain, develop, and 
train a diverse and inclusive workforce, consistent with merit system 
principles and applicable law; and
    (d) establish a system for reporting regularly on agencies' progress 
in implementing their agency-specific Diversity and Inclusion Strategic 
Plans and in meeting the objectives of this order.
Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Executive Departments and Agencies.  All 
agencies shall implement the Government-wide Plan prepared pursuant to 
section 2 of this order, and such other related guidance as issued from 
time to time by the Director of OPM and Deputy Director for Management 
of OMB. In addition, the head of each executive department and agency 
referred to under subsections (1) and (2) of section 901(b) of title 31, 
United States Code, shall:
    (a) designate the agency's Chief Human Capital Officer to be 
responsible for enhancing employment and promotion opportunities within 
the agency, in collaboration with the agency's Director of Equal 
Employment Opportunity and Director of Diversity and Inclusion, if any, 
and consistent with law and merit system principles, including 
development and implementation of the agency-specific Diversity and 
Inclusion Strategic Plan;
    (b) within 120 days of the issuance of the Government-wide Plan or 
its update under section 2(b)(i) of this order, develop and submit for 
review to the Director of OPM and the Deputy Director for Management of 
OMB an agency-specific Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan for 
recruiting, hiring, training, developing, advancing, promoting, and 
retaining a diverse workforce consistent with applicable law, the 
Government-wide Plan, merit system principles, the agency's overall 
strategic plan, its human capital plan prepared pursuant to Part 250 of 
title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and other applicable 
workforce planning strategies and initiatives;
    (c) implement the agency-specific Diversity and Inclusion Strategic 
Plan after incorporating it into the agency's human capital plan; and
    (d) provide information as specified in the reporting requirements 
developed under section 2(d).
Sec. 4. General Provisions.  (a) Nothing in this order shall be 
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted to a department or agency or the head thereof, 
including the authority granted to EEOC by other Executive Orders 
(including Executive Order 12067) or any agency's authority to establish an 
independent Diversity and Inclusion Office; or

(ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

[[Page 269]]

    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13584 of September 9, 2011

Developing an Integrated Strategic Counterterrorism Communications 
Initiative and Establishing a Temporary Organization To Support Certain 
Government-Wide Communications Activities Directed Abroad

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 2656 of title 
22, United States Code, and section 3161 of title 5, United States Code, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The United States is committed to actively countering 
the actions and ideologies of al-Qa'ida, its affiliates and adherents, 
other terrorist organizations, and violent extremists overseas that 
threaten the interests and national security of the United States. These 
efforts take many forms, but all contain a communications element and 
some use of communications strategies directed to audiences outside the 
United States to counter the ideology and activities of such 
organizations. These communications strategies focus not only on the 
violent actions and human costs of terrorism, but also on narratives 
that can positively influence those who may be susceptible to 
radicalization and recruitment by terrorist organizations.
The purpose of this Executive Order is to reinforce, integrate, and 
complement public communications efforts across the executive branch 
that are (1) focused on countering the actions and ideology of al-
Qa'ida, its affiliates and adherents, and other international terrorist 
organizations and violent extremists overseas, and (2) directed to 
audiences outside the United States. This collaborative work among 
executive departments and agencies (agencies) brings together expertise, 
capabilities, and resources to realize efficiencies and better 
coordination of U.S. Government communications investments to combat 
terrorism and extremism.
Sec. 2. Assigned Responsibilities to the Center for Strategic 
Counterterrorism Communications.
    (a) Under the direction of the Secretary of State (Secretary), the 
Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (Center) that has 
been established in the Department of State by the Secretary shall 
coordinate, orient, and inform Government-wide public communications 
activities directed at audiences abroad and targeted against violent 
extremists and terrorist organizations, especially al-Qa'ida and its 
affiliates and adherents,

[[Page 270]]

with the goal of using communication tools to reduce radicalization by 
terrorists and extremist violence and terrorism that threaten the 
interests and national security of the United States. Consistent with 
section 404o of title 50, United States Code, the Center shall 
coordinate its analysis, evaluation, and planning functions with the 
National Counterterrorism Center. The Center shall also coordinate these 
functions with other agencies, as appropriate.
Executive branch efforts undertaken through the Center shall draw on all 
agencies with relevant information or capabilities, to prepare, plan 
for, and conduct these communications efforts.
    (b) To achieve these objectives, the Center's functions shall 
include:

(i) monitoring and evaluating narratives (overarching communication themes 
that reflect a community's identity, experiences, aspirations, and 
concerns) and events abroad that are relevant to the development of a U.S. 
strategic counterterrorism narrative designed to counter violent extremism 
and terrorism that threaten the interests and national security of the 
United States;

(ii) developing and promulgating for use throughout the executive branch 
the U.S. strategic counterterrorism narratives and public communications 
strategies to counter the messaging of violent extremists and terrorist 
organizations, especially al-Qa'ida and its affiliates and adherents;

(iii) identifying current and emerging trends in extremist communications 
and communications by al-Qa'ida and its affiliates and adherents in order 
to coordinate and provide thematic guidance to U.S. Government 
communicators on how best to proactively promote the U.S. strategic 
counterterrorism narrative and policies and to respond to and rebut 
extremist messaging and narratives when communicating to audiences outside 
the United States, as informed by a wide variety of Government and non-
government sources, including nongovernmental organizations, academic 
sources, and finished intelligence created by the intelligence community;

(iv) facilitating the use of a wide range of communications technologies, 
including digital tools, by sharing expertise among agencies, seeking 
expertise from external sources, and extending best practices;

(v) identifying and requesting relevant information from agencies, 
including intelligence reporting, data, and analysis; and

(vi) identifying shortfalls in U.S. capabilities in any areas relevant to 
the Center's mission and recommending necessary enhancements or changes.

    (c) The Secretary shall establish a Steering Committee composed of 
senior representatives of agencies relevant to the Center's mission to 
provide advice to the Secretary on the operations and strategic 
orientation of the Center and to ensure adequate support for the Center. 
The Steering Committee shall meet not less than every 6 months. The 
Steering Committee shall be chaired by the Under Secretary of State for 
Public Diplomacy. The Coordinator for Counterterrorism of the Department 
of State shall serve as Vice Chair. The Coordinator of the Center shall 
serve as Executive Secretary. The Steering Committee shall include one 
senior representative designated by the head of each of the following 
agencies: the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the 
Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the Treasury, the 
National Counterterrorism Center, the

[[Page 271]]

Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Counterterrorism Center of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, the Broadcast Board of Governors, and the Agency 
for International Development. Other agencies may be invited to 
participate in the Steering Committee at the discretion of the Chair.
Sec. 3. Establishment of a Temporary Organization.
    (a) There is established within the Department of State, in 
accordance with section 3161 of title 5, United States Code, a temporary 
organization to be known as the Counterterrorism Communications Support 
Office (CCSO).
    (b) The purpose of the CCSO shall be to perform the specific project 
of supporting agencies in Government-wide public communications 
activities targeted against violent extremism and terrorist 
organizations, especially al-Qa'ida and its affiliates and adherents, to 
audiences abroad by using communication tools designed to counter 
violent extremism and terrorism that threaten the interests and national 
security of the United States.
    (c) In carrying out its purpose set forth in subsection (b) of this 
section, the CCSO shall:

(i) support agencies in their implementation of whole-of-government public 
communications activities directed at audiences abroad, including by 
providing baseline research on characteristics of these audiences, by 
developing expertise and studies on aspirations, narratives, information 
strategies and tactics of violent extremists and terrorist organizations 
overseas, by designing and developing sustained campaigns on specific areas 
of interest to audiences abroad, and by developing expertise on 
implementing highly focused social media campaigns; and

(ii) perform such other functions related to the specific project set forth 
in subsection (b) of this section as the Secretary may assign.

    (d) The CCSO shall be headed by a Director selected by the 
Secretary, with the advice of the Steering Committee. Its staff may 
include, as determined by the Secretary: (1) personnel with relevant 
expertise detailed on a non-reimbursable basis from other agencies; (2) 
senior and other technical advisers; and (3) such other personnel as the 
Secretary may direct to support the CCSO. To accomplish this mission, 
the heads of agencies participating on the Steering Committee shall 
provide to the CCSO, on a non-reimbursable basis, assistance, services, 
and other support including but not limited to logistical and 
administrative support and details of personnel. Non-reimbursable 
details shall be based on reasonable requests from the Secretary in 
light of the need for specific expertise, and after consultation with 
the relevant agency, to the extent permitted by law.
    (e) The CCSO shall terminate at the end of the maximum period 
permitted by section 3161(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, unless 
sooner terminated by the Secretary consistent with section 3161(a)(2) of 
such title.
Sec. 4. General Provisions.
    (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

[[Page 272]]

    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Establishing an Emergency Board To Investigate Disputes Between Certain 
Railroads Represented by the National Carriers' Conference Committee of 
the National Railway Labor Conference and Their Employees Represented by 
Certain Labor Organizations

Disputes exist between certain railroads represented by the National 
Carriers' Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference 
and their employees represented by certain labor organizations. The 
railroads and labor organizations involved in these disputes are 
designated on the attached list, which is made part of this order.
The disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of 
the Railway Labor Act, as amended, 45 U.S.C. 151-188 (RLA).
I have been notified by the National Mediation Board that in its 
judgment these disputes threaten substantially to interrupt interstate 
commerce to a degree that would deprive a section of the country of 
essential transportation service.
NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 10 of 
the RLA (45 U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment of Emergency Board (Board). There is 
established, effective 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 7, 
2011, a Board composed of a chair and four other members, all five of 
whom shall be appointed by the President to investigate and report on 
these disputes. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested 
in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier. The Board 
shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds.
Sec. 2. Report. The Board shall report to the President with respect to 
the disputes within 30 days of its creation.
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 10 of the RLA, 
from the date of the creation of the Board and for 30 days after the 
Board has submitted its report to the President, no change in the 
conditions out of which the disputes arose shall be made by the parties 
to the controversy, except by agreement of the parties.
Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of the Board are 
records of the Office of the President and upon the Board's termination 
shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National Mediation 
Board.
Sec. 5. Expiration. The Board shall terminate upon the submission of the 
report provided for in section 2 of this order.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America and in order to ensure the 
responsible sharing and safeguarding of classified national security 
information (classified information) on computer networks, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Our Nation's security requires classified information 
to be shared immediately with authorized users around the world but also 
requires sophisticated and vigilant means to ensure it is shared 
securely. Computer networks have individual and common vulnerabilities 
that require coordinated decisions on risk management.
This order directs structural reforms to ensure responsible sharing and 
safeguarding of classified information on computer networks that shall 
be consistent with appropriate protections for privacy and civil 
liberties. Agencies bear the primary responsibility for meeting these 
twin goals. These structural reforms will ensure coordinated interagency 
development and reliable implementation of policies and minimum 
standards regarding information security, personnel security, and 
systems security; address both internal and external security threats 
and vulnerabilities; and provide policies and minimum standards for 
sharing classified information both within and outside the Federal 
Government. These policies and minimum standards will address all 
agencies that operate or access classified computer networks, all users 
of classified computer networks (including contractors and others who 
operate or access classified computer networks controlled by the Federal 
Government), and all classified information on those networks.
Sec. 2. General Responsibilities of Agencies.
Sec. 2.1. The heads of agencies that operate or access classified 
computer networks shall have responsibility for appropriately sharing 
and safeguarding classified information on computer networks. As part of

Executive Order 13588 of October 31, 2011

Reducing Prescription Drug Shortages

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Shortages of pharmaceutical drugs pose a serious and 
growing threat to public health. While a very small number of drugs in 
the United States experience a shortage in any given year, the number of 
prescription drug shortages in the United States nearly tripled between 
2005 and 2010, and shortages are becoming more severe as well as more 
frequent. The affected medicines include cancer treatments, anesthesia 
drugs, and other drugs that are critical to the treatment and prevention 
of serious diseases and life-threatening conditions.
For example, over approximately the last 5 years, data indicates that 
the use of sterile injectable cancer treatments has increased by about 
20 percent, without a corresponding increase in production capacity. 
While manufacturers are currently in the process of expanding capacity, 
it may be several years before production capacity has been 
significantly increased. Interruptions in the supplies of these drugs 
endanger patient safety and burden doctors, hospitals, pharmacists, and 
patients. They also increase health care costs, particularly because 
some participants in the market may use shortages as opportunities to 
hoard scarce drugs or charge exorbitant prices.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Department of Health and 
Human Services has been working diligently to address this problem 
through its existing regulatory framework. While the root problems and 
many of their solutions are outside of the FDA's control, the agency has 
worked cooperatively with manufacturers to prevent or mitigate shortages 
by expediting review of certain regulatory submissions and adopting a 
flexible approach to drug manufacturing and importation regulations 
where appropriate. As a result, the FDA prevented 137 drug shortages in 
2010 and 2011. Despite these successes, however, the problem of drug 
shortages has continued to grow.
Many different factors contribute to drug shortages, and solving this 
critical public health problem will require a multifaceted approach. An 
important factor in many of the recent shortages appears to be an 
increase in demand that exceeds current manufacturing capacity. While 
manufacturers are in the process of expanding capacity, one important 
step is ensuring that the FDA and the public receive adequate advance 
notice of shortages whenever possible. The FDA cannot begin to work with 
manufacturers or use the other tools at its disposal until it knows 
there is a potential problem. Similarly, early disclosure of a shortage 
can help hospitals, doctors, and patients make alternative arrangements 
before a shortage becomes a crisis. However, drug manufacturers have not 
consistently provided the FDA with adequate notice of potential 
shortages.
As part of my Administration's broader effort to work with 
manufacturers, health care providers, and other stakeholders to prevent 
drug shortages, this order directs the FDA to take steps that will help 
to prevent and reduce current and future disruptions in the supply of 
lifesaving medicines.

[[Page 282]]

Sec. 2. Broader Reporting of Manufacturing Discontinuances. To the 
extent permitted by law, the FDA shall use all appropriate 
administrative tools, including its authority to interpret and 
administer the reporting requirements in 21 U.S.C. 356c, to require drug 
manufacturers to provide adequate advance notice of manufacturing 
discontinuances that could lead to shortages of drugs that are life-
supporting or life-sustaining, or that prevent debilitating disease.
Sec. 3. Expedited Regulatory Review. To the extent practicable, and 
consistent with its statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and 
effectiveness of the drug supply, the FDA shall take steps to expand its 
current efforts to expedite its regulatory reviews, including reviews of 
new drug suppliers, manufacturing sites, and manufacturing changes, 
whenever it determines that expedited review would help to avoid or 
mitigate existing or potential drug shortages. In prioritizing and 
allocating its limited resources, the FDA should consider both the 
severity of the shortage and the importance of the affected drug to 
public health.
Sec. 4. Review of Certain Behaviors by Market Participants. The FDA 
shall communicate to the Department of Justice (DOJ) any findings that 
shortages have led market participants to stockpile the affected drugs 
or sell them at exorbitant prices. The DOJ shall then determine whether 
these activities are consistent with applicable law. Based on its 
determination, DOJ, in coordination with other State and Federal 
regulatory agencies as appropriate, should undertake whatever 
enforcement actions, if any, it deems appropriate.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13589 of November 9, 2011

Promoting Efficient Spending

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to further promote 
efficient spending in the Federal Government, it is hereby ordered as 
follows:

[[Page 283]]

Section 1. Policy. My Administration is committed to cutting waste in 
Federal Government spending and identifying opportunities to promote 
efficient and effective spending. The Federal Government performs 
critical functions that support the basic protections that Americans 
have counted on for decades. As they serve taxpayers, executive 
departments and agencies (agencies) also must act in a fiscally 
responsible manner, including by minimizing their costs, in order to 
perform these mission-critical functions in the most efficient, cost-
effective way. As such, I have pursued an aggressive agenda for reducing 
administrative costs since taking office and, most recently, within my 
Fiscal Year 2012 Budget. Building on this effort, I direct agency heads 
to take even more aggressive steps to ensure the Government is a good 
steward of taxpayer money.
Sec. 2. Agency Reduction Targets. Each agency shall establish a plan for 
reducing the combined costs associated with the activities covered by 
sections 3 through 7 of this order, as well as activities included in 
the Administrative Efficiency Initiative in the Fiscal Year 2012 Budget, 
by not less than 20 percent below Fiscal Year 2010 levels, in Fiscal 
Year 2013. Agency plans for meeting this target shall be submitted to 
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) within 45 days of the date of 
this order. The OMB shall monitor implementation of these plans 
consistent with Executive Order 13576 of June 13, 2011 (Delivering an 
Efficient, Effective, and Accountable Government).
Sec. 3. Travel. (a) Agency travel is important to the effective 
functioning of Government and certain activities can be performed only 
by traveling to a different location. However, to ensure efficient 
travel spending, agencies are encouraged to devise strategic 
alternatives to Government travel, including local or technological 
alternatives, such as teleconferencing and video-conferencing. Agencies 
should make all appropriate efforts to conduct business and host or 
sponsor conferences in space controlled by the Federal Government, 
wherever practicable and cost-effective. Lastly, each agency should 
review its policies associated with domestic civilian permanent change 
of duty station travel (relocations), including eligibility rules, to 
identify ways to reduce costs and ensure appropriate controls are in 
place.
    (b) Each agency, agency component, and office of inspector general 
should designate a senior-level official to be responsible for 
developing and implementing policies and controls to ensure efficient 
spending on travel and conference-related activities, consistent with 
subsection (a) of this section.
Sec. 4. Employee Information Technology Devices. Agencies should assess 
current device inventories and usage, and establish controls, to ensure 
that they are not paying for unused or underutilized information 
technology (IT) equipment, installed software, or services. Each agency 
should take steps to limit the number of IT devices (e.g., mobile 
phones, smartphones, desktop and laptop computers, and tablet personal 
computers) issued to employees, consistent with the Telework Enhancement 
Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-292), operational requirements (including 
continuity of operations), and initiatives designed to create efficiency 
through the effective implementation of technology. To promote further 
efficiencies in IT, agencies should consider the implementation of 
appropriate agency-wide IT solutions that consolidate activities such as 
desktop services, email, and collaboration tools.

[[Page 284]]

Sec. 5. Printing. Agencies are encouraged to limit the publication and 
printing of hard copy documents and to presume that information should 
be provided in an electronic form, whenever practicable, permitted by 
law, and consistent with applicable records retention requirements. 
Agencies should consider using acquisition vehicles developed by the 
OMB's Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative to acquire printing and 
copying devices and services.
Sec. 6. Executive Fleet Efficiencies. The President's Memorandum of May 
24, 2011 (Federal Fleet Performance) directed agencies to improve the 
performance of the Federal fleet of motor vehicles by increasing the use 
of vehicle technologies, optimizing fleet size, and improving agency 
fleet management. Building upon this effort, agencies should limit 
executive transportation.
Sec. 7. Extraneous Promotional Items. Agencies should limit the purchase 
of promotional items (e.g., plaques, clothing, and commemorative items), 
in particular where they are not cost-effective.
Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof;

(ii) functions of the Director of OMB related to budgetary, administrative, 
or legislative proposals; or

(iii) the authority of inspectors general under the Inspector General Act 
of 1978, as amended.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) Independent agencies are requested to adhere to this order.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

any sanctioned person whose property and interests in property are

notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 4. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the

forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 5. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust,

Insurance Act) (12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(1)), including a branch or agency of a 
foreign bank (as defined in section 1(b)(7) of the International Banking

Sec. 6. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of

order.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or

1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those 
later actions.
Sec. 10. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on 
November 21, 2011.

Executive Order 13592 of December 2, 2011

Improving American Indian and Alaska Native Educational Opportunities 
and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The United States has a unique political and legal 
relationship with the federally recognized American Indian and Alaska 
Native (AI/AN) tribes across the country, as set forth in the 
Constitution of the United States, treaties, Executive Orders, and court 
decisions. For centuries, the Federal Government's relationship with 
these tribes has been guided by a trust responsibility--a long-standing 
commitment on the part of our Government to protect the unique rights 
and ensure the well-being of our Nation's tribes, while respecting their 
tribal sovereignty. In recognition of that special commitment--and in 
fulfillment of the solemn obligations it entails--Federal agencies must 
help improve educational opportunities provided to all AI/AN students, 
including students attending public schools in cities and in rural 
areas, students attending schools operated and funded by the Department 
of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), and students 
attending postsecondary institutions, including Tribal Colleges and 
Universities (TCUs). This is an urgent need. Recent studies show that 
AI/AN students are dropping out of school at an alarming rate, that our 
Nation has made little or no progress in closing the achievement gap 
between AI/AN students and their non-AI/AN student counterparts, and 
that many Native languages are on the verge of extinction.
It is the policy of my Administration to support activities that will 
strengthen the Nation by expanding educational opportunities and 
improving educational outcomes for all AI/AN students in order to 
fulfill our commitment to furthering tribal self-determination and to 
help ensure that AI/AN students have an opportunity to learn their 
Native languages and histories and receive complete and competitive 
educations that prepare them for college, careers, and productive and 
satisfying lives.
My Administration is also committed to improving educational 
opportunities for students attending TCUs. TCUs maintain, preserve, and 
restore Native languages and cultural traditions; offer a high-quality 
college education; provide career and technical education, job training, 
and other career-building programs; and often serve as anchors in some 
of the country's poorest and most remote areas.
Sec. 2. Definitions. (a) ``Agency'' means any executive department or 
agency designated by the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the 
Interior to participate in this order.
    (b) ``Indian tribe'' means an Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, 
nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior 
acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe pursuant to the Federally 
Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. 479a.
    (c) ``American Indian and Alaska Native'' means a member of an 
Indian tribe, as membership is defined by the tribe.

[[Page 291]]

    (d) ``Public school'' means a Head Start center or a pre-
kindergarten, elementary, or secondary school that is predominantly 
funded by public means through the Federal Government, a State, a local 
educational agency, or an Indian tribal government, including a school 
operated directly by or through contract or grant with the BIE, an 
Indian tribe, or a State, county, or local government.
    (e) ``Tribal Colleges and Universities'' are those institutions that 
are chartered by their respective Indian tribes through the sovereign 
authority of the tribes or by the Federal Government, and defined in 
section 316 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1059c).
Sec. 3. White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native 
Education.
    (a) Establishment. There is hereby established the White House 
Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education (Initiative). 
The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Interior will co-
chair the Initiative. The Secretary of Education shall appoint an 
Executive Director who shall be responsible for overseeing 
implementation of the Initiative. This individual shall be a senior-
level, Department of Education official who shall serve as the Secretary 
of Education's senior policy advisor on Federal policies affecting AI/AN 
education.
The Executive Director shall work closely with the BIE Director and 
shall provide periodic reports to the Secretaries of Education and the 
Interior regarding progress achieved under the Initiative. The Executive 
Director shall coordinate frequent consultations with tribal officials 
and shall provide staff support for the National Advisory Council on 
Indian Education (NACIE), authorized by section 7141 of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) (20 U.S.C. 7471).
    (b) Mission and Functions. (1) The Initiative shall help expand 
educational opportunities and improve educational outcomes for all AI/AN 
students, including opportunities to learn their Native languages, 
cultures, and histories and receive complete and competitive educations 
that prepare them for college, careers, and productive and satisfying 
lives, by:
    (i) working closely with the Executive Office of the President to 
help ensure AI/AN participation in the development and implementation of 
key Administration priorities;
    (ii) strengthening the relationship between the Department of 
Education, which has substantial expertise and resources to help improve 
Indian education, and the Department of the Interior and its BIE, which 
directly operates or provides grants to tribes to operate an extensive 
primary, secondary, and college level school system for AI/AN children 
and young adults;
    (iii) coordinating, in consultation with the Department of 
Education's Director of Indian Education, programs administered by the 
Department of Education and other executive branch agencies regarding 
AI/AN education;
    (iv) serving as a liaison with other executive branch agencies on 
AI/AN issues and advising those agencies on how they might help to 
promote AI/AN educational opportunities;
    (v) reporting on the development, implementation, and coordination 
of education policy and programs that affect AI/AN students;

[[Page 292]]

    (vi) furthering tribal sovereignty by supporting efforts, consistent 
with applicable law, to build the capacity of tribal educational 
agencies and TCUs to provide high-quality education services to AI/AN 
children;
    (vii) developing in partnership with tribal educational agencies a 
more routine and streamlined process for entering into agreements for 
educational studies conducted on tribal lands;
    (viii) developing sufficient data resources to inform progress on 
Federal performance indicators, in close collaboration with the 
Department of Education's National Center for Educational Statistics;
    (ix) encouraging and coordinating Federal partnerships with public, 
private, philanthropic, and nonprofit entities to help increase the 
readiness of AI/AN students for school, college, and careers, and to 
help increase the number and percentage of AI/AN students completing 
college; and
    (x) developing a national network of individuals, organizations, and 
communities to share best practices in AI/AN education and encouraging 
them to implement these practices.

(2) In order to help expand educational opportunities and improve education 
outcomes for AI/AN students, the Initiative shall promote, encourage, and 
undertake efforts, consistent with applicable law, to meet the following 
objectives:

    (i) increasing the number and percentage of AI/AN children who enter 
kindergarten ready for success through improved access to high-quality 
early learning programs and services, including Native language 
immersion programs, that encourage the learning and development of AI/AN 
children from birth through age five;
    (ii) supporting the expanded implementation of education reform 
strategies that have shown evidence of success in enabling AI/AN 
students to acquire a rigorous and well-rounded education and increasing 
their access to the support services that prepare them for college, 
careers, and civic involvement;
    (iii) increasing the number and percentage of AI/AN students who 
have access to excellent teachers and school leaders, including 
effective science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), 
language, and special education teachers, in part by supporting efforts 
to improve the recruitment, development, and retention of effective AI/
AN teachers and other effective teachers and school leaders, 
particularly through TCUs;
    (iv) reducing the AI/AN student dropout rate and helping a greater 
number and percentage of those students who stay in high school to be 
ready for college and careers by the time of their graduation and 
college completion, in part by promoting a positive school climate and 
supporting successful and innovative dropout-prevention and recovery 
strategies that better engage AI/AN youths in their learning and help 
them catch up academically;
    (v) providing pathways that enable those who have dropped out to 
reenter educational or training programs and acquire degrees, 
certificates, or industry-recognized credentials and obtain quality 
jobs, and expanding access to high-quality education programs leading to 
career advancement, especially in the STEM fields, by supporting adult, 
career, and technical education;

[[Page 293]]

    (vi) increasing college access and completion for AI/AN students 
through strategies to strengthen the capacity of postsecondary 
institutions, particularly TCUs; and
    (vii) helping to ensure that the unique cultural, educational, and 
language needs of AI/AN students are met.

(3) To facilitate a new partnership between the Department of Education and 
the Department of the Interior, to improve AI/AN education, the Executive 
Director shall work with the BIE Director and develop a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) between the two Departments that will take advantage of 
both Departments' expertise, resources, and facilities. The MOU shall be 
completed within 120 days of the date of this order. Among other things, 
the MOU shall address how the Departments will collaborate in carrying out 
the policy set out in section 1 of this order.

    (c) Funding and Administrative Support. Subject to the availability 
of appropriations, the Department of Education shall fund the 
Initiative, including NACIE. The Department shall also provide 
administrative support for the Initiative to the extent permitted by law 
and within existing appropriations.
    (d) Interagency Working Group. There is established the Interagency 
Working Group on AI/AN education and TCUs, which shall be convened by 
the Initiative's Executive Director. The Working Group shall consist of

Labor, Health and Human Services, and Energy, the Environmental 
Protection Agency, and the White House Domestic Policy Council, as well 
as such additional agencies and offices as the Secretaries of Education 
and the Interior may designate. Senior officials shall be designated by 
the heads of their respective agencies and offices. The Secretaries of 
Education and the Interior shall serve as the co-chairs of the 
Interagency Working Group.
    (e) Federal Agency Plans. (1) Each agency designated by the co-
chairs as a member of the Interagency Working Group shall develop and 
implement a two-part, 4-year plan of the agency's efforts to fulfill the 
purposes of this order, with part one of the plan focusing on all AI/AN 
students except for those attending TCUs, and part two focusing on AI/AN 
students attending TCUs. Each agency plan shall include:
    (i) annual performance indicators and appropriate measurable 
objectives with which the agency will measure its success in meeting the 
goals of this order;
    (ii) information on how the agency intends to increase the capacity 
of educational agencies and institutions, including our Nation's public 
schools and TCUs, to deliver high-quality education and related social 
services to all AI/AN students; and
    (iii) agency efforts to enhance the ability of these educational 
agencies and institutions serving AI/AN students to compete effectively 
for grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, and other Federal 
resources with which to serve the education needs of AI/AN students, and 
to encourage eligible schools and colleges serving those students to 
apply for Federal grants and participate in Federal education programs, 
as appropriate. Agency plans may also emphasize access to high-quality 
educational opportunities for AI/AN students, consistent with 
requirements of the ESEA, the Individuals

[[Page 294]]

with Disabilities Education Act, and other applicable Federal education 
statutes; the preservation and revitalization of tribal languages and 
cultural traditions; and innovative approaches to more seamlessly align 
early learning, elementary, and secondary education programs with the 
work of TCUs.

(2) Submission. Each agency shall submit its plan to the Initiative by a 
deadline established by the co-chairs. In consultation with NACIE, the 
Initiative shall then review agency plans and develop, for submission to 
the President, a synthesized interagency plan to achieve the aims of this 
order.

(3) Annual Performance Reports. Each agency shall submit to the Initiative 
an Annual Performance Report that measures the agency's performance against 
the objectives set forth in its plan. In consultation with NACIE, the 
Initiative shall review and combine Annual Performance Reports from the 
various agencies into one annual report, which shall be submitted to the 
Secretaries of Education and the Interior for review.

    (f) Private Sector. In consultation with NACIE, and consistent with 
applicable law, the Interagency Working Group, led by the Executive 
Director, shall encourage the private sector to assist State- and 
locally-operated public schools that serve large numbers of AI/AN 
students, including those attending our Nation's public schools, 
publicly-funded preschools, and TCUs, through increased use of such 
strategies as:

Order 13585 of September 30, 2011.
    (d) The heads of agencies shall assist and provide such information 
to the Initiative as may be necessary to carry out its functions, 
consistent with applicable law.
    (e) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(1) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

[[Page 295]]

(2) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (f) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13595 of December 19, 2011

Instituting a National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. (a) The United States recognizes that promoting 
women's participation in conflict prevention, management, and 
resolution, as well as in post-conflict relief and recovery, advances 
peace, national security, economic and social development, and 
international cooperation.
    (b) The United States recognizes the responsibility of all nations 
to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic 
cleansing, and crimes against humanity, including when implemented by 
means of sexual violence. The United States further recognizes that 
sexual violence, when used or commissioned as a tactic of war or as a 
part of a widespread or systematic attack against civilians, can 
exacerbate and prolong armed conflict and impede the restoration of 
peace and security.
    (c) It shall be the policy and practice of the executive branch of 
the United States to have a National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and 
Security (National Action Plan).
Sec. 2. National Action Plan. A National Action Plan shall be created 
pursuant to the process outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 1 and 
shall identify and develop activities and initiatives in the following 
areas:
    (a) National integration and institutionalization. Through 
interagency coordination, policy development, enhanced professional 
training and education, and evaluation, the United States Government 
will institutionalize a gender-responsive approach to its diplomatic, 
development, and defense-related work in conflict-affected environments.
    (b) Participation in peace processes and decisionmaking. The United 
States Government will improve the prospects for inclusive, just, and 
sustainable peace by promoting and strengthening women's rights and 
effective leadership and substantive participation in peace processes, 
conflict prevention, peacebuilding, transitional processes, and 
decisionmaking institutions in conflict-affected environments.
    (c) Protection from violence. The United States Government will 
strengthen its efforts to prevent--and protect women and children from--
harm, exploitation, discrimination, and abuse, including sexual and 
gender-based violence and trafficking in persons, and to hold 
perpetrators accountable in conflict-affected environments.
    (d) Conflict prevention. The United States Government will promote 
women's roles in conflict prevention, improve conflict early-warning and 
response systems through the integration of gender perspectives, and 
invest in women and girls' health, education, and economic opportunity 
to create conditions for stable societies and lasting peace.
    (e) Access to relief and recovery. The United States Government will 
respond to the distinct needs of women and children in conflict-affected 
disasters and crises, including by providing safe, equitable access to 
humanitarian assistance.

[[Page 322]]

Sec. 3. Responsibility of Executive Departments and Agencies. (a) 
Executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall maintain a current 
awareness of U.S. policy with regard to Women, Peace, and Security, as 
set out in the National Action Plan, as it is relevant to their 
functions, and shall perform such functions so as to respect and 
implement that policy fully, while retaining their established 
institutional roles in the implementation, interpretation, and 
enforcement of Federal law.
    (b) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the 
Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development 
shall each:

(i) designate one or more officers, as appropriate, as responsible for 
coordinating and implementing the National Action Plan;

(ii) within 150 days of the date of the release of the National Action 
Plan, develop and submit to the Assistant to the President and National 
Security Advisor an agency-specific implementation plan that will identify 
the actions each agency plans to take to implement the National Action 
Plan; and

(iii) execute their agency-specific implementation plans, and monitor and 
report to the Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor on 
such execution.

Sec. 4. Interagency Process. The Assistant to the President and National 
Security Advisor shall, consistent with Presidential Policy Directive 1 
or any successor documents, establish an interagency process for 
coordinating the implementation of this order, which shall, inter alia:
    (a) coordinate implementation of the National Action Plan and 
agency-specific implementation plans as specified in section 3(b) of 
this order;
    (b) establish a mechanism for agencies to report progress in 
implementing the National Action Plan and agency-specific implementation 
plans, as appropriate and as specified in section 3(b), and in meeting 
the objectives of this order, which the Assistant to the President and 
National Security Advisor shall draw upon to provide an annual report to 
the President;
    (c) coordinate a comprehensive periodic review of, and update to, 
the National Action Plan. The review of, and update to, the National 
Action Plan will be informed by consultation with relevant civil society 
organizations. The first review will take place in 2015; and
    (d) consider and implement other revisions to the National Action 
Plan, as necessary.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with this 
order.

[[Page 323]]

    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Disestablishment of United States Joint Forces Command

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to my authority as Commander in Chief and under 10 U.S.C. 161, 
I hereby accept the recommendations of the Secretary of Defense and 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and approve the disestablishment 
of United States Joint Forces Command, effective on a date to be 
determined by the Secretary of Defense. I direct this action be 
reflected in the 2010 Unified Command Plan.
Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 161(b)(2) and 3 U.S.C. 301, you are directed to 
notify the Congress on my behalf.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

Notice of January 13, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four 
additional persons, including Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt 
the Middle East peace process.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures 
adopted on that date and on August 20, 1998, to deal with that emergency 
must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2011. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.
BARACK OBAMA
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    January 13, 2011.
Memorandum of January 18, 2011

Regulatory Compliance

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to enhancing effectiveness and efficiency 
in Government. Pursuant to the Memorandum on Transparency and Open 
Government, issued on January 21, 2009, executive departments and 
agencies (agencies) have been working steadily to promote 
accountability, encourage collaboration, and provide information to 
Americans about their Government's activities.
To that end, much progress has been made toward strengthening our 
democracy and improving how Government operates. In the regulatory area, 
several agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, have begun to post online (at ogesdw.dol.gov and 
www.epa-echo.gov), and to make readily accessible to the public, 
information concerning their regulatory compliance and enforcement 
activities,

[[Page 327]]

such as information with respect to administrative inspections, 
examinations, reviews, warnings, citations, and revocations (but 
excluding law enforcement or otherwise sensitive information about 
ongoing enforcement actions).
Greater disclosure of regulatory compliance information fosters fair and 
consistent enforcement of important regulatory obligations. Such 
disclosure is a critical step in encouraging the public to hold the 
Government and regulated entities accountable. Sound regulatory 
enforcement promotes the welfare of Americans in many ways, by 
increasing public safety, improving working conditions, and protecting 
the air we breathe and the water we drink. Consistent regulatory 
enforcement also levels the playing field among regulated entities, 
ensuring that those that fail to comply with the law do not have an 
unfair advantage over their law-abiding competitors. Greater agency 
disclosure of compliance and enforcement data will provide Americans 
with information they need to make informed decisions. Such disclosure 
can lead the Government to hold itself more accountable, encouraging 
agencies to identify and address enforcement gaps.
Accordingly, I direct the following:
First, agencies with broad regulatory compliance and administrative 
enforcement responsibilities, within 120 days of this memorandum, to the 
extent feasible and permitted by law, shall develop plans to make public 
information concerning their regulatory compliance and enforcement 
activities accessible, downloadable, and searchable online. In so doing, 
agencies should prioritize making accessible information that is most 
useful to the general public and should consider the use of new 
technologies to allow the public to have access to real-time data. The 
independent agencies are encouraged to comply with this directive.
Second, the Federal Chief Information Officer and the Chief Technology 
Officer shall work with appropriate counterparts in each agency to make 
such data available online in searchable form, including on centralized 
platforms such as data.gov, in a manner that facilitates easy access, 
encourages cross-agency comparisons, and engages the public in new and 
creative ways of using the information.
Third, the Federal Chief Information Officer and the Chief Technology 
Officer, in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) and their counterparts in each agency, shall work to 
explore how best to generate and share enforcement and compliance 
information across the Government, consistent with law. Such data 
sharing can assist with agencies' risk-based approaches to enforcement: 
A lack of compliance in one area by a regulated entity may indicate a 
need for examination and closer attention by another agency. Efforts to 
share data across agencies, where appropriate and permitted by law, may 
help to promote flexible and coordinated enforcement regimes.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. 
Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

memorandum in the Federal Register.

THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, January 18, 2011.
Memorandum of January 18, 2011

Regulatory Flexibility, Small Business, and Job Creation

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Small businesses play an essential role in the American economy; they 
help to fuel productivity, economic growth, and job creation. More than 
half of all Americans working in the private sector either are employed 
by a small business or own one. During a recent 15-year period, small 
businesses created more than 60 percent of all new jobs in the Nation.
Although small businesses and new companies provide the foundations for 
economic growth and job creation, they have faced severe challenges as a 
result of the recession. One consequence has been the loss of 
significant numbers of jobs.
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612, establishes a 
deep national commitment to achieving statutory goals without imposing 
unnecessary burdens on the public. The RFA emphasizes the importance of 
recognizing ``differences in the scale and resources of regulated 
entities'' and of considering ``alternative regulatory approaches . . . 
which minimize the significant economic impact of rules on small 
businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.'' 
5 U.S.C. 601 note.
To promote its central goals, the RFA imposes a series of requirements 
designed to ensure that agencies produce regulatory flexibility analyses 
that give careful consideration to the effects of their regulations on 
small businesses and explore significant alternatives in order to 
minimize any significant economic impact on small businesses. Among 
other things, the RFA requires that when an agency proposing a rule with 
such impact is required to provide notice of the proposed rule, it must 
also produce an initial regulatory flexibility analysis that includes 
discussion of significant alternatives. Significant alternatives include 
the use of performance rather than design standards; simplification of 
compliance and reporting requirements for small businesses; 
establishment of different timetables that take into account the 
resources of small businesses; and exemption from coverage for small 
businesses.
Consistent with the goal of open government, the RFA also encourages 
public participation in and transparency about the rulemaking process. 
Among other things, the statute requires agencies proposing rules with a 
significant economic impact on small businesses to provide an 
opportunity for public

[[Page 329]]

comment on any required initial regulatory flexibility analysis, and 
generally requires agencies promulgating final rules with such 
significant economic impact to respond, in a final regulatory 
flexibility analysis, to comments filed by the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.
My Administration is firmly committed to eliminating excessive and 
unjustified burdens on small businesses, and to ensuring that 
regulations are designed with careful consideration of their effects, 
including their cumulative effects, on small businesses. Executive Order 
12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended, states, ``Each agency shall 
tailor its regulations to impose the least burden on society, including 
individuals, businesses of differing sizes, and other entities 
(including small communities and governmental entities), consistent with 
obtaining the regulatory objectives, taking into account, among other 
things, and to the extent practicable, the costs of cumulative 
regulations.''
In the current economic environment, it is especially important for 
agencies to design regulations in a cost-effective manner consistent 
with the goals of promoting economic growth, innovation, 
competitiveness, and job creation.
Accordingly, I hereby direct executive departments and agencies and 
request independent agencies, when initiating rulemaking that will have 
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, 
to give serious consideration to whether and how it is appropriate, 
consistent with law and regulatory objectives, to reduce regulatory 
burdens on small businesses, through increased flexibility. As the RFA 
recognizes, such flexibility may take many forms, including:
    <bullet> extended compliance dates that take into account the 
resources available to small entities;
    <bullet> performance standards rather than design standards;
    <bullet> simplification of reporting and compliance requirements 
(as, for example, through streamlined forms and electronic filing 
options);
    <bullet> different requirements for large and small firms; and
    <bullet> partial or total exemptions.
I further direct that whenever an executive agency chooses, for reasons 
other than legal limitations, not to provide such flexibility in a 
proposed or final rule that is likely to have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities, it should explicitly 
justify its decision not to do so in the explanation that accompanies 
that proposed or final rule.
Adherence to these requirements is designed to ensure that regulatory 
actions do not place unjustified economic burdens on small business 
owners and other small entities. If regulations are preceded by careful 
analysis, and subjected to public comment, they are less likely to be 
based on intuition and guesswork and more likely to be justified in 
light of a clear understanding of the likely consequences of alternative 
courses of action. With that understanding, agencies will be in a better 
position to protect the public while avoiding excessive costs and 
paperwork.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any

[[Page 330]]

party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. Nothing in this 
memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the 
functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in 
or in Relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire

On February 7, 2006, by Executive Order 13396, the President declared a 
national emergency, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the situation in or in relation to 
C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire and ordered related measures blocking the property 
of certain persons contributing to the conflict in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire. 
The situation in or in relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, which has been 
addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1572 of 
November 15, 2004, and subsequent resolutions, has resulted in the 
massacre of large numbers of civilians, widespread human rights abuses, 
significant political violence and unrest, and fatal attacks against 
international peacekeeping forces. Because the situation in or in 
relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on February 7, 2006, and 
the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must 
continue in effect beyond February 7, 2011. Therefore, in accordance 
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13396.

Notice of February 24, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by 
Proclamation 7757, the national emergency was extended and its scope was 
expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. 
The Cuban government has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the 
use of excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may engage 
in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. In addition, 
the unauthorized entry of any U.S.-registered vessel into Cuban 
territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of 
the United States. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the 
national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority 
relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set 
out in Proclamation 6867 as amended by Proclamation 7757.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a 
national emergency and blocked the property of persons undermining 
democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). He 
took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other 
persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. 
These actions and policies have contributed to the deliberate breakdown 
in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and 
intimidation in that country, and to political and economic instability 
in the southern African region.

[[Page 333]]

On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13391 to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13288 by ordering the blocking of the property of 
additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Zimbabwe.
On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13469, which 
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288 and ordered the blocking of the property of additional persons 
undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date, on November 22, 2005, and on July 25, 
2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 
6, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of March 4, 2011

Enhanced Collection of Relevant Data and Statistics Relating to Women

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
I am proud to work with the White House Council on Women and Girls, the 
Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of Commerce on this 
week's release of Women in America, a report detailing the status of 
American women in the areas of families and income, health, employment, 
education, and violence and crime. This report provides a snapshot of 
the status of American women today, serving as a valuable resource for 
Government officials, academics, members of non-profit, nongovernmental, 
and news organizations, and others.
My Administration is committed to ensuring that Federal programs achieve 
policy goals in the most cost-effective manner. The Women in America 
report, together with the accompanying website collection of relevant 
data, will assist Government officials in crafting policies in light of 
available statistical evidence. It will also assist the work of the 
nongovernmental sector, including journalists, public policy analysts, 
and academic researchers, by providing data that allow greater 
understanding of policies and programs.
Preparation of this report revealed the vast data resources of the 
Federal statistical agencies. It also revealed some gaps in data 
collection. Gathering

[[Page 334]]

and analyzing additional data to fill in the gaps could help 
policymakers gather a more accurate and comprehensive view of the status 
and needs of American women.
Accordingly, I hereby request the heads of executive departments and 
agencies, where possible within existing collections of data and in 
light of budgetary constraints, to identify and to seek to fill in gaps 
in statistics and improve survey methodology relating to women wherever 
appropriate, including in the broad areas covered by the Women in 
America report: families and income, health, employment, education, and 
violence and crime.
Examples of some of the efforts that could be undertaken by departments 
and agencies with respect to the gathering or design of comprehensive 
data related to women include the following:
(a) Maternal Mortality. I encourage the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS) to continue to work with States and other registration 
areas to complete the expeditious adoption of the most current standards 
for the collection of information on vital events, as well as the 
transition to electronic reporting systems. Maternal mortality is an 
important indicator of women's health both internationally and 
nationally. In the United States, maternal mortality statistics are 
based upon the information recorded on death certificates and collected 
by State and local vital records offices. The NCHS compiles the data 
across the 50 States and other registration areas. Due to concerns about 
data quality in the ascertainment of maternal mortality statistics, the 
2003 revision of the standard death certificate introduced improved 
standards for collecting data. Until all 50 States and registration 
areas adopt the new data standards, formulating a national-level 
maternal mortality ratio remains difficult.
(b) Women in Leadership in Corporate America. Women participate in every 
sector of the workforce. Their current role in corporate leadership is 
an important indicator of their progress. I encourage the Chair of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission to seek to supplement the information 
it already collects by seeking to collect, among other data, information 
on the presence of women in governance positions in corporations, in 
order to shed further light on the role of women in corporate America.
(c) Women in Leadership in Public Service. I encourage the Corporation 
for National and Community Service to include statistics about the role 
of women in diverse aspects of public service within its planned work on 
measuring civic engagement.
This memorandum shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law, 
consistent with the legal authorities of executive departments and 
agencies and subject to the availability of appropriations. Nothing in 
this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the 
authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; 
or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Notice of March 8, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued 
Executive Order 12959, imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat; on August 19, 1997, the President issued 
Executive Order 13059, consolidating and clarifying the previous orders; 
and on September 28, 2010, I issued Executive Order 13553 to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 12957.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2011. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is 
distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2010.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of March 11, 2011

Government Reform for Competitiveness and Innovation

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
As I outlined in my State of the Union address to the Congress on 
January 25, 2011, winning the future in the global economy will require 
reducing our deficit while investing in areas critical to long-term 
economic growth and competitiveness such as education, innovation, and 
infrastructure. By out-educating, out-innovating, and out-building our 
competitors, we will enable our Nation to grow, create jobs, and thrive 
in the years ahead.
At the same time, we cannot win the future with a government built for 
the past. We live and do business in the information age, but the 
organization of the Federal Government has not kept pace. Government 
agencies have grown without overall strategic planning and duplicative 
programs have sprung up, making it harder for each to reach its goals. 
Already, my Administration has taken on this waste and duplication. My 
current budget proposes more than 200 terminations, reductions, and 
savings in agency programs totaling approximately $30 billion in fiscal 
year 2012. And in areas as varied as surface transportation to job 
training, public health, and education, I have proposed to consolidate 
scores of programs into more focused, effective, and streamlined 
initiatives.
But we must go further. Winning the future will take a government that 
judiciously allocates scarce government resources to maximize its 
efficiency and effectiveness so that it can best support American 
competitiveness and innovation. Now is the time to act to consolidate 
and reorganize the executive branch of the Federal Government in a way 
that best serves this goal.
By this memorandum, I assign our Nation's first Chief Performance 
Officer, who also serves as the Deputy Director for Management of the 
Office of Management and Budget (the ``Chief Performance Officer''), the 
responsibility of leading the effort to create a plan for the 
restructuring and streamlining of the executive branch of the Federal 
Government. The first focus of this effort shall be on the executive 
departments and agencies and the functions that support one of our most 
important priorities--increasing trade, exports, and our overall 
competitiveness (``trade and competitiveness'').
Accordingly, I direct the following:

[[Page 339]]

(1) The Chief Performance Officer shall establish a Government Reform 
for Competitiveness and Innovation Initiative, led by an Executive 
Director, to conduct a comprehensive review of the Federal agencies and 
programs involved in trade and competitiveness, including analyzing 
their scope and effectiveness, areas of overlap and duplication, unmet 
needs, and possible cost savings.
(2) As part of this review, the Chief Performance Officer and Executive 
Director shall confer broadly with the heads and staff of executive 
departments and agencies, including the offices and agencies within the 
Executive Office of the President (collectively, the ``agencies''). They 
should also consult broadly with external stakeholders, including 
Members of Congress, business leaders, unions, nongovernmental 
organizations, and government reform experts, to hear their individual 
and independent perspectives on what we are doing well and where we 
could improve our effectiveness and efficiency.
(3) Within 90 days from the date of this memorandum, the Chief 
Performance Officer shall submit recommendations to me for presidential 
and, ultimately, congressional action to restructure and streamline 
Federal Government programs focused on trade and competitiveness, based 
on the following principles:
    (a) the functions of the executive branch of the Federal Government 
involved in trade and competitiveness should be organized so that the 
Federal Government can most efficiently and effectively facilitate the 
competitiveness of American businesses, large and small, and American 
workers in the changing global economy;
    (b) the responsibilities, authorities, programs, and requirements of 
agencies should be transparent, understandable, and easily accessible to 
the American public; and
    (c) agencies and programs should be organized to reduce 
inefficiencies and overlapping responsibilities or functions, maximize 
return on taxpayer dollars, and best serve the American public.
(4) Agencies shall provide, consistent with law, information and 
assistance requested by the Chief Performance Officer and Executive 
Director to inform their work as directed by this memorandum.
(5) Agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the 
extent permitted by law and consistent with their statutory and 
regulatory authorities and their enforcement mechanisms.
(6) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, 
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
(7) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby 
authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal 
Register.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Somalia

On April 12, 2010, by Executive Order 13536, I declared a national 
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the deterioration of the security situation and the 
persistence of violence in Somalia, and acts of piracy and armed robbery 
at sea off the coast of Somalia, which have repeatedly been the subject 
of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and violations of the 
Somalia arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council.
Because the situation with respect to Somalia continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on April 
12, 2010, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that 
emergency, must continue in effect beyond April 12, 2011. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50

declared in Executive Order 13536.

Delegation of Functions and Authority Under Sections 315 and 325 of 
Title 32, United States Code

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, I hereby delegate to you: (a) the functions and 
authority of the President contained in section 315 of title 32, United 
States Code, to permit a commissioned officer of the Regular Army or 
Regular Air Force to accept a commission in the Army National Guard or 
the Air National Guard, as the case may be, terminable at your 
discretion, without prejudicing his or her rank and without vacating his 
or her regular appointment; and (b) the functions and authority of the 
President contained in section 325 of title 32, United States Code, to 
authorize the service of an officer of the Army National Guard or the 
Air National Guard on active duty without relieving that officer from 
duty in the National Guard of his or her State, or of the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the United States Virgin Islands, or the 
District of Columbia and to give such authorization in advance for the 
purpose of establishing the succession of command of a unit.
This delegation of functions and authority supersedes and replaces the 
July 23, 2004, delegation to the Secretary of Defense of the functions 
and authority of the President contained in section 325 of title 32, 
United States Code.
You are further authorized and directed to make necessary arrangements 
to fund the exercise of these functions and authority from the proper 
appropriation, prescribe regulations to implement these functions and 
authority, and to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Drawdown Pursuant to Section 552(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as Amended, of up to $25 Million in Commodities and Services from 
any Agency of the United States Government for Libyan Groups, such as 
the Transitional National Council, To Support Efforts To Protect 
Civilians and Civilian-Populated Areas Under Threat of Attack in Libya

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by section 552(c)(2) 
of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a 
(FAA), I hereby determine that:
(1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of assistance 
under Chapter Six of Part II of the FAA in amounts in excess of funds 
otherwise available for such assistance is important to the national 
interests of the United States; and
(2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of 
assistance under Chapter Six of Part II of the FAA.
I therefore direct the drawdown of up to $25 million in nonlethal 
commodities and services from the inventory and resources of any agency 
of the United States Government to support key U.S. Government partners 
such as the Transitional National Council in efforts to protect 
civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this 
determination to the Congress, arrange for its publication in the 
Federal Register, and coordinate the implementation of this drawdown.

Notice of April 29, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of 
the Government of Syria

On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria 
Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Public 
Law 108-175, the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he 
declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the 
Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive 
Order 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and 
prohibited the exportation or reexportation of certain goods to Syria. 
On April 25, 2006, and February 13, 2008, the President issued Executive 
Order 13399 and Executive Order

[[Page 343]]

13460, respectively, to take additional steps with respect to this 
national emergency.
The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the 
Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-
existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and 
missile programs, and undermining U.S. and international efforts with 
respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.
The Syrian government has reduced the number of foreign fighters bound 
for Iraq--although the fighters have still created serious problems 
there--but its actions and policies, including continuing support for 
terrorist organizations, damaging the Lebanese government's ability to 
function, and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile 
programs, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As 
a result, the national emergency declared on May 11, 2004, and the 
measures adopted on that date, on April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 
13399, and on February 13, 2008, in Executive Order 13460, to deal with 
that emergency must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2011. Therefore, 
in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 
U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency 
declared with respect to certain actions of the Government of Syria. In 
addition, the United States condemns the use of violence against 
peacefully demonstrating citizens in Syria, and calls on the Syrian 
government to respect human rights and to forge a credible path to a 
future of greater freedom, democracy, opportunity, and justice. The 
United States will consider changes in the policies and actions of the 
Government of Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this 
national emergency in the future and would welcome progress by the 
Government of Syria on these matters. This notice shall be published in 
the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma

On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, certifying 
to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-208), that the Government of Burma had committed large-scale 
repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 
1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
United States persons contained in that section. The President also 
declared a national

[[Page 344]]

emergency to deal with the threat posed to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States by the actions and policies of the 
Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency in 
Executive Orders 13047 of May 20, 1997, 13310 of July 28, 2003, 13348 of 
October 18, 2007, and 13464 of April 30, 2008, must continue in effect 
beyond May 20, 2011.
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to Burma. This notice shall be published in the

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Stabilization 
of Iraq

On May 22, 2003, by Executive Order 13303, the President declared a 
national emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain 
other property in which Iraq has an interest, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The 
President took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq.
In Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 of 
July 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, and Executive 
Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, the President modified the scope of the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and took additional 
steps in response to this national emergency.
Because the obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13303, as modified in scope and 
relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Orders 13315, 13350, 
13364, and 13438, must continue in effect beyond May 22, 2011. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)),

Notice of June 14, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions and 
Policies of Certain Members of the Government of Belarus and Other 
Persons To Undermine Belarus Democratic Processes or Institutions

On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Belarus, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to 
undermine Belarus democratic processes or institutions; to commit human 
rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and 
disappearances; and to engage in public corruption, including by 
diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public 
authority.
The flawed December 2010 Presidential election in Belarus and its 
aftermath--the harsh violence against peaceful demonstrators; the 
continuing detention, prosecution, and imprisonment of opposition 
Presidential candidates and others; and the continuing repression of 
independent media and civil society activists--all show that the 
Government of Belarus has taken steps backward in the development of 
democratic governance and respect for human rights.
The actions and policies of the Government of Belarus and other persons 
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, the 
national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the measures adopted 
on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond 
June 16, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of June 17, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Usable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``order'') blocking property and interests in property of the Government 
of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of United States persons that are directly related 
to the implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation 
Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from 
Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related contracts and 
agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU Agreements 
allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived from 
nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial 
purposes. The order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of a large volume of weapons usable fissile material in the territory of 
the Russian Federation.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2011, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the risk of nuclear proliferation
created by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in the 
territory of the Russian Federation. This notice shall be published in 
the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of June 23, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea

On June 26, 2008, by Executive Order 13466, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary

[[Page 350]]

threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-
usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President also 
found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with 
respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to 
Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which terminated the exercise of 
authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) 
with respect to North Korea.
On August 30, 2010, I signed Executive Order 13551, which expanded the 
scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the continued 
actions and policies of the Government of North Korea.
On April 18, 2011, I signed Executive Order 13570 to take additional 
steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13466, and expanded in Executive Order 13551, to ensure the 
implementation of the import restrictions contained in United Nations 
Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874 and complement the import 
restrictions provided for in the Arms Export Control Act.
Because the existence and the risk of proliferation of weapons-usable 
fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of 
the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States, the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13466, expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551, and 
addressed further in Executive Order 13570, and the measures taken to 
deal with that national emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 
26, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western 
Balkans

On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of 
persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) 
extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the 
Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the 
Dayton Accords in Bosnia or

[[Page 351]]

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, in 
Kosovo. The President subsequently amended that order in Executive Order 
13304 of May 28, 2003.
Because the actions of persons threatening the peace and international 
stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
the United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and 
the measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that 
emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2011. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the Western Balkans.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Former 
Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor

On July 22, 2004, by Executive Order 13348, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures, including the blocking 
of the property of certain persons connected to the former Liberian 
regime of Charles Taylor, pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
former Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in 
particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their 
removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property, which 
have undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly 
development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions 
and resources.
The actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others have left a legacy 
of destruction that continues to undermine Liberia's transformation and 
recovery. Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on July 22, 2004, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond July 22, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13348.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Actions of 
Certain Persons to Undermine the Sovereignty of Lebanon or Its 
Democratic Processes and Institutions

On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic 
processes or institutions and certain other persons, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The 
President determined that the actions of certain persons to undermine 
Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic 
institutions; to contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of 
law in

[[Page 353]]

Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and 
intimidation; to reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian 
interference in Lebanon; or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese 
sovereignty and contribute to political and economic instability in that 
country and the region and constitute an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
Certain ongoing activities, such as continuing arms transfers to 
Hizballah that include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems, serve 
to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and economic 
instability in Lebanon, and continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared on August 1, 
2007, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, 
must continue in effect beyond August 1, 2011. In accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Colombia, that (1) 
interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in 
illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary, 
because of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to 
the national security of that country; and (2) that country has 
appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life 
in the air and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which 
shall at a minimum include effective means to identify and warn an 
aircraft before the use of force is directed against the aircraft.

Presidential Determination No. 2011-16 of September 15, 2011

 Presidential Determination on Major Illicit Drug Transit or Major 
Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2012

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228)(FRAA), I hereby identify the 
following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug 
producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, 
Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.
A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse 
reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of 
cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory 
definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth 
in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit 
drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of 
geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit 
or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous 
narcotics control law enforcement measures.
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, 
Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during 
the previous 12 months to make substantial efforts to adhere to their 
obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the 
measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Accompanying this 
report are justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and 
Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B).
I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 
706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Bolivia and 
Venezuela are vital to the national interests of the United States.
Afghanistan remains the world's largest producer of opium poppy and a 
major source of heroin. Primary trafficking routes from Afghanistan, 
where poppy cultivation is still mostly confined to the southern and 
western provinces, are through Iran to Turkey and Western Europe; 
through Pakistan to Africa, Asia, and the Middle East; and through 
Central Asia to the Russian Federation.
Helmand Province remains the largest grower of opium poppy in 
Afghanistan, but the Provincial Government's innovative Food Zone 
program, which provides farmers with wheat seed and fertilizer in 
exchange for a pledge not to grow poppy, coupled with credible law 
enforcement, has reduced Helmand's poppy cultivation by a third, to 
69,883 hectares in 2009 and even further to 65,043 hectares in 2010. The 
U.S.-funded Governor Led Eradication (GLE) program has demonstrated 
progress in Helmand with 2,111 hectares eradicated by the end of May 
2011. To date during 2011, a total of 3,827 hectares of GLE has been 
verified in 17 provinces throughout the country, an increase of more 
than 45 percent in eradication over the same time last year.

Although the amount of opium poppy cultivated in Pakistan is much less 
than Afghanistan, the country continues to qualify as a major drug 
producing country, with an estimated 1,700 hectares of opium poppy under 
cultivation. The country also remains a major transit country for 
opiates and hashish for markets around the world and is a transit 
country for precursor chemicals illegally smuggled to Afghanistan, where 
they are used to process heroin. Bilateral cooperation between Pakistan 
and the United States continues to support Pakistan's goal of returning 
to poppy-free status. United States Government support focuses 
especially on upgrading the institutional capacity of Pakistan's law 
enforcement agencies.
A number of indicators qualify the addition of El Salvador and Belize to 
the Majors List along with the remainder of Central American countries 
on the isthmus connecting South America to North America.
El Salvador, located between Guatemala and Nicaragua along the Pacific 
coastline and sharing an eastern border with Honduras, is subject to a 
number of factors making it vulnerable to the drug trade flowing to the 
United States from South America. The International Narcotics Control 
Board describes El Salvador as part of the so-called ``northern 
triangle'' with Guatemala and Honduras where ``national gangs are 
forming alliances with international criminal syndicates.'' According to 
the most recent U.S. interagency assessment of cocaine flows, the amount 
of this illicit substance passing through El Salvador destined directly 
for the United States was estimated at 4 metric tons in 2009.
The most recent U.S. assessment for Belize estimates the flow of drugs 
destined for the United States through this Central American country on 
the Caribbean coast at about 10 metric tons. Belize's vulnerability as a 
south-north avenue for the illegal narcotics trade is also demonstrated 
by recent drug and weapons seizures in Mexico along the border it shares 
with Belize. United States officials also report that drug control 
observers in Belize are increasingly concerned about the presence of 
drug trafficking organizations, including Los Zetas of Mexico, in the 
country's border areas and in coastal ports.
Considering the Central American region as a whole, the United States 
Government estimates that as much as 90 percent of some 700 metric tons 
of cocaine shipped annually from Colombia and other producing nations 
intended for the U.S. markets passes through the countries of Central 
America. This situation is an important element prompting the Central 
American Citizen Security Partnership, which I announced in March 2011. 
Through this partnership, the United States is working to refocus the 
impact of assistance through the Central American Regional Security 
Initiative (CARSI) and enhance the impact of complementary United States 
Government non-CARSI citizen safety and rule of law programs. Countries 
in the region are increasing coordination through the Central American 
Integration System, a combined effort to promote citizen security and 
economic prosperity, including programs aimed at thwarting the drug 
trade.
International documentation shows continued strengthening of illegal 
drug trafficking ties between South America and West Africa. West Africa 
is the closest point to South America for transatlantic purposes, and 
its close proximity to southern Europe provides a natural gateway to 
European drug

[[Page 359]]

markets. Porous borders, inadequate law enforcement, and corruption 
create a permissive environment for the illegal drug trade. West African 
linguistic connections among Brazil, Portugal, and Cape Verde may also 
contribute to narcotics trafficking.
According to the U.S. assessment of cocaine movement, about a third of 
cocaine destined for Europe passed through West Africa in 2009. The 2011 
U.N. World Drug Report also states there are reports that cocaine from 
Latin America is being stockpiled in some West African countries for 
future distribution to Europe in smaller quantities.
Despite the range of domestic challenges, including corruption, West 
African countries have begun to consider narcotics control as a top 
national security priority. For example, in 2010, Liberian law 
enforcement successfully uncovered and interdicted a cache of cocaine 
valued at $100 million. A number of U.S. projects in West Africa are 
aimed at improving drug interdiction and investigation capabilities. The 
assistance provided by international donors and organizations to West 
African governments to improve their counternarcotics capability is 
increasingly urgent. The United States welcomes fresh impetus in 2010 
and 2011 from the international community, especially the United Nations 
and the European Union, to make Africa a priority for drug-control 
assistance, to promote and protect the stability and positive growth of 
countries in Africa.
The stealth with which both marijuana and synthetic drugs such as MDMA 
(ecstasy) and methamphetamine are produced in Canada and trafficked to 
the United States makes it difficult to measure the overall impact of 
this smuggling. However, a special report prepared in May 2011 by the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration states that ``the threat posed by 
MDMA trafficking from Canada to and within the United States is 
significant.'' For example, in April 2011, a seizure of 20 pounds of 
MDMA from a Canada-based trafficking group was made by U.S. law 
enforcement in Plattsburg, New York. The United States pledges a more 
robust engagement and dialogue with Canada to reduce the shared problem 
of illegal drug trafficking. The results of this bilateral redoubling of 
drug-control cooperation will be considered in the framework of next 
year's Presidential Determination.
You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this determination 
under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish 
it in the Federal Register.

Notice of September 21, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Persons Who 
Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support Terrorism

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, the President declared 
a national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to

[[Page 360]]

commit, or support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted 
by the grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by 
foreign terrorists, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 
2001, in New York and Pennsylvania and against the Pentagon, and the 
continuing and immediate threat of further attacks against United States 
nationals or the United States. Because the actions of these persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date to 
deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23, 
2011. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to 
commit, or support terrorism.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of October 19, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant 
Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant 
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia and the extreme level of 
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States 
and abroad.
Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States and cause an extreme level of violence, 
corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad, the national 
emergency declared on October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted 
pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect 
beyond October 21, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics 
traffickers centered in Colombia.

the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), ordered related

the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States constituted by the situation in or in relation to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and 
atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability.
Because this situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared on October 27, 2006, and the measures adopted on that 
date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 
27, 2011. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National

Memorandum of October 28, 2011

Making It Easier for America's Small Businesses and America's Exporters 
To Access Government Services To Help Them Grow and Hire

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
As I outlined in my State of the Union address to the Congress on 
January 25, 2011, winning the future in the global economy will require 
a Government that wisely allocates its scarce resources to maximize 
efficiency and

[[Page 372]]

effectiveness so that it can best support American competitiveness, 
innovation, and job growth. If we are to thrive in the global economy, 
and make America the best place on Earth to do business, we need to 
equip our Government with the tools necessary to support innovation and 
job growth in the 21st century.
Accordingly, we must make it easier for businesses to access the full 
range of Government programs and services without having to waste effort 
navigating their way through the Federal bureaucracy. At the same time, 
we must further streamline and coordinate Federal programs to reduce 
costs and provide customer-oriented service.
Businesses looking for assistance from the Federal Government should 
feel like they are interacting with one entity, rather than a number of 
separate, albeit linked, components. This means adopting a ``No Wrong 
Door'' policy that uses technology to quickly connect businesses to the 
services and information relevant to them, regardless of which agency's 
website, call center, or office they go to for help.
In addition, a business's interactions with the Federal Government 
should be individualized and efficient. If the private sector can allow 
consumers to customize interactions so that they receive only the 
information they want, in the form they want it, so can the Federal 
Government.
Today, I am directing a first wave of changes focused on both small 
businesses and businesses of all sizes that want to begin or increase 
exporting (exporters), because those businesses help drive economic 
growth and have the most to gain from Federal assistance. We plan to use 
the resulting improvements as a model for future reforms so that, in 
time, all businesses and all citizens receive the highest level of 
customer service when they interact with the Federal Government.
Accordingly, I direct the following:
    (1) All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall work 
with a Steering Committee co-chaired by the Federal Chief Information 
Officer, Assistant to the President and Chief Technology Officer, and 
Chief Performance Officer (the Co-Chairs) to carry out the directives in 
this memorandum within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, unless a 
provision of this memorandum expressly states otherwise. The Steering 
Committee shall include senior policy and technical representatives, 
appointed by the heads of their respective agencies, from the 
Departments of State, Defense, Agriculture, Commerce, and Veterans 
Affairs, the Small Business Administration (SBA), the General Services 
Administration (GSA), the Export-Import Bank, and other agencies 
designated by the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chairs and representatives from the 
Department of Commerce and SBA shall serve as the Executive Committee of 
the Steering Committee, which shall coordinate the strategy, design, 
development, launch, and operation of BusinessUSA, a common, open, 
online platform and web service with dedicated resources that will, as a 
first step, disseminate core information regarding the Federal 
Government's programs and services relevant to small businesses and 
exporters.
    (2) Agencies shall work with the Steering Committee to develop and 
launch an introductory version of BusinessUSA. BusinessUSA shall be 
designed, tested, and built with the active feedback of U.S. businesses 
and relevant online communities. To the extent appropriate, practicable, 
and

[[Page 373]]

permitted by law, the BusinessUSA platform shall integrate related State 
and local government services as well as those of private sector 
partners.
    (3) Agencies shall make information regarding their small business 
and export programs and services accessible through BusinessUSA. To 
accomplish this in a uniform fashion, the Steering Committee shall 
develop a common set of standards for content available through 
BusinessUSA, which shall identify the types of programs and services to 
be included initially on BusinessUSA and a structure for organizing and 
presenting such information. These standards shall be used by all 
agencies in the creation, presentation, and delivery of information 
regarding their programs and services, to the extent practicable and 
permitted by law.
    (4) Agencies shall also work with the Steering Committee to develop 
new content for BusinessUSA that synthesizes information available 
across agencies to better serve small businesses and exporters. Among 
other things, agencies shall work together to aggregate on the 
BusinessUSA platform statistical, demographic, and other raw Government 
datasets of particular interest to small businesses and exporters, 
making Government data more easily accessible and spurring innovative 
uses of the data through business-oriented web or mobile applications.
    (5) Agencies shall integrate BusinessUSA, including ready access to 
the BusinessUSA website, into their current websites, call centers, and

Notice of November 1, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan

On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Sudan, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the 
Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, in Executive Order 13400, the 
President determined that the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States, expanded the scope of the national 
emergency to deal with that threat, and ordered the blocking of property 
of certain persons connected to the conflict. On October 13, 2006, the 
President issued Executive Order 13412 to take additional steps with 
respect to the national emergency and to implement the Darfur Peace and 
Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344).
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
November 3, 1997, as expanded on April 26, 2006, and with respect to 
which additional steps were taken on October 13, 2006, must continue in 
effect beyond November 3, 2011. Therefore, consistent with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Sudan.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of November 7, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in 
Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, 
and the process of implementing the agreements with Iran, dated January 
19, 1981, is still under way, the national emergency declared on 
November 14, 1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2011. 
Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year this national 
emergency with respect to Iran.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of November 9, 2011

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Weapons of Mass 
Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such 
weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13094 
amending Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the 
worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation 
activities. On June 28, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13382 
which, inter alia, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our 
ability to combat proliferation. The proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States; therefore, the national 
emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, and extended in each 
subsequent year, must continue. In accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended.

Memorandum of November 28, 2011

Managing Government Records

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Section 1. Purpose. This memorandum begins an executive branch-wide 
effort to reform records management policies and practices. Improving 
records management will improve performance and promote openness and 
accountability by better documenting agency actions and decisions. 
Records transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration 
(NARA) provide the prism through which future generations will 
understand and learn from our actions and decisions. Modernized records 
management will also help executive departments and agencies (agencies) 
minimize costs and operate more efficiently. Improved records management 
thus builds on Executive Order 13589 of November 9, 2011 (Promoting 
Efficient Spending), which directed agencies to reduce spending and 
focus on mission-critical functions.
When records are well-managed, agencies can use them to assess the 
impact of programs, to reduce redundant efforts, to save money, and to 
share knowledge within and across their organizations. In these ways, 
proper records management is the backbone of open Government.
Decades of technological advances have transformed agency operations, 
creating challenges and opportunities for agency records management. 
Greater reliance on electronic communication and systems has radically 
increased the volume and diversity of information that agencies must 
manage. With proper planning, technology can make these records less 
burdensome to manage and easier to use and share. But if records 
management policies and practices are not updated for a digital age, the 
surge in information could overwhelm agency systems, leading to higher 
costs and lost records.
We must address these challenges while using the opportunity to develop 
a 21st-century framework for the management of Government records. This 
framework will provide a foundation for open Government, leverage 
information to improve agency performance, and reduce unnecessary costs 
and burdens.
Sec. 2. Agency Commitments to Records Management Reform. (a) The head of 
each agency shall:

(i) ensure that the successful implementation of records management 
requirements in law, regulation, and this memorandum is a priority for 
senior agency management;

(ii) ensure that proper resources are allocated to the effective 
implementation of such requirements; and

[[Page 377]]

(iii) within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, designate in writing 
to the Archivist of the United States (Archivist), a senior agency official 
to supervise the review required by subsection (b) of this section, in 
coordination with the agency's Records Officer, Chief Information Officer, 
and General Counsel.

    (b) Within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, each agency head 
shall submit a report to the Archivist and the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) that:

(i) describes the agency's current plans for improving or maintaining its 
records management program, particularly with respect to managing 
electronic records, including email and social media, deploying cloud-based 
services or storage solutions, and meeting other records challenges;

(ii) identifies any provisions, or omissions, in relevant statutes, 
regulations, or official NARA guidance that currently pose an obstacle to 
the agency's adoption of sound, cost-effective records management policies 
and practices; and

(iii) identifies policies or programs that, if included in the Records 
Management Directive required by section 3 of this memorandum or adopted or 
implemented by NARA, would assist the agency's efforts to improve records 
management.

The reports submitted pursuant to this subsection should supplement, and 
therefore need not duplicate, information provided by agencies to NARA 
pursuant to other reporting obligations.
Sec. 3. Records Management Directive. (a) Within 120 days of the 
deadline for reports submitted pursuant to section 2(b) of this 
memorandum, the Director of OMB and the Archivist, in coordination with 
the Associate Attorney General, shall issue a Records Management 
Directive that directs agency heads to take specific steps to reform and 
improve records management policies and practices within their agency. 
The directive shall focus on:

(i) creating a Government-wide records management framework that is more 
efficient and cost-effective;

(ii) promoting records management policies and practices that enhance the 
capability of agencies to fulfill their statutory missions;

(iii) maintaining accountability through documentation of agency actions;

(iv) increasing open Government and appropriate public access to Government 
records;

(v) supporting agency compliance with applicable legal requirements related 
to the preservation of information relevant to litigation; and

(vi) transitioning from paper-based records management to electronic 
records management where feasible.

    (b) In the course of developing the directive, the Archivist, in 
coordination with the Director of OMB and the Associate Attorney 
General, shall review relevant statutes, regulations, and official NARA 
guidance to identify opportunities for reforms that would facilitate 
improved Government-wide records management practices, particularly with 
respect to electronic records. The Archivist, in coordination with the 
Director of OMB and the Associate Attorney General, shall present to the 
President the results of this

[[Page 378]]

review, no later than the date of the directive's issuance, to 
facilitate potential updates to the laws, regulations, and policies 
governing the management of Federal records.
    (c) In developing the directive, the Director of OMB and the 
Archivist, in coordination with the Associate Attorney General, shall 
consult with other affected agencies, interagency groups, and public 
stakeholders.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This memorandum shall be implemented 
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of 
appropriations.
    (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
Sec. 5. Publication. The Archivist is hereby authorized and directed to 
publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

hereby determine that it is necessary, in order to protect the national 
security interests of the United States, to suspend for a period of 6 
months the limitations set forth in sections 3(b) and 7(b) of the Act.
You are hereby authorized and directed to transmit this determination to 
the Congress, accompanied by a report in accordance with section 7(a) of 
the Act, and to publish the determination in the Federal Register.
This suspension shall take effect after the transmission of this 
determination and report to the Congress.

Memorandum of December 15, 2011

Determinations Under Section 1106(a) of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988--Russian Federation

Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Pursuant to section 1106(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act 
of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2905(a)), I determine that state trading enterprises 
account for a significant share of the exports of the Russian Federation 
(Russia) and goods that compete with imports into Russia. I further 
determine that such state trading enterprises unduly burden and 
restrict, or adversely affect, the foreign trade of the United States or 
of the U.S. economy, or are likely to result in such a burden, 
restriction, or effect.
Russia is seeking to become a member of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). The terms and conditions for Russia's accession to the WTO 
include Russia's commitments that it will ensure that state-owned and 
state-controlled enterprises, when engaged in commercial activity, will 
make purchases, which are not intended for governmental use, and sales 
in international trade in a manner consistent with applicable provisions 
of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization 
(WTO Agreement). In addition, Russia's state trading enterprises will 
make purchases and sales based solely on commercial considerations, 
e.g., price, quality, marketability, and availability, and that U.S. 
business firms will have an adequate opportunity to compete for sales to 
and purchases from these enterprises on non-discriminatory terms and 
conditions. The obligations that Russia will assume under the WTO 
Agreement, including Russia's protocol of accession, meet the 
requirements of section 1106(b)(2)(A) (19 U.S.C. 2905(b)(2)(A)), and 
thus my determinations under section 1106(a) do not require invocation 
of the non-application provisions of the WTO Agreement.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

    Washington, December 15, 2011.
Memorandum of December 21, 2011

Flexible Implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule

Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
Today's issuance, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), of the 
final Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule for power plants (the ``MATS

[[Page 380]]

Rule'') represents a major step forward in my Administration's efforts 
to protect public health and the environment.
This rule, issued after careful consideration of public comments, 
prescribes standards under section 112 of the Clean Air Act to control 
emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants from power plants, 
which collectively are among the largest sources of such pollution in 
the United States. The EPA estimates that by substantially reducing 
emissions of pollutants that contribute to neurological damage, cancer, 
respiratory illnesses, and other health risks, the MATS Rule will 
produce major health benefits for millions of Americans--including 
children, older Americans, and other vulnerable populations. Consistent 
with Executive Order 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), 
the estimated benefits of the MATS Rule far exceed the estimated costs.
The MATS Rule can be implemented through the use of demonstrated, 
existing pollution control technologies. The United States is a global 
market leader in the design and manufacture of these technologies, and 
it is anticipated that U.S. firms and workers will provide much of the 
equipment and labor needed to meet the substantial investments in 
pollution control that the standards are expected to spur.
These new standards will promote the transition to a cleaner and more 
efficient U.S. electric power system. This system as a whole is critical 
infrastructure that plays a key role in the functioning of all facets of 
the U.S. economy, and maintaining its stability and reliability is of 
critical importance. It is therefore crucial that implementation of the 
MATS Rule proceed in a cost-effective manner that ensures electric 
reliability.
Analyses conducted by the EPA and the Department of Energy (DOE) 
indicate that the MATS Rule is not anticipated to compromise electric 
generating resource adequacy in any region of the country. The Clean Air 
Act offers a number of implementation flexibilities, and the EPA has a 
long and successful history of using those flexibilities to ensure a 
smooth transition to cleaner technologies.
The Clean Air Act provides 3 years from the effective date of the MATS 
Rule for sources to comply with its requirements. In addition, section 
112(i)(3)(B) of the Act allows the issuance of a permit granting a 
source up to one additional year where necessary for the installation of 
controls. As you stated in the preamble to the MATS Rule, this 
additional fourth year should be broadly available to sources, 
consistent with the requirements of the law.
The EPA has concluded that 4 years should generally be sufficient to 
install the necessary emission control equipment, and DOE has issued 
analysis consistent with that conclusion. While more time is generally 
not expected to be needed, the Clean Air Act offers other important 
flexibilities as well. For example, section 113(a) of the Act provides 
the EPA with flexibility to bring sources into compliance over the 
course of an additional year, should unusual circumstances arise that 
warrant such flexibility.
To address any concerns with respect to electric reliability while 
assuring MATS' public health benefits, I direct you to take the 
following actions:
1. Building on the information and guidance that you have provided to 
the public, relevant stakeholders, and permitting authorities in the 
preamble of the MATS Rule, work with State and local permitting 
authorities to make

[[Page 381]]

the additional year for compliance with the MATS Rule provided under 
section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act broadly available to sources, 
consistent with law, and to invoke this flexibility expeditiously where 
justified.
2. Promote early, coordinated, and orderly planning and execution of the 
measures needed to implement the MATS Rule while maintaining the 
reliability of the electric power system. Consistent with Executive 
Order 13563, this process should be designed to ``promote predictability 
and reduce uncertainty,'' and should include engagement and coordination 
with DOE, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, State utility 
regulators, Regional Transmission Organizations, the North American 
Electric Reliability Corporation and regional electric reliability 
organizations, other grid planning authorities, electric utilities, and 
other stakeholders, as appropriate.
3. Make available to the public, including relevant stakeholders, 
information concerning any anticipated use of authorities: (a) under 
section 112(i)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act in the event that additional 
time to comply with the MATS Rule is necessary for the installation of 
technology; and(b) under section 113(a) of the Clean Air Act in the 
event that additional time to comply with the MATS Rule is necessary to 
address a specific and documented electric reliability issue. This 
information should describe the process for working with entities with 
relevant expertise to identify circumstances where electric reliability 
concerns might justify allowing additional time to comply.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec.  102.141-102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec.  102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec.  102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec.  102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec.  102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 389]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec.  102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec.  102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec.  102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

Sec.  102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec.  102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 791).
    (c) The Director, Facilities Management, Office of Administration, 
Executive Office of the President, shall be responsible for coordinating 
implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to the Director 
at the following address: Room 486, Old Executive Office Building, 17th 
and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.

[[Page 391]]

    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec.  102.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for
