              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2009), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2008 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2008 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 8215 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2008 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2009, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
     statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
 Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
   Division under the supervision of Gwendolyn J. Henderson. Michael J. 
                                           Forcina was the Chief Editor.

Proclamation 8215 of January 14, 2008

Religious Freedom Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Thomas Jefferson counted the freedom of worship as one of America's 
greatest blessings. He said it was ``a liberty deemed in other countries 
incompatible with good government, and yet proved by our experience to 
be its best support.'' On Religious Freedom Day, we celebrate the 1786 
passage of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom.
The freedom to worship according to one's conscience is one of our 
Nation's most cherished values. It is the first protection offered in 
the Bill of Rights: that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an 
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' 
In America, people of different faiths can live together united in 
peace, tolerance, and humility. We are committed to the proposition that 
as equal citizens of the United States of America, all are free to 
worship as they choose.
In an era during which an unprecedented number of nations have embraced 
individual freedom, we have also witnessed the stubborn endurance of 
religious repression. Religious freedom belongs not to any one nation, 
but to the world, and my Administration continues to support freedom of 
worship at home and abroad. On Religious Freedom Day and throughout the 
year, we recognize the importance of religious freedom and the vital 
role it plays in spreading liberty and ensuring human dignity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2008, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to reflect on the great 
blessing

[[Page 2]]

of religious liberty, endeavor to preserve this freedom for future 
generations, and commemorate this day with appropriate events and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.
GEORGE W. BUSH


<R05>

Proclamation 8216 of January 16, 2008

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., changed our Nation forever through his 
leadership, service, and clarity of vision. On the Martin Luther King, 
Jr., Federal Holiday, we honor the lasting legacy of this great 
American, remember the ideals for which he fought, and recommit 
ourselves to ensuring that our country's promise extends to all 
Americans across this great land.
In the brief time Dr. King walked upon this earth, he devoted his life 
to strengthening the content of the American character and called on our 
Nation to live up to its founding principles of life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness for all its citizens. Dr. King's faith in the 
Almighty gave him the courage to confront discrimination and 
segregation, and he preached that all the powers of evil are ultimately 
no match for even one individual armed with eternal truths. Through his 
determination, spirit, and resolve, Dr. King helped lift souls and lead 
one of the greatest movements for equality and freedom in history.
Our Nation has made progress toward realizing Dr. King's dream, yet the 
work to achieve liberty and justice for all is never-ending. In July of 
2006, I was honored to sign the ``Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and 
Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act 
of 2006,'' to renew the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and reaffirm our 
commitment to securing the voting rights of all Americans. My 
Administration will continue to protect the rights won through the 
sacrifice of Dr. King and other civil rights leaders, and our country 
will never rest until equality is real, opportunity is universal, and 
all citizens are empowered to realize their dreams.
As we observe Dr. King's birthday, I encourage all Americans to 
celebrate his memory by performing acts of kindness through service to 
others. Let us live out Dr. King's teachings as we continue to work for 
the day when the dignity and humanity of every person is respected.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 21, 2008, as the 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to 
observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service programs 
and activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy.

Proclamation 8217 of January 18, 2008

National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we recognize that each life has 
inherent dignity and matchless value, and we reaffirm our steadfast 
determination to defend the weakest and most vulnerable members of our 
society.
America was founded on the belief that all men are created equal and 
have an inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness, and our country remains committed to upholding that founding 
principle. Since taking office, I have signed legislation to help 
protect life at all stages, and my Administration will continue to 
encourage adoption, fund abstinence education and crisis pregnancy 
programs, and support faith-based groups. Today, as our society searches 
for new ways to ease human suffering, we must pursue the possibilities 
of science in a manner that respects the sacred gift of life and upholds 
our moral values.
Our Nation has made progress in its efforts to protect human life, and 
we will strive to change hearts and minds with compassion and decency. 
On National Sanctity of Human Life Day and throughout the year, we help 
strengthen the culture of life in America and work for the day when 
every child is welcomed in life and protected in law.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, January 20, 2008, 
as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. I call upon all Americans to 
recognize this day with appropriate ceremonies and to underscore our 
commitment to respecting and protecting the life and dignity of every 
human being.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8218 of January 28, 2008

National African American History Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National African American History Month, we honor the 
achievements and celebrate the rich heritage of African Americans.
Throughout our Nation's history, African Americans from all walks of 
life have offered their talents to the betterment of American society. 
Scholars such as Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. DuBois were early leaders 
who placed great importance on educating all people about the need for 
justice and racial equality. Athletes such as Jackie Robinson and Althea 
Gibson persevered while breaking the color barrier and competing at the 
highest levels of sports. Musicians like Nat King Cole and Billie 
Holiday lifted the American spirit with their creativity and musical 
gifts. Through their extraordinary accomplishments, these leaders helped 
bring our Nation closer to fulfilling its founding ideals.
This year's theme, ``Carter G. Woodson and the Origins of 
Multiculturalism,'' honors an educator who taught his fellow citizens 
about the traditions and contributions of African Americans. His 
dedication to educating Americans about cultural diversity initiated 
this celebration of African-American history. Our Nation is now stronger 
and more hopeful because generations of leaders like him have worked to 
help America live up to its promise of equality and the great truth that 
all of God's children are created equal.
Throughout African American History Month, we celebrate the many 
contributions African Americans have made to our Nation, and we are 
reminded of their courage in their struggle to change the hearts and 
minds of our citizens. While much progress has been made, we must 
continue to work together to achieve the promise and vision of our great 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2008 as National 
African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8219 of January 28, 2008

Sixth Anniversary of USA Freedom Corps, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

People across this great Nation have heard the universal call to love a 
neighbor and are using their time and talents to make a difference in 
the lives of others. On the sixth anniversary of the USA Freedom Corps, 
we celebrate the spirit of service in America and honor the volunteers 
whose good work represents the generous character of our country.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, I created the USA 
Freedom Corps to build on the countless acts of service, sacrifice, and 
generosity undertaken by our citizens. The USA Freedom Corps is 
dedicated to expanding volunteer service and extending the goodwill of 
the American people across our country and around the globe. By 
connecting individuals with volunteer opportunities, the USA Freedom 
Corps has helped ensure that millions of people have a chance to make a 
difference in the lives of those in need. The USA Freedom Corps also 
helps strengthen the non-profit sector and supports other national 
service programs and initiatives such as the Peace Corps, Citizen Corps, 
AmeriCorps, and Senior Corps. These efforts can help us build a more 
hopeful country and create a chain of compassion for generations to 
come.
Volunteers demonstrate kindness and touch lives. With hard work and 
dedication, volunteers help the less fortunate, respond to crises, 
mentor children, assist the elderly, and strengthen our communities. I 
urge all Americans to serve others and to learn more about service 
opportunities by visiting the USA Freedom Corps website at 
volunteer.gov. By providing help and hope to others, Americans can lead 
the world toward a more caring and compassionate tomorrow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 29, 2008, as the 
Sixth Anniversary of the USA Freedom Corps. I call upon the citizens of 
this great country to find ways to volunteer and to use their time, 
energy, and talents to help their fellow Americans, and I commend the 
efforts of the USA Freedom Corps and all those who answer the call to 
serve.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8220 of February 1, 2008

American Heart Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Heart disease is the number one killer of both men and women in the 
United States. As we observe American Heart Month, we renew our 
commitment to raising awareness of the serious impact of cardiovascular 
disease, and we encourage all citizens to take steps to help prevent it.
By exercising regularly, avoiding tobacco, limiting consumption of 
alcohol, following a nutritious diet, and monitoring high blood 
cholesterol and high blood pressure, we all can work to decrease the 
chances of developing cardiovascular disease. I urge all Americans to 
take advantage of regular screenings and consult their doctors about how 
to reduce their personal risk for heart disease.
In 2002, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, coordinating 
with other Federal agencies and national organizations, established the 
national campaign ``The Heart Truth'' to raise awareness among women of 
the dangers of cardiovascular disease. Today, more Americans are aware 
that it is the leading cause of death. The National Ambassador of ``The 
Heart Truth'' campaign, First Lady Laura Bush, continues to lead the 
Federal Government's efforts to send the urgent message to women about 
their risk for heart disease. Through this campaign, millions of women 
across the country have come to recognize the red dress as an important 
reminder to make healthy choices for their heart and encourage others to 
do the same.
During American Heart Month, we express our gratitude to the dedicated 
medical professionals, researchers, and others whose tireless efforts 
help save lives and make a difference for countless Americans. As we 
work together to fight this deadly disease, we recognize that every 
person can take action to reduce his or her risk for heart disease and 
make the decision to live a healthier life.
In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has 
requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating 
February as ``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2008 as American Heart Month, and I 
invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 
1, 2008. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and 
reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8221 of February 28, 2008

American Red Cross Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 1881, Clara Barton established the American Red Cross, and for years 
afterward, she led that organization in its noble cause to provide 
healing, comfort, and hope to those in need. Today, her legacy lives on 
through the millions of individuals who have answered the timeless call 
to serve others. During American Red Cross Month, we honor this 
charitable organization, and we reflect on its remarkable achievements 
and contributions to our country.
The American Red Cross exemplifies the good heart of this Nation by 
leading humanitarian efforts at home and around the world. This past 
year the American Red Cross provided food, comfort, and medical 
assistance to the victims of the tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota, 
the devastating wildfires in California, and the tornadoes that affected 
several Southern States. From the mountains of Peru to the lowlands of 
Bangladesh, the American Red Cross and its partners helped to provide 
relief abroad to those affected by natural disasters and humanitarian 
emergencies.
The American Red Cross also helps provide vital assistance by organizing 
blood drives, teaching health and safety programs, and providing 
lifesaving supplies. By compassionately supporting our men and women in 
uniform and their families, it helps to lift the spirits of our wounded 
warriors. During this month, we send our heartfelt gratitude to the 
volunteers and staff of the American Red Cross.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim March 2008 as American Red Cross Month. I 
commend the dedicated efforts of the American Red Cross, and I encourage 
all Americans to help make our world a better place by volunteering 
their time, energy, and talents for others.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8222 of February 28, 2008

Save Your Vision Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Early diagnosis and proper treatment of eye disease can help preserve 
the gift of sight. During Save Your Vision Week, we encourage Americans 
to receive routine vision screenings and to understand the importance of 
keeping their eyes healthy and safe.
Today, millions of Americans live with some form of eye disease, such as 
glaucoma, corneal disease, macular degeneration, or diabetic eye 
disease. Individuals can help to avoid these diseases and maintain 
healthy eyes by following good eating habits, using appropriate 
protective eyewear, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Citizens should 
discuss with their physician the dangers of eye disease and see that 
their children are tested before their first year of school.
My Administration will continue to seek better ways to prevent and treat 
eye diseases. The National Eye Institute's website, www.nei.nih.gov, 
provides many resources to help Americans find information on eye 
disease and on where to find local eye-care professionals. By being 
proactive, Americans can help prevent vision loss and live healthier 
lives.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended 
(77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and requested the 
President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as ``Save 
Your Vision Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 2 through March 8, 2008, as Save Your 
Vision Week. I encourage all Americans to learn more about eye care and 
eye safety and to take measures to help ensure a lifetime of healthy 
vision.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8223 of February 29, 2008

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since the earliest days of our Republic, Irish Americans have enriched 
our culture with their faith, values, and hard work. During the month of 
March, we celebrate the contributions of Americans who trace their 
ancestry back to Ireland's shores.

[[Page 9]]

Many of the sons and daughters of Erin came to America fleeing famine 
and poverty. They came with dreams of opportunity, and they helped to 
build our democracy and advance the cause of liberty. Irish Americans in 
all walks of life have made lasting contributions to our Nation, and we 
honor the service of Irish Americans in America's Armed Forces. 
Throughout our history, those claiming Irish ancestry have helped shape 
and strengthen America, including as signers of the Declaration of 
Independence and as Presidents of the United States.
This month, we celebrate the patriotic and proud people who originated 
from the Emerald Isle and who have played a vital role in the story of 
this Nation of immigrants.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2008 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by celebrating the contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8224 of February 29, 2008

National Consumer Protection Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As we face new challenges in the 21st century, we must work to ensure 
that Americans are kept safe in the marketplace. During National 
Consumer Protection Week, as my Administration works with Congress to 
improve our consumer product safety system, we also encourage Americans 
to make informed financial decisions and take advantage of the resources 
that can help them become responsible consumers, savers, and investors.
This year's theme for National Consumer Protection Week, ``Financial 
Literacy: A Sound Investment,'' encourages consumers to take steps to 
build a firm financial foundation. By becoming informed consumers, 
individuals can help plan for their future, protect their identity, and 
effectively manage their finances. It is important for citizens to be 
knowledgeable on financial matters such as choosing a health insurance 
plan, comparing savings and retirement plans, and realizing how credit 
scores can affect them. Education is the first line of defense in 
helping consumers manage their money wisely and safeguard themselves 
against fraud and identity theft.
My Administration is working to expand the American people's financial 
education. In January of this year, I signed an Executive Order 
establishing the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy. 
This Council will help keep America competitive and assist Americans in 
understanding and addressing financial matters. By visiting consumer.gov 
and mymoney.gov,

[[Page 10]]

Americans can discover the tools they need to make financial decisions 
and be successful in today's marketplace.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2 through March 8, 
2008, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon Government 
officials, industry leaders, and consumer advocates to make available 
information about how citizens can help to prevent fraud and identity 
theft, and I encourage all Americans to gain the financial literacy they 
need to compete in the 21st century.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Women's History Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Women's History Month, we celebrate the courage, foresight, and 
resolve of women who have strengthened our democracy.
America has been transformed by strong women whose contributions shaped 
the history of our country. Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly 
solo across the Atlantic, and she inspired generations of women to 
follow their dreams. Physicist Chien-Shiung Wu helped advance our 
knowledge and understanding of the world through her achievements in 
atomic research. Harriet Tubman fought racial injustice and opened doors 
for more Americans to participate fully in our society.
Today, women are continuing this legacy of leadership as entrepreneurs, 
doctors, teachers, scientists, lawyers, artists, and public officials. 
They are also providing guidance and care to their loved ones and 
strengthening America's families and communities. We also remember the 
women of the United States Armed Forces who are serving our country with 
honor and distinction across the world.
This month, we honor the extraordinary women of our Nation's past and 
recognize the countless women who are demonstrating leadership in every 
aspect of American life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2008 as Women's 
History Month. I call upon all our citizens to observe this month with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the history, 
accomplishments, and contributions of American women.

Proclamation 8226 of March 14, 2008

National Poison Prevention Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since 1962, National Poison Prevention Week has helped to raise 
awareness about the dangers of potentially poisonous medicines and 
household chemicals. During this week, we underscore our commitment to 
protect our fellow citizens from accidental poisonings and to educate 
families about the preventive steps that can be taken to ensure the 
safety of our young people.
More than 2 million poisonings are reported each year across the 
country. In order to help prevent these poisonings, parents should place 
household chemicals out of the reach of children, keep items in their 
original containers, and read the labels and dosages on all products 
thoroughly before use. Installing carbon monoxide alarms in homes to 
help monitor air quality can also save lives.
To learn more about the ways to keep children safe and help prevent 
poisonings, I encourage all Americans to visit the Poison Prevention 
Week Council website at poisonprevention.org. In case of an emergency, 
individuals can contact the nearest Poison Control Center 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week at 1-800-222-1222. By taking precautions, properly 
supervising children, and knowing what to do in an emergency, we can 
protect the health and well-being of more Americans.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 16 through March 22, 2008, as National 
Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week 
by participating in appropriate activities and by learning how to 
prevent poisonings.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8227 of March 20, 2008

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Greek Independence Day, we recognize the important contributions 
Greek Americans have made to our national character, celebrate the deep 
friendship between our two countries, and honor the anniversary of the 
Greek call for independence.
 The United States and Greece share a close relationship based on our 
common belief in the power of freedom. The ancient Athenians gave birth 
to the principles of democracy, and America's Founding Fathers were 
inspired by Greek ideals that honored and respected human dignity and 
rights. When the people of Greece claimed their independence in 1821, 
they had the strong support of the United States. Greek patriots risked 
their lives because they knew freedom and democracy were both their 
proud legacy and their ultimate destiny. Today, our nations remain 
allies in the cause of freedom and are working to lay the foundations of 
peace and spread the blessings of liberty around the world.
 In celebrating Greek Independence Day, we commemorate the heritage of 
freedom our countries hold dear, and we remember the Greek Americans 
whose strong spirit, resolve, and courage helped shape America.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2008, as Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8228 of March 28, 2008

To Modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and for 
Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 
(the ``1988 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States 
International Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') to keep the 
Harmonized Tariff

[[Page 13]]

Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous review and 
periodically to recommend to the President such modifications to the HTS 
as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to accomplish the 
purposes set forth in that subsection. In 2006, the Commission 
recommended modifications to the HTS pursuant to section 1205 of the 
1988 Act to conform the HTS to amendments made to the International 
Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System 
(the ``Convention''). In Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 
2006, I modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 
U.S.C. 3006(a)) to conform the HTS to the Convention.
2. The Commission has recommended further modifications to the HTS 
pursuant to sections 1205(a) and (d) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(a) 
and (d)) to alleviate unnecessary administrative burdens, and to ensure 
that the prior modifications proclaimed in Proclamation 8097 maintain 
substantial rate neutrality.
3. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act authorizes the President to proclaim 
modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission 
under section 1205 of the 1988 Act, if he determines that the 
modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the 
Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of 
the United States. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS 
proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 
Act are in conformity with United States obligations under the 
Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of 
the United States.
4. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement with respect to the United 
States, and Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, 
implemented the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement with 
respect to the United States. In Presidential Proclamation 8097, I 
proclaimed modifications to the HTS that I determined were necessary or 
appropriate to continue to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in 
Proclamations 7746 and 7747.
5. In Presidential Proclamation 8214 of December 27, 2007, I further 
modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act to ensure 
the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded 
originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 
and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamations 7746 
and 7747. Technical rectifications to the HTS are required to provide 
the intended tariff treatment.
6. On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican 
Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) 
with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Congress approved the CAFTA-DR in section 
101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free 
Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``CAFTA-DR Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
4011).

[[Page 14]]

7. Sections 321-328 of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4081-4088) authorize 
the President to take certain actions in response to a request by an 
interested party for relief from serious damage or actual threat thereof 
to a domestic industry producing certain textile or apparel articles. I 
assigned certain functions under these provisions to the Committee for 
the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) in Proclamation 7987 of 
February 28, 2006.
8. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established CITA, 
consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, 
Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as 
Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. 
Consistent with 3 U.S.C. 301, when carrying out functions vested in the 
President by statute and assigned by the President to CITA, the 
officials collectively exercising those functions are all to be officers 
required to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of 
the Senate.
9. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting 
import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, 
modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other 
import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 1206 of the 1988 Act, sections 321-328 of the CAFTA-DR Act, 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the Trade 
Act do proclaim that:
(1) In order to modify the HTS to conform it to the Convention or any 
amendment thereto recommended for adoption, to promote the uniform 
application of the Convention, to establish additional subordinate 
tariff categories, and to make technical and conforming changes to 
existing provisions, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I to this 
proclamation.
(2) In order to provide the intended tariff treatment to imports of 
originating goods from Chile, the HTS is modified as set out in section 
A of Annex II to this proclamation.
(3) In order to provide the intended tariff treatment to imports of 
originating goods from Singapore, the HTS is modified as set out in 
section B of Annex II to this proclamation.
(4) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under sections 321-

Proclamation 8229 of April 1, 2008

Cancer Control Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Cancer Control Month, we honor cancer victims and survivors, 
raise awareness of the impact cancer has on our citizens, and underscore 
our commitment to battling this deadly disease.
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States, and we 
remain committed to making the medical advances necessary to prevent and 
treat this disease. Scientists and medical professionals have made great 
progress in developing innovative treatments, improving diagnostic 
tools, and increasing our understanding of cancer. These advances have 
helped people with cancer live longer, healthier lives.
All Americans can reduce their risk of developing cancer by following 
healthy eating habits, exercising regularly, avoiding tobacco and 
excessive use of alcohol, and controlling their weight. By scheduling 
regular physicals, getting preventive health screenings, and being aware 
of their family history, individuals who do develop cancer can increase 
the likelihood that it will be discovered at an earlier and more 
treatable stage. I encourage all our citizens to talk to their doctors 
and learn more about preventive measures that can save lives.
My Administration remains dedicated to finding a cure for cancer. Since 
2005, the Cancer Genome Atlas has played a role in advancing cancer 
research, and it is helping scientists learn more about the genetic 
sources of cancer. We continue to support the innovative advances needed 
to bring hope to those affected, and we will continue to fight cancer.
As we observe Cancer Control Month, we honor cancer survivors for their 
determination, courage, and strength, and we remember those who lost 
their valiant fight against cancer. Their stories are an inspiration to 
all Americans. We also recognize medical professionals, researchers, 
family members, and friends who help support cancer patients. Their 
efforts improve the quality of life for those suffering from cancer, and 
their compassion embodies the true spirit of our Nation.
The Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved March 
28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103), as amended, has requested the 
President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April as ``Cancer 
Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 2008 as Cancer Control Month. I 
encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
raise awareness about how all Americans can prevent and control cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8230 of April 1, 2008

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Children are the hope and promise of our Nation, and our society has a 
special duty to ensure young Americans get the care and attention they 
need to succeed in life. During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 
we underscore our commitment to preventing child abuse and neglect so 
that all children can live in safety and security.
Parents have a responsibility to safeguard their children from danger 
and to provide the love, protection, and guidance youngsters need to 
grow into confident and caring adults. In every community across the 
Nation, good and courageous citizens are improving the lives of our most 
vulnerable children with acts of compassion. The strength of America 
lies in the ability of our citizens to make a positive difference in the 
lives of our young people.
My Administration is committed to the safety of our Nation's youth. In 
2006, I signed into law the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, 
which was designed to protect children from sexual and other violent 
crimes, help prevent child pornography, and make the Internet safer for 
our children. This law expands sex offender registration and 
notification on a nationwide basis, provides a statutory basis for the 
Project Safe Childhood program, and gives communities and law 
enforcement the tools necessary to keep children out of harm's way. 
Additionally, with strengthened Federal penalties, we will ensure that 
those who prey on our children will be caught, prosecuted, and punished 
to the fullest extent of the law.
As we observe National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we reaffirm our 
loving commitment to America's youth and our dedication to building a 
society in which all children can realize their full potential.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2008 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I encourage all citizens to help protect 
our children from abuse and neglect and to take an active role in 
creating safe communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8231 of April 1, 2008

National Donate Life Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every human life has matchless value, and during National Donate Life 
Month, we reaffirm our commitment to raising awareness about the 
importance of organ donation. We also express our appreciation to those 
who have donated organs, tissue, and marrow.
Thousands of Americans are currently on the waiting list for an organ or 
tissue transplant. I urge all Americans to register with their State's 
donor registry; fill out, sign, and carry an organ donor card; say yes 
to organ donation on their driver's license; and share their decision 
with family and friends. By taking these steps, Americans can help save 
lives. My Administration is committed to strengthening organ and tissue 
donation programs and awareness activities. Just last year, I was 
pleased to sign the ``Charlie W. Norwood Living Organ Donation Act,'' 
which helps match more donors with those in need of transplants. The 
kindness and generosity of donors reflect the compassionate spirit of 
our Nation.
During National Donate Life Month, we celebrate the life-saving work of 
medical professionals and researchers and the many others whose actions 
reflect our commitment to a brighter tomorrow. Individuals can visit 
organdonor.gov to learn more about organ and tissue donation and how 
they can give the gift of life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2008 as National 
Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, 
educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and 
private organizations to help raise awareness of the urgent need for 
organ and tissue donors throughout our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8232 of April 1, 2008

National Fair Housing Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Fair Housing Month, our Nation commemorates the 40th 
anniversary of the Fair Housing Act and reaffirms our dedication to 
maintaining equal access to housing for every American.

[[Page 22]]

On April 11, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Fair Housing 
Act. This important legislation was one of a series of civil rights laws 
that sought to secure the rights of individuals and extend the full 
blessings of liberty to all Americans. The Fair Housing Act prohibits 
discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing and, in 
doing so, furthers the ideals championed by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
and other heroes of the civil rights movement.
Our Nation has come a long way, yet our journey to justice is not 
complete. While the housing market works through this difficult period, 
my Administration remains steadfast in its commitment to help 
responsible homeowners, to end discrimination, and to work to ensure 
that all citizens have access to housing. During National Fair Housing 
Month, we acknowledge our responsibility to ensure that all Americans 
enjoy the opportunities that this great land of liberty offers.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2008 as National 
Fair Housing Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn 
more about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8233 of April 4, 2008

National Tartan Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans of Scottish descent have made enduring contributions to our 
Nation with their hard work, faith, and values. On National Tartan Day, 
we celebrate the spirit and character of Scottish Americans and 
recognize their many contributions to our culture and our way of life.
Scotland and the United States have long shared ties of family and 
friendship, and many of our country's most cherished customs and ideals 
first grew to maturity on Scotland's soil. The Declaration of Arbroath, 
the Scottish Declaration of Independence signed in 1320, embodied the 
Scots' strong dedication to liberty, and the Scots brought that 
tradition of freedom with them to the New World. Sons and daughters of 
many Scottish clans were among the first immigrants to settle in 
America, and their determination and optimism helped build our Nation's 
character. Several of our Founding Fathers were of Scottish descent, as 
have been many Presidents and Justices of the United States Supreme 
Court. Many Scottish Americans, such as Andrew Carnegie, were great 
philanthropists, founding and supporting numerous scientific, 
educational, and civic institutions. From the evocative sounds of the 
bagpipes to the great sport of golf, the Scots have also left an 
indelible mark on American culture.

[[Page 23]]

National Tartan Day is an opportunity to celebrate all Americans who 
claim Scottish ancestry, and we are especially grateful for the service 
in our Armed Forces of Scottish Americans who have answered the call to 
protect our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 6, 2008, as National 
Tartan Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day by celebrating 
the continued friendship between the people of Scotland and the United 
States and by recognizing the contributions of Scottish Americans to our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8234 of April 8, 2008

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America is blessed to have brave men and women willing to step forward 
to defend our freedoms and keep us safe. The members of the United 
States Armed Forces have proudly held fast against determined and 
ruthless enemies, protected our citizens from harm, and freed millions 
from oppression. On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we 
pay tribute to the courageous and selfless individuals who were taken 
captive while serving the cause of peace and securing liberty across the 
globe.
America's former prisoners of war set an example of vision, valor, and 
unshakeable love of country that inspires our citizens. Through 
unspeakable conditions, they upheld their oath to defend America with 
honor and dignity. Their extraordinary spirit, patriotism, and resolve 
helped defeat tyranny and build democratic and just societies, enabling 
decent men and women around the world to live in freedom.
Our Nation is extremely proud of our former prisoners of war, and we owe 
them and their families a debt we can never fully repay. On National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we honor our country's heroes 
who were prisoners of war, recognize their sacrifice, and express our 
deepest gratitude to those who helped write a more hopeful chapter in 
our history.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2008, as National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon the people of the 
United States to join me in honoring the service and sacrifices of all 
of

[[Page 24]]

America's former prisoners of war. I call upon Federal, State, and local 
government officials and private organizations to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8235 of April 9, 2008

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For 25 years, Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) has given 
school children across America an opportunity to gain the skills they 
need to avoid involvement in drugs, gangs, and violence. On National 
D.A.R.E. Day, we recognize those individuals who teach America's 
children how to resist peer pressure and live productive, drug-free, and 
violence-free lives.
Millions of our Nation's young people have learned about the dangerous 
effects of drug abuse with the help of the D.A.R.E. program. Parents, 
law enforcement officials, teachers, and counselors are on the front 
lines of this effort and are sending our kids a clear message that drug 
use is dangerous and unacceptable. In classrooms across the country, 
police officers are answering students' tough questions about drugs and 
crime and encouraging an open line of communication between students and 
law enforcement.
My Administration is committed to reducing drug use among young people, 
and we are working to cut the supply of drugs coming into our country 
and fight demand here at home. Additionally, we are helping spread the 
message of drug prevention through the National Youth Anti-Drug Media 
Campaign and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. The Helping 
America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, is working 
with community leaders to address challenges facing young people on a 
daily basis. These and other efforts are helping to combat the 
destructive cycle of drug addiction.
All Americans have a responsibility to encourage others to turn away 
from drug abuse and to make good choices in life. During National 
D.A.R.E. Day, we renew our commitment to providing our youth the 
knowledge and encouragement they need to resist the pressures that can 
lead them to experiment with drugs and violent activities. By working 
together, we can help our children build lives of purpose and strengthen 
our communities, one heart and one soul at a time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10, 2008, as 
National D.A.R.E. Day. I urge all young people to make right choices and 
call upon all Americans to recognize our collective responsibility to 
combat every

[[Page 25]]

form of drug abuse and to support all those who work to help our 
children avoid drug use and violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8236 of April 10, 2008

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Pan American Day and during Pan American Week, we underscore the 
importance of a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous Western Hemisphere 
where our common values continue to strengthen friendships, advance 
freedom, and encourage fair trade.
The love of liberty is deeply rooted in our hemisphere. In the earliest 
days of our Republic, the people of the United States inspired patriots 
throughout the Americas to take their own stand for independence. Today, 
the decent and honorable people of both American continents are united 
in the desire for freedom and democracy. The United States stands with 
those who respect human rights and those who seek to bring change and 
hope to their countries. We look forward to the day when all of the 
Americas are wholly free and democratic.
My Administration remains committed to helping our friends as they 
advance the cause of justice and economic opportunity throughout the 
Western Hemisphere. Through Millennium Challenge Compacts, we support 
development in countries that govern justly, invest in their people, and 
promote economic freedom. In addition, the Dominican Republic-Central 
America-United States Free Trade Agreement, signed in 2005, has opened 
markets and created opportunities for American businesses, strengthened 
economic ties with our neighbors to the south, and brought hope to 
people so that they can better care for themselves and for their 
families. In December of 2007, I signed the United States-Peru Trade 
Promotion Agreement Implementation Act to bring economic gains for both 
of our countries, empower workers, and foster accountability and the 
rule of law. We seek to build on these successes by working with the 
Congress to approve the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement 
and the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement. These and other 
free trade agreements enhance prosperity in the United States and signal 
our firm support for those who share our values of freedom and 
democracy.
As we recognize Pan American Day and Pan American Week, we will continue 
to work together to advance our common interests and build a future in 
which opportunity reaches into every community.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2008, as Pan

[[Page 26]]

American Day and April 13 through April 19, 2008, as Pan American Week. 
I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the 
United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of April,

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Crime Victims' Rights Week we highlight our dedication 
to protecting and strengthening the rights of crime victims and their 
families.
My Administration is committed to providing services and resources for 
victims of crime so that they can find justice, hope, and healing in 
their lives. To assist victims of domestic violence and their children, 
my Family Justice Center Initiative established comprehensive support 
centers in communities across the country. Through the Justice for All 
Act of 2004, we expanded DNA testing and enhanced the scope and 
enforceability of crime victims' rights. In 2006, I signed into law the 
Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act to expand the National Sex 
Offender Registry, increase Federal penalties for crimes against 
children, and protect our children while on the Internet. I also support 
a Crime Victims' Rights Amendment to the Constitution. Through these and 
other efforts, we can better protect our citizens and our communities.
During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we recognize the advocates, 
counselors, and others who assist victims in their time of need, and the 
law enforcement personnel who work to bring offenders to justice. To 
learn more about victims' rights, Americans can visit 
www.crimevictims.gov. By working together, we can help protect crime 
victims and build a society that respects the life and value of every 
person.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 13 through April 19, 
2008, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I encourage all Americans 
to promote awareness of victims' rights and advance this important 
cause.

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A hopeful society helps ensure that its citizens develop the character, 
knowledge, and skills they need to succeed. On Education and Sharing 
Day, we underscore our dedication to encouraging our Nation's youth to 
build a solid foundation for a lifetime of accomplishment.
Education and Sharing Day pays tribute to the unique efforts of Rabbi 
Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe. The Rebbe helped 
create numerous education and outreach centers, which continue to 
provide social service programs and humanitarian aid at home and around 
the globe.
On this day and throughout the year, we encourage our children to set 
high goals, make the right choices, and put character first. By 
instilling respect, responsibility, civic duty, compassion, and honesty 
in our youth, we can help more of our citizens realize the great promise 
of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 16, 2008, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon government officials, 
educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to reach 
out to young people and work to create a better, brighter, and more 
hopeful future for all.

National Park Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, ``There is nothing so 
American as our National Parks.'' During National Park Week, we 
underscore our commitment to conserving these magnificent places and 
recognize the many employees and volunteers who give their time and 
energy to keep them beautiful for all Americans to enjoy.
This year's theme for National Park Week, ``Kids In Parks,'' highlights 
youth programs and initiatives offered by the National Park Service to 
encourage children to be good stewards of the land. The Junior Ranger 
program is one such program that encourages America's youth to explore, 
protect, and learn about our national parks. Today, many national parks 
have

[[Page 28]]

active Junior Ranger programs. By visiting nps.gov/webrangers, young 
people can sign up to become WebRangers, enabling them to learn about 
different parks, monuments, and historic sites right from their homes.
Across the United States, the Federal Government plays a vital role in 
protecting our natural and historical treasures. My Administration 
launched the National Park Centennial Initiative to preserve and enhance 
these scenic wonders and to prepare for the 100th anniversary of the 
National Park Service in 2016. Serving as the Honorary Chair of the 
National Park Foundation, First Lady Laura Bush has also played a 
significant role in preserving our national parks. The First Lady is 
actively involved in programs such as First Bloom, which teaches 
children how to preserve native plants across America. In addition, this 
past Christmas, the White House highlighted our national parks with the 
theme ``Holiday in the National Parks.''
Our National Parks belong to each of us, and they are natural places to 
learn, exercise, volunteer, spend time with family and friends, and 
enjoy the magnificent beauty of our great land. During National Park 
Week and throughout the year, Americans of all ages can pledge to help 
maintain and enhance America's national treasures for future 
generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19 through April 27, 
2008, as National Park Week. I invite all my fellow citizens to join me 
in celebrating America's national parks by visiting these wonderful 
spaces, discovering all they have to offer, and becoming active 
participants in park conservation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

the Generalized System of Preferences and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) 
(AGOA), authorizes the President to designate a country listed in 
section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets the 
eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 
3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).

[[Page 29]]

2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an ``eligible sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.
3. Section 112(c) of the AGOA, as amended in section 6002 of the Africa 
Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (Division D, Title VI, Public Law 109-
432) (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)), provides special rules for certain apparel 
articles imported from ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries.''
4. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 
1974 Act, I have determined that the Republic of Togo (Togo) meets the 
eligibility requirements set forth or referenced therein, and I have 
decided to designate Togo as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and 
as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
5. I further determine that Togo satisfies the criterion for treatment 
as a ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country'' under 
section 112(c)(5)(D) of the AGOA, as amended.
6. Presidential Proclamation 8114 of March 19, 2007, implemented section 
112 of the AGOA, as amended. Technical corrections to the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) are necessary to implement 
the intended tariff treatment.
7. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461, 
2462(a)), the President is authorized to designate countries as 
beneficiary developing countries, and to designate any beneficiary 
developing country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country, 
for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.

the Solomon Islands as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of 
the GSP program. Pursuant to section 502(a)(2) of the 1974 Act, and 
having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I 
have determined that the Solomon Islands should be designated as a 
least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP 
program.
9. In calendar year 2006, imports from Jamaica under subheading 
2202.90.37 of the HTS exceeded the relevant competitive need limitation

503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, where imports of articles exceed the 
relevant CNL in a calendar year, the President shall withdraw duty-free 
treatment for such article by July 1 of the following year and modify 
the HTS accordingly.
10. On January 6, 1987, Colombia was granted a waiver of the CNL for 
imports under HTS subheading 1701.11.05. Despite the existing waiver of 
the CNL, on July 5, 2001, duty-free treatment was withdrawn in error for 
imports from Colombia under HTS subheading 1701.11.05 because import 
levels exceeded the relevant CNL in calendar year 2000. A technical 
correction to the HTS is required to reflect the waiver of the CNL for 
imports from Colombia under HTS subheading 1701.11.05.

date of this proclamation.
(7) For purposes of the GSP program, in order to provide the intended

Proclamation 8241 of April 17, 2008

Small Business Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In communities across America, small business owners are working hard to 
turn their dreams into enterprises. Small Business Week is a time to 
celebrate the many achievements of small business owners, entrepreneurs, 
and employees, who contribute to the vitality and prosperity of our 
Nation and create new job opportunities for our citizens.
Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, and my 
Administration is committed to fostering an environment in which the 
entrepreneurial spirit can thrive. By keeping taxes low, we leave more 
money in the hands of Americans to save, spend, and invest. This year, 
we have also temporarily expanded incentives to help small businesses 
invest in new equipment and expand their enterprises. We have also 
expanded market access and opened new markets for American goods and 
services abroad, helping our small businesses compete in the global 
economy. To make health care more affordable and accessible, we continue 
to support Association Health Plans so small businesses can band 
together to get the same discounts that big companies receive.
The underpinnings of our economy are strong, competitive, and resilient 
enough to overcome the challenges we face, and in the long run, 
Americans can be confident that our economy will continue to grow. 
During Small Business Week and throughout the year, we recognize the 
determination and ingenuity of America's workers and entrepreneurs who 
play a vital role in building a more prosperous future for our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 20 through April 26, 
2008, as Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs that 
celebrate the achievements of small business owners and their employees 
and encourage the development of new small businesses.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8242 of April 21, 2008

National Day of Prayer, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America trusts in the abiding power of prayer and asks for the wisdom to 
discern God's will in times of joy and of trial. As we observe this 
National Day of Prayer, we recognize our dependence on the Almighty, we 
thank Him for the many blessings He has bestowed upon us, and we put our 
country's future in His hands.
From our Nation's humble beginnings, prayer has guided our leaders and 
played a vital role in the life and history of the United States. 
Americans of many different faiths share the profound conviction that 
God listens to the voice of His children and pours His grace upon those 
who seek Him in prayer. By surrendering our lives to our loving Father, 
we learn to serve His eternal purposes, and we are strengthened, 
refreshed, and ready for all that may come.
On this National Day of Prayer, we ask God's continued blessings on our 
country. This year's theme, ``Prayer! America's Strength and Shield,'' 
is taken from Psalm 28:7, ``The Lord is my strength and my shield; my 
heart trusts in him, and I am helped.'' On this day, we pray for the 
safety of our brave men and women in uniform, for their families, and 
for the comfort and recovery of those who have been wounded.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on our 
Nation to reaffirm the role of prayer in our society by recognizing each 
year a ``National Day of Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2008, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
ask the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, each according to his or 
her own faith, for the freedoms and blessings we have received and for 
God's continued guidance, comfort, and protection. I invite all 
Americans to join in observing this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8243 of April 22, 2008

Older Americans Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Older Americans Month, we recognize the many ways older citizens 
have enriched our Nation through their character, wisdom, and love.

[[Page 34]]

Our country remains strong because of the foundation our elders have 
helped lay. This year's Older Americans Month theme, ``Working Together 
for Strong, Healthy, and Supportive Communities,'' highlights the 
importance of building partnerships to ensure that older Americans are 
able to live with dignity and independence.
Every week thousands of older Americans give back to their communities 
by volunteering through groups like Senior Corps. From teaching young 
children how to read, to helping provide relief to those affected by 
natural disasters, seniors play an important and compassionate role in 
our Nation.
My Administration is dedicated to ensuring that our seniors are treated 
with the respect they have earned. They deserve to have choices and 
access to the best possible health care, so we have added new preventive 
care measures and prescription drug benefits as part of our effort to 
modernize Medicare and make medication more affordable. In this way and 
many others, our country honors our elders' legacy and recognizes their 
countless contributions to our Nation.
America's seniors provide an example for younger generations, and during 
Older Americans Month, we reflect on their efforts toward building a 
stronger and brighter future for all. Our country remains forever in 
their debt, as they have provided a guiding light for the rest of the 
Nation to follow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2008 as Older 
Americans Month. I commend older Americans for the many contributions 
they have made and continue to make to our Nation. I also commend the 
Federal, State, local, and tribal organizations, service and health care 
providers, caregivers, and volunteers who dedicate their time and 
talents to our seniors. I encourage all citizens to honor their elders, 
care for those in need, and reaffirm our country's commitment to older 
Americans this month and throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8244 of April 22, 2008

National Volunteer Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Through countless acts of kindness, volunteers across America are 
changing our Nation for the better. During National Volunteer Week, we 
recognize those who take the time to help their fellow citizens realize 
the full potential of America.

[[Page 35]]

Through volunteer work, Americans can demonstrate the kindness and 
generosity that make our Nation great. Mentoring a child, teaching 
someone to read, visiting the elderly, feeding the hungry, and finding 
shelter for the homeless are all examples of how Americans can and do 
aid those in need. Americans are volunteering in record numbers. Each 
year, millions of Americans volunteer, and more of our fellow citizens 
are discovering that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of 
service. The cumulative effort of the love and compassion from our 
Nation's volunteers will help secure a more hopeful future for all our 
citizens.
My Administration remains committed to building a culture of service, 
citizenship, and responsibility. The USA Freedom Corps strengthens civic 
engagement and volunteer service in America and helps people connect 
with volunteer opportunities. By visiting the USA Freedom Corps website 
at volunteer.gov, individuals can find information about ways they can 
help in their local areas and across the country.
The strength of America comes from its compassionate and loving 
citizens. National Volunteer Week is an opportunity to show appreciation 
for our Nation's volunteers. The time and energy they dedicate to 
helping those in need reflect the true spirit of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 27 through May 3, 
2008, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize 
and celebrate the important work that volunteers do every day throughout 
our country. I also encourage citizens to explore ways to help their 
neighbors in need and serve a cause greater than self.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Loyalty Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans believe that every man, woman, and child has unalienable 
rights, dignity, and matchless value. Advancing these ideals was the 
honorable vision of our Founders and the mission that helped shape this 
great country. On Loyalty Day, we celebrate the legacy of freedom and 
the shared ideals that bind us together.
Our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen demonstrate 
their love of country by stepping forward when America needs them most. 
By putting our country's security before their own, the men and women of

[[Page 36]]

military and their families for their service, sacrifice, and 
dedication, and we are proud of their accomplishments.
Through their good works, our Nation's volunteers bear witness to their 
steadfast love for America, as exemplified in their commitment to 
service and good citizenship. Loyalty to this country brings with it a 
commitment to aid our family, friends, and fellow citizens all across 
this broad and welcoming land. These volunteers demonstrate their 
gratitude for the blessings of freedom by helping build a more hopeful 
future for our children and grandchildren. All Americans can put their 
loyalty into practice by learning more about the history of our country, 
flying the American flag, and contributing to our communities.
Two hundred and thirty-two years after the founding of our country, we 
remain committed to advancing freedom and renewing the values that 
sustain our liberty. Through the spirit and determination of our people, 
our Nation will prosper and our liberty will be secure.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated May 1 of 
each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' This Loyalty Day, and throughout the year, 
I ask all Americans to join me in reaffirming our allegiance to our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2008, as Loyalty Day. I call upon all 
people of the United States to join in support of this national 
observance and to display the flag of the United States on Loyalty Day 
as a symbol of pride in our Nation.

Malaria Awareness Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Malaria Awareness Day, our Nation recognizes all who suffer from this 
devastating disease, and we remember the lives lost to an illness that 
is entirely preventable and treatable. Today, we renew our commitment to 
lead the world toward the urgent goal and noble mission of turning the 
tide against malaria in Africa and around the world.
My Administration and our partners are working together to save lives in 
Africa through the President's Malaria Initiative. On a recent trip to 
Africa, First Lady Laura Bush and I personally saw this Initiative 
working and making incredible progress against malaria. By distributing 
insecticide-treated bed nets, expanding indoor insecticide spraying, 
providing cutting-edge drugs to those in need, and empowering African 
leaders to determine the best strategy for their country, we have 
brought an extraordinary

[[Page 37]]

achievement within reach: together, we can eradicate a disease that has 
claimed the lives of children for centuries. Millions of lives are being 
saved because of the kindness and generosity of the American people, and 
we will continue to work to ensure that our aggressive and comprehensive 
strategy achieves its goal.
America is a compassionate country that feeds the hungry and protects 
the vulnerable because we believe every human life has inherent dignity 
and matchless value. As the people of Africa continue their struggle 
against malaria, we offer our support and steadfast commitment. We call 
on all nations to join us in a great humanitarian effort.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 25, 2008, as Malaria 
Awareness Day. I encourage Americans to answer the universal call to

Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans who trace their ancestry to Asia and the Pacific Islands have 
contributed much to our Nation. During Asian/Pacific American Heritage 
Month, we highlight their importance to our great Nation.
Asian/Pacific Americans have made our country better with their talents 
and hard work. Their values and commitment to family and community have 
helped shape and strengthen America. These citizens speak many 
languages, honor countless traditions, and practice different faiths, 
but they are bound by a shared commitment to freedom and liberty. The 
diversity among Asian/Pacific Americans adds to the cultural fabric of 
our society.
Asian/Pacific Americans have enriched our culture, excelling in many 
fields, including education, business, science, technology, government, 
sports, and the arts. We especially honor those Asian/Pacific Americans 
who have answered the call to protect the cause of freedom by serving in 
our Armed Forces. These brave men and women set a powerful example for 
all Americans.
As we celebrate Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, we are reminded 
of the richness of the Asian and Pacific cultures. Asian/Pacific 
Americans enhance the American experience and contribute to our 
country's legacy of diversity.

[[Page 38]]

To honor the achievements and contributions of Asian/Pacific Americans, 
the Congress, by Public Law 102-450, as amended, has designated the

Jewish American Heritage Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Jewish American Heritage Month is an opportunity to celebrate the 
history, culture, and faith of Jewish Americans and their contributions 
to our Nation.
The story of the Jewish people in America is the story of America 
itself. When the first Jewish settlers arrived on our shores hundreds of 
years ago, they saw a land of promise and liberty. With hard work and 
determination, these individuals helped build our country and strengthen 
our values. Their commitment to religious freedom and their belief in 
democracy have enriched our society and helped make our country a beacon 
of hope for all.
Many Jewish Americans have served in our military with valor and 
distinction in times of war and peace. We pay special tribute to all 
those who stepped forward when our country needed them most. These 
American heroes confronted grave dangers to protect our Nation.
During Jewish American Heritage Month and throughout the year, we honor 
Jewish Americans who played an integral role in shaping the cultural 
fabric of our Nation. Their spirit and talents have helped America 
succeed and prosper, and their efforts continue to remind us of the many 
blessings of this great country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Health and fitness are personal responsibilities and important national 
goals for our citizens. During National Physical Fitness and Sports 
Month, we highlight the benefits of exercise and the value of 
participating in sports.
It is important for all Americans to participate in activities that help 
maintain a healthy lifestyle. Outdoor activities such as walking, 
running, swimming, and biking are good for the mind, body, and soul. 
Regular physical activity and healthy eating habits can help reduce 
stress and lower the risk for many chronic health conditions such as 
heart disease, diabetes, and depression.
My Administration is committed to encouraging all Americans to remain 
physically active. Through the President's Council on Physical Fitness 
and Sports, the National President's Challenge allows participants of 
all ages to set a fitness goal and keep track of their progress as they 
work to achieve it. To get more information, or to sign up to 
participate, people can visit presidentschallenge.org. By getting 
involved and exercising for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, Americans 
can improve their health and happiness and set a positive example for 
others.
During National Physical Fitness and Sports month and throughout the 
year, I encourage all Americans to make physical fitness a priority in 
their lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2008 as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon my fellow citizens to

Proclamation 8250 of April 30, 2008

Law Day, U.S.A., 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The right of ordinary men and women to determine their own future, 
protected by the rule of law, lies at the heart of America's founding 
principles. As our country celebrates the 50th anniversary of Law Day, 
we renew our commitment to the ideals on which this great Nation was 
established and to a robust system of ordered liberty.
The American legal system is central to protecting the rights and 
freedoms our Nation holds dear. The theme of this year's Law Day, ``The 
Rule of Law: Foundation for Communities of Opportunity and Equity,'' 
recognizes the fundamental role that the rule of law plays in preserving 
liberty in our Nation and in all free societies. We pay tribute to the 
men and women in America's legal community. Through hard work and 
dedication to the rule of law, members of the judiciary and the legal 
profession help secure the rights of individuals, bring justice to our 
communities, and reinforce the proud traditions that make America a 
beacon of light for the world.
Nearly 800 years ago, the Magna Carta placed the authority of government 
under the rule of law; centuries later, the Declaration of Independence 
and the United States Constitution marked tremendous advances in the 
march of liberty. These documents established enduring principles that 
guide modern democracies. Today, we are reminded of that past and look 
toward a hopeful future as we work to secure the liberty that is the 
natural right of every man, woman, and child.
On Law Day, U.S.A., our Nation celebrates our belief in the equality of 
each person before God and renews our commitment to strive to bring 
America ever closer to its founding ideals.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2008, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all the people of 
the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. I also call upon Government officials to display the flag of 
the United States in support of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

National Charter Schools Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Education is the cornerstone of a hopeful tomorrow. During National 
Charter Schools Week, we highlight the contributions of charter schools 
to ensuring that our Nation's future leaders have the skills and 
knowledge necessary for a lifetime of achievement.
Charter schools are educational alternatives that empower families with 
additional choices for their children. By providing flexibility to 
educators while insisting on results, charter schools are helping foster 
a culture of educational innovation, accountability, and excellence. 
Charter schools also encourage parental involvement and help contribute 
to the national effort to close the achievement gap.
The No Child Left Behind Act has played a central role in America's 
efforts to improve our public schools and expand the opportunities 
available to our children. In 2007, American students reached record 
achievement levels on reading and math tests, and the achievement gap is 
beginning to close. Charter schools have been an important part of this 
success. National Charter Schools Week is an opportunity to recognize 
the strength, vitality, and excellence of outstanding schools.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 4 through May 10, 
2008, as National Charter Schools Week. I applaud our Nation's charter 
schools and all those who make them a success, and I call on parents of 
charter school students to share their success stories and help 
Americans understand more about the important work of charter schools.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8252 of May 5, 2008

Military Spouse Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Military spouses embody the courage, nobility of duty, and love of 
country that inspire every American. On Military Spouse Day, we pay 
tribute to the husbands and wives who support their spouses in America's 
Armed Forces during times of war and peace.

[[Page 42]]

The legacy of military spouses began when colonial Americans were 
fighting for independence. Martha Washington boosted the morale of her 
husband's troops by visiting battlefields and tending to the wounded. 
Since then, members of our Armed Forces have served our Nation 
accompanied by the steadfast love and support of their spouses and 
families.
While our men and women in uniform are protecting our country's founding 
ideals of liberty, democracy, and justice, their spouses live with 
uncommon challenges, endure sleepless nights, and spend long periods 
raising children alone. Many military spouses are also committed 
volunteers, serving other military families and local communities. Our 
Nation benefits from the sacrifices of our military families, and we are 
inspired by their courage, strength, and leadership.
On Military Spouse Day and throughout the year, we honor the commitment 
spouses have made to freedom's cause. To learn about ways to support our 
troops and their spouses and families, I encourage all Americans to 
visit www.americasupportsyou.mil.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 9, 2008, as Military 
Spouse Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities and by expressing their 
gratitude to the husbands and wives of those serving in the United 
States Armed Forces.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

On Mother's Day, we honor the grace, wisdom, and strength of our 
mothers, and we celebrate the special bonds shared between mothers and

Mothers work tirelessly to help their children build healthy and 
successful lives. Through their positive examples and countless acts of 
kindness, mothers teach the values of generosity and compassion and the 
importance of family and community. As President Ronald Reagan said, 
``From our mothers, we first learn about values and caring and the 
difference between right and wrong.'' By providing a nurturing 
environment where their children can grow in confidence and character, 
mothers lay the foundation for the next generation of Americans to 
realize their full potential.
Our Nation is grateful for the sacrifices mothers make every day and for 
the unconditional love they give their children. We are especially 
thankful

[[Page 43]]

for the mothers who support their sons and daughters serving in our 
Armed Forces and for the mothers who bring honor to the uniform of the 
United States by defending our freedom at home and abroad.
Every child blessed with a mother's love has been given one of life's 
great gifts. On this Mother's Day, we recognize the extraordinary 
contributions America's mothers make to their children, their families, 
and our country.
To honor mothers, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 
1914, as amended (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May 
each year as ``Mother's Day'' and has requested the President to call 
for its appropriate observance. May God bless mothers across America on 
this special day and throughout the year.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 11, 2008, as Mother's Day. I encourage 
all Americans to show their gratitude and love to mothers for making a 
difference in the lives of their children, families, and communities. I 
call upon citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8254 of May 9, 2008

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's transportation system strengthens our national security and 
keeps our country moving. On National Defense Transportation Day and 
during National Transportation Week, we thank the men and women of the 
transportation industry for their efforts to ensure that our Nation's 
infrastructure operates effectively and efficiently.
Innovation, investment, and imagination have enabled new modes of 
transportation to revolutionize the world. Today, businesses can deliver 
goods and services faster than ever, first responders can quickly bring 
hope and healing to those in need, and people can visit loved ones 
across the country or around the globe. The Armed Forces utilize modern 
transportation to deploy troops, move supplies, and bring our heroes 
home from the front lines. We are grateful for the hard work of all 
transportation professionals.
My Administration supports the continued creation of safer, more secure, 
and more reliable roadways, bridges, airports, seaports, and mass 
transit systems. We are addressing the challenges facing our 
transportation system today, helping lay the groundwork for future 
demands, and giving State and local authorities the flexibility to solve 
transportation problems in their

[[Page 44]]

communities. By promoting research in advanced transportation 
technologies, my Administration is also working to help end our reliance 
on foreign sources of energy, improve our environment, and strengthen 
our economic and national security.
To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry 
and who contribute to our Nation's well-being and defense, the Congress, 
by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), 
has requested that the President designate the third Friday in May of 
each year as ``National Defense Transportation Day,'' and, by joint 
resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), that the 
week during which that Friday falls be designated as ``National 
Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 16, 2008, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 11 through May 17, 2008, as National 
Transportation Week. I encourage all Americans to learn how our modern 
transportation system contributes to the security of our citizens and 
the prosperity of our country and to celebrate these observances with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of

Peace Officers' Memorial Day and Police Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our Nation, law enforcement officers carry the great 
responsibility of protecting their fellow citizens. On Peace Officers' 
Memorial Day and during Police Week, we honor these brave public 
servants who fight crime, violence, and terrorism, and we pay homage to 
the heroes who have fallen in the line of duty.
With valor and devotion, our country's law enforcement officers stand 
watch on the front lines and help make our communities safer and more 
secure. Fulfilling their duties with courage and commitment, they work 
tirelessly and put themselves in harm's way, exemplifying the good and 
decent character of America.
As we observe Peace Officers' Memorial Day and Police Week, we pause to 
pay tribute to those who serve in law enforcement. On this occasion, we 
especially remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, and we 
pray for the families and friends they have left behind. We thank all 
the extraordinary American men and women who have answered the call to 
serve in law enforcement for their commitment to justice and to their 
communities.

[[Page 45]]

By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 
676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the 
President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each 
year as ``Peace Officers' Memorial Day'' and the week in which it falls

America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2008, as Peace Officers' Memorial 
Day and May 11 through May 17, 2008, as Police Week. I call on all 
Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. I also call on Governors of the United States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject 
to the jurisdiction of the United States, as well as appropriate 
officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown 
at half staff on Peace Officers' Memorial Day. I further encourage all 
Americans to display the flag at half staff from their homes and 
businesses on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of May,

Proclamation 8256 of May 15, 2008

National Safe Boating Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's beautiful waterways provide opportunities for recreational 
activities for millions of Americans. During National Safe Boating Week, 
we raise awareness of the importance of practicing and promoting safe 
boating.
Recreational boating is one of America's most popular pastimes, and it 
is important for every boater to take proper safety precautions. The 
United States Coast Guard encourages citizens to take preventive 
measures such as wearing a life jacket, never boating under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol, and taking a boating safety course. Too 
often, accidents occur on boats where the operator had not received 
boating safety instruction. Receiving a vessel safety check once a year 
will also help ensure a safe boating experience. To learn important 
information about boating, visit uscgboating.org. During National Safe 
Boating Week and throughout the year, I urge all Americans to put safety 
first when enjoying our country's magnificent waters.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe 
Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 17 through May 23, 2008, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage the Governors of the 50 States and the

[[Page 46]]

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, to join in observing this week. I 
also urge all Americans to learn more about safe boating practices and 
always act responsibly while on the water.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8257 of May 15, 2008

World Trade Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Free and fair trade helps secure a future of freedom and promise. During 
World Trade Week, we recognize the positive effects of opening markets 
around the world. Open markets play an integral role in America's 
economic progress, creating better-paying jobs, expanding consumer 
choices, and providing increased opportunities for American workers and 
employers. Free and fair trade also increases economic growth among our 
trading partners.
My Administration is committed to expanding economic freedom worldwide. 
We will continue to seek an ambitious outcome in the Doha Round that 
will reduce and eliminate tariffs and other barriers on goods and open 
new markets for services trade. The Doha Round provides a once-in-a-
generation opportunity to advance open markets, strengthen economic 
growth, and help millions rise out of poverty.
We also encourage the Congress to approve our pending trade agreements 
with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Our free trade agreement with 
Colombia is important, because it will support one of our closest allies 
in the Western Hemisphere currently under assault from a terrorist 
network. Congressional approval of this agreement would make clear 
America's unshakeable commitment to advancing the benefits of free 
markets and the interests of free people.
Today, nearly 250,000 U.S. firms export U.S. products. Ninety-seven 
percent of those exporters are small- or medium-sized businesses. The 
number of U.S. small business exporters has more than doubled since 
1992. Those businesses have surpassed a quarter of a trillion dollars in 
annual export sales.
Free and fair trade helps reinforce our Nation's commitments to 
democracy, transparency, and the rule of law. This week and throughout 
the year, we recognize the importance of trade in promoting prosperity 
and freedom in the United States and around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 18 through May 24,

[[Page 47]]

2008, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate 
the benefits of trade to our Nation and the global economy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8258 of May 20, 2008

A Day of Solidarity With the Cuban People, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of worship are among 
the liberties that Americans cherish. Our Nation fully supports the 
brave people who work to secure these liberties in the countries where 
they are denied. And on this Day of Solidarity with the Cuban People, we 
focus our attention on the men and women working to secure freedom, 
democracy, and human rights for the citizens of Cuba.
For half a century, the Cuban people have suffered under oppressive 
dictatorship. Under the rule of Fidel and Raul Castro, Cubans have seen 
their political freedoms denied, their economy reduced to shambles, and 
their families torn apart. The Cuban people deserve better--and the 
American people stand with them as they work to achieve it.
The United States is rallying the free world to the cause of Cuban 
liberty. We continue to shine a bright light on the Castro regime's 
abuses--and America calls on the Government of Cuba to immediately and 
unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience.
We keep these prisoners, their families, and all Cubans in our prayers. 
Especially on this Day of Solidarity, we ask the Almighty to comfort and 
strengthen those who suffer under the Castro dictatorship--and to hasten 
the day when Cuba's suffering comes to an end.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 21, 2008, as A Day of 
Solidarity with the Cuban People to recognize those who are suffering in 
Cuba, especially Cuba's prisoners of conscience. I call upon the 
citizens of the United States to mark this observance with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities that demonstrate America's resolute support 
for those living under the Castro regime.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8259 of May 21, 2008

National Maritime Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On National Maritime Day, America honors our highly skilled mariners who 
sail the high seas, support those on the front lines of the war on 
terror, and promote commerce around the world.
Since 1775, the United States Merchant Marine has served our country, 
helping America become a great maritime power. During the Second World 
War, courageous mariners were among those who suffered greatly--hundreds 
of ships were lost to enemy action, and many mariners made the ultimate 
sacrifice. We pay tribute to these heroes who answered the call to serve 
when our Nation needed them most. Today, our merchant mariners continue 
to protect our homeland, including by supporting our troops in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.
In times of peace and war, these brave patriots help keep our Nation 
safe and strengthen our economy. By transporting American goods across 
the oceans, merchant mariners facilitate commerce and advance trade. 
These Americans honor the noble traditions of seafarers and enrich our 
country's maritime heritage.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 20, 1933, as amended, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day,'' and has 
authorized and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2008, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance by 
honoring the service of merchant mariners and by displaying the flag of 
the United States at their homes and in their communities. I also 
request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on 
that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.

Proclamation 8260 of May 22, 2008

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Memorial Day, we honor the heroes who have laid down their lives in 
the cause of freedom, resolve that they will forever be remembered by a

[[Page 49]]

grateful Nation, and pray that our country may always prove worthy of 
the sacrifices they have made.
Throughout our Nation's history, our course has been secured by brave 
Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen. These 
courageous and selfless warriors have stepped forward to protect the 
Nation they love, fight for America's highest ideals, and show millions 
that a future of liberty is possible. Freedoms come at great costs, yet 
the world has been transformed in unimaginable ways because of the noble 
service and devotion to duty of these brave individuals. Our country 
honors the sacrifice made by those who have given their lives to spread 
the blessings of liberty and lay the foundations of peace, and we mourn 
their loss.
Today, our service men and women continue to inspire and strengthen our 
Nation, going above and beyond the call of duty as part of the greatest 
military the world has ever known. Americans are grateful to all those 
who have put on our Nation's uniform and to their families, and we will 
always remember their service and sacrifice for our freedoms.
On this solemn day our country unites to pay tribute to the fallen, who 
demonstrated the strength of their convictions and paid the cost of 
freedom. We pray for the members of our Armed Forces and their families, 
and we ask for God's continued guidance of our country.
In respect for their devotion to America, the Congress, by a joint 
resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (64 Stat. 158), has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of 
the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for 
permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 
106-579, has also designated the minute beginning at 3:00 p.m. local 
time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe the National 
Moment of Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 26, 2008, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3:00 p.m., local time, on Memorial Day. I encourage the 
media to participate in these observances. I also request the Governors 
of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the 
appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the 
flag be flown at half staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all 
buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States, and 
in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the 
people of the United States to display the flag at half staff from their 
homes for the customary forenoon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Hurricane Preparedness Week highlights the vital importance of 
being prepared when natural disasters strike.
Tropical storms can cause destruction over entire regions and claim the 
lives of many of our citizens. We can help reduce vulnerability in our 
communities by encouraging all citizens to be prepared and to work 
together. Maintaining emergency supply kits and family communication 
plans, and knowing what to do in an emergency can help save lives. For 
more information on hurricane preparedness, Americans can visit 
ready.gov and fema.gov to find checklists and other valuable resources 
to help them get prepared.
My Administration continues to support efforts to strengthen how 
Americans prepare for and respond to disasters. The National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration works to predict and track storms so that 
citizens are more aware of potential storms. The Department of Homeland 
Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has improved 
communication between Federal, State, local government, and the private 
sector in order to help citizens stay informed and receive the help they 
need. By working together, we can better prepare for, respond to, and 
recover from hurricanes and reduce the harm to our citizens and our 
communities.
As hurricane season approaches, we also express our gratitude to the 
volunteers and first responders who help their fellow citizens in their 
time of need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 25 through May 31, 
2008, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government 
agencies, private organizations, schools, and the media to share 
information about hurricane preparedness. I also urge all Americans 
living in vulnerable coastal areas to take appropriate measures and 
precautions to protect themselves, their homes, and their communities 
against the effects of hurricanes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence

Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Caribbean-American Heritage Month is an opportunity to show our 
appreciation for the many ways Caribbean Americans have contributed to 
our country.
Caribbean Americans have helped to shape our national fabric with their 
vibrant traditions and their unique history. They have brightened our 
lives with the spirit and vitality of their culture. Through strong 
leadership and pride in their heritage, they have enriched America. In 
all walks of life, they have contributed their many talents and added to 
our Nation's development and prosperity.
We especially show our gratitude for the men and women of Caribbean 
descent who have served bravely in our Armed Forces and those still 
serving today. These heroes have answered a call greater than self, and 
we keep them in our thoughts and prayers.
During June, we celebrate and recognize the Caribbean Americans whose 
determination and hard work have helped make our country a better place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

National Homeownership Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For many Americans, owning a home represents freedom, independence, and 
the American dream. During National Homeownership Month, we highlight 
the benefits of owning a home and encourage our fellow citizens to be 
responsible homeowners.

[[Page 52]]

My Administration is committed to helping Americans achieve their dreams 
of homeownership. We have worked to ensure that the mortgage industry is 
more transparent, reliable, and fair, and in order to sustain 
homeownership, we have launched initiatives to help responsible 
homeowners keep their homes. The FHASecure program has given the Federal 
Housing Administration more flexibility in refinancing mortgages for 
homeowners who have good credit histories but cannot afford their 
current payments. In addition, the HOPE NOW Alliance connects struggling 
homeowners with lenders, loan servicers, and mortgage counselors to help 
families stay in their homes. Homeowners deserve our help, and these 
initiatives assist those in need.
During National Homeownership Month and throughout the year, I encourage 
all Americans to take advantage of financial education opportunities to 
explore homeownership. My Advisory Council on Financial Literacy is 
finding ways to help educate people from all walks of life about matters 
pertaining to their finances and their futures. By practicing fiscal 
responsibility, Americans can contribute to the strength of our 
neighborhoods and our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2008 as National 
Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the United States to join 
me in recognizing the importance of homeownership and building a more 
prosperous future for themselves and their communities.

Black Music Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's diverse musical heritage exemplifies the creativity and 
optimism of our Nation. During Black Music Month, we celebrate the 
extraordinary talents and creativity of African-American singers, 
musicians, and composers whose achievements have enriched our culture 
and enhanced our lives.
For generations, African-American artists have created music that 
communicates across racial boundaries and expresses both joy and sorrow. 
When facing the cruelty of slavery and injustice, African Americans 
lifted spirituals to the heavens, bringing comfort to troubled souls. 
These timeless declarations of hope and faith evolved into the more 
modern genres of gospel, blues, ragtime, and jazz, and they are given 
voice in the musical genius

[[Page 53]]

of Scott Joplin, Marian Anderson, Eubie Blake, and Mahalia Jackson. 
During the Civil Rights era, African-American musicians such as Duke 
Ellington, Muddy Waters, and Ruth Brown conveyed the struggles of their 
communities while bringing people of all backgrounds together. Today, 
this music continues to inspire America's citizens and advance its 
creative spirit.
Throughout the course of American history, black musicians have used 
their great talents to share the richness of the African-American 
experience and to develop a uniquely American style of music enjoyed 
throughout the world. This month, we honor the pioneers of African-
American music and today's contemporary artists who have enriched the 
lives of people everywhere.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2008 as Black Music 
Month. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the history of 
black music and to enjoy the great contributions of African-American 
singers, musicians, and composers.

wonders. This past year, we have made great strides in helping wildlife 
thrive and in restoring habitat for migratory birds through cooperative 
conservation. Working with State and tribal officials, we are preserving 
important wildlife habitats and expanding the National Wildlife Refuge 
system. Citizens can visit takepride.gov to learn more about 
opportunities to care for our environment.
Great Outdoors Month is an opportunity to honor those who work to keep 
our natural places beautiful and to celebrate some of our country's 
favorite outdoor pastimes. These activities encourage a healthy 
lifestyle and give Americans pride in the great American landscape. As 
responsible stewards

proud that our nations are allies in the cause of peace and security 
around the world.
In celebrating Italian Independence Day, we commemorate the freedoms our

Proclamation 8267 of May 30, 2008

National Child's Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America has a duty to provide its children with the support and skills 
they need to become the next generation of responsible leaders. On 
National Child's Day, we underscore the importance of fostering the 
love, encouragement, and protection that empowers our children to become 
happy and successful adults.
Children are a precious gift who need the love and support of family and 
friends to lead lives rich in promise and fulfillment. Parents are the 
most vital part of a child's life, providing them with the guidance and 
discipline to make the right choices and understand the consequences of 
their actions. Family, teachers, and others inspire our youth to use 
their talents and to become confident and caring adults. Religious and 
community leaders also have a role in teaching values and encouraging 
children to love their neighbors just as they would like to be loved 
themselves. Together, we can all help our children be prepared to meet 
life's challenges and realize the great promise of our country.
My Administration continues to support programs that help prepare 
America's youth for the opportunities ahead. The No Child Left Behind 
Act requires that every child have access to a quality education. We 
have made significant progress toward that goal across the country, with 
students achieving record math and reading scores. The America COMPETES 
Act, which was built upon my American Competitiveness Initiative, helped 
strengthen our goal of staying competitive within the global economy. 
The Helping America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, 
encourages adults to work to help our young people reach their full 
potential.
On National Child's Day and throughout the year, we honor the boys and 
girls of America and show our gratitude to those who work to support 
them. This day is a reminder to us all that our commitment to children 
helps make our country a better place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 1, 2008, as National 
Child's Day. I call upon all our citizens to celebrate National Child's 
Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also urge all 
Americans to dedicate time and energy to educating our youth and 
providing them with a safe and caring environment.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8268 of June 2, 2008

National Oceans Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Oceans have provided an important part of our heritage, economy, and 
recreation, and they are a vital resource for our country and the world. 
During National Oceans Month, we reaffirm our commitment to protect and 
wisely use these precious waters and the habitat beneath them.
We have a solemn responsibility to care for our seas and show concern 
for the plant and animal life that inhabit them. Oceans bring enjoyment 
and prosperity to countless people, from boating and fishing, to 
transporting goods, to traveling the waterways. By being good stewards 
of the oceans, we can ensure that future generations are able to enjoy 
the great blessings of our natural heritage.
My Administration is committed to safeguarding the oceans and ensuring 
effective conservation. Since the release of my Ocean Action Plan in 
2004, we have taken steps to prevent pollution and improve the health of 
marine wildlife by working with State, tribal, and local governments, as 
well as private sector and international partners. We are working to end 
overfishing in U.S. waters and to stop destructive fishing practices on 
the high seas. We are also supporting ocean programs to educate the 
public on the need to prevent marine debris and improve the quality of 
the marine environment, as well as other projects such as the 
International Coral Reef Initiative that can help conserve and restore 
delicate and essential ecosystems. By working to protect our oceans, we 
ensure that natural wonders like the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National 
Monument in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands will be enjoyed for 
generations to come.
This month is an opportunity to show our gratitude toward all those who 
work to protect the oceans, to learn more about the vital role oceans 
play in the life of our country, and to discover ways we can conserve 
their many natural treasures.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2008 as National 
Oceans Month. I encourage all our citizens to observe this month with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8269 of June 6, 2008

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The American flag has been our national symbol for 231 years, and it 
remains a beacon of freedom wherever it is flown. Since the Second 
Continental Congress adopted the Stars and Stripes as our flag in 1777, 
it has stood for freedom, justice, and the resolve of our Nation.
When Francis Scott Key saw the American flag flying over Fort McHenry in 
1814, he believed that liberty would triumph. The flag that inspired Key 
to write our National Anthem still energizes and emboldens the American 
spirit today. As our Nation faces the challenges of a new era, Old Glory 
reminds us that liberty can prevail over oppression.
Since the first days of our Republic, Americans have flown the flag to 
show their pride and appreciation for the freedoms they enjoy in this 
great Nation. Every day, Americans pledge their allegiance to the flag 
of the United States, and our troops carry it before them as they defend 
the liberties for which it stands.
On Flag Day and during National Flag Week, we remember those in uniform 
whose courage and sacrifice inspire us here at home. We also remember 
the rich history of one of our oldest national symbols and reflect on 
our duty to carry our heritage of freedom into the future.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and 
for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution 
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President 
issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all citizens of the 
United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2008, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 8, 2008, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
appropriate places. I also call upon the people of the United States to 
observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through 
Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a 
time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings 
and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the 
Flag of the United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8270 of June 12, 2008

Father's Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Father's Day, we honor our Nation's fathers for the unconditional 
love they give to their children and for their selfless dedication to 
the well-being of their families.
Fathers play a unique and irreplaceable part in the lives of their 
children and pass along values that help children grow into responsible 
adults. By providing their sons and daughters with a positive example, 
fathers help give their children the necessary foundation they need to 
make wise decisions throughout their lives. Fathers strive to inspire 
their children to lead lives of integrity, honor, and purpose, and they 
pray for wisdom and the strength to give their children the love and 
support they need to achieve their dreams.
All Americans are thankful for the extraordinary efforts of our Nation's 
fathers, stepfathers, grandfathers, and guardians. Their devotion and 
encouragement as mentors, providers, and role models help strengthen 
their families and our country. We are especially grateful for the 
fathers who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. These dedicated fathers 
protect liberty so that all children can have a more promising future. 
We pray for the safe return of all those serving overseas, and we thank 
the fathers who support sons and daughters who are defending our freedom 
around the globe.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 15, 
2008, as Father's Day. I encourage all Americans to express their 
appreciation to all fathers for their many contributions to our Nation's 
children. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to 
display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on 
this day. I also call upon State and local governments and citizens to 
observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
second.

Proclamation 8272 of June 30, 2008

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences, Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and 
Opportunity Act, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 1. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary 
developing countries, except those designated as least-developed 
beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
countries as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to competitive need limitations on the 
preferential treatment afforded under the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) to eligible articles.
 2. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2461 and 2463(a)(1)(A)), the President may designate articles as 
eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP.
 3. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) 
provides that the President may disregard the competitive need 
limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A) (i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from 
any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of 
the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
 4. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(d)(1)), the President may waive the application of the competitive 
need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act with respect to 
any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain 
conditions are met.
 5. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(d)(5)), any waiver granted under section 503(d) shall remain in 
effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer 
warranted due to changed circumstances.
 6. Section 502(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(e)) provides that the 
President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP if the President determines 
that such country has become a ``high income'' country as defined by the 
official statistics of the International Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. Termination is effective on January 1 of the second year 
following the year in which such determination is made.
 7. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that in 2007 certain beneficiary developing countries have exported 
certain eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable 
competitive need limitations, and I therefore terminate the duty-free 
treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.

[[Page 61]]

 8. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect 
to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing 
countries.
 9. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the 
advice of the United States International Trade Commission on whether 
any industries in the United States are likely to be adversely affected 
by such waivers, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the 
considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2462(c)), and after giving great weight to the considerations in 
section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such 
waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. 
Accordingly, I have determined that the competitive need limitations of 
section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act should be waived with respect to 
certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.
 10. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that certain previously granted waivers of the competitive need 
limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act are no longer 
warranted due to changed circumstances.
 11. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that 
Trinidad and Tobago has become a ``high income'' country, and I am 
terminating the designation of that country as a beneficiary developing 
country for purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2010.
 12. Section 502(a)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(1)) authorizes 
the President to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries 
for purposes of the GSP. In Proclamation 7912 of June 29, 2005, I 
designated Serbia and Montenegro as a beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP. On June 3, 2006, upon Montenegro's declaration of 
independence from Serbia and Montenegro, the country separated into two 
independent republics: the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of 
Montenegro. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and taking into 
account the factors set forth in section 502(c) of that Act, I have 
determined that, in light of the separation of Serbia and Montenegro 
into two countries, the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of 
Montenegro should each be designated as a beneficiary developing country 
for purposes of the GSP.
 13. Section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as 
added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title 
I of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 254) (AGOA), authorizes the President 
to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 
3706) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if the President 
determines that the country meets the eligibility requirements set forth 
in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703) and the eligibility criteria 
set forth in section 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
 14. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an eligible sub-Saharan 
African country if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.
 15. Section 112(c) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)), as added by section 
6002(a) of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (division D of 
title

[[Page 62]]

VI of Public Law 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922), provides special rules for 
certain apparel articles imported from lesser developed beneficiary sub-
Saharan African countries.
 16. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 
1974 Act, I have determined that the Union of the Comoros (Comoros) 
meets the eligibility requirements set forth or referenced therein, and 
I have decided to designate Comoros as an eligible sub-Saharan African 
country and beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
 17. I have further determined that Comoros satisfies the criterion for 
treatment as a lesser developed beneficiary sub- Saharan African country 
under section 112(c)(5)(D)(i) of the AGOA.
 18. On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican 
Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the 
``Agreement'') with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Congress approved the Agreement 
in section 101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United 
States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``CAFTA-DR Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 4011).
 19. Pursuant to section 403(a) of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4111(a)), 
the President is to report biennially to the Congress on the matters 
described in that section and, as the President deems appropriate, in 
section 403(b)(2) of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4111(b)(2)).
 20. Pursuant to section 403(a)(4) of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 
4111(a)(4)), the President is to establish a mechanism to solicit public 
comments on the matters described in section 403(a)(3)(D) of the CAFTA-
DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4111(a)(3)(D)).
 21. In Presidential Proclamation 8213 of December 20, 2007, I modified 
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) pursuant to 
section 1634 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280, 
120 Stat. 780) to carry out the understandings described in that 
section. Technical rectifications to the HTS are required to provide the 
intended tariff treatment.
 22. In Presidential Proclamation 8240 of April 17, 2008, pursuant to 
section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I modified the HTS to withdraw 
duty-free treatment for certain articles from Jamaica. A technical 
rectification to the HTS is required to provide the intended tariff 
treatment.
 23. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions 
of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions 
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to title V and 
section 604 of the 1974 Act, section 104 of the AGOA, section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code (3 U.S.C. 301), and section 403 of the 
CAFTA-DR Act, do proclaim that:

 (5) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act 
shall apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the

Act to the articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary 
developing countries listed in Annex IV to this proclamation are 
revoked.
 (7) The designation of Trinidad and Tobago as a beneficiary developing 
country for purposes of the GSP is terminated, effective on January 1, 
2010.

to the HTS is modified by deleting ``Trinidad and Tobago'' from the list

Proclamation 8273 of July 14, 2008

FBI Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For 100 years, the committed men and women of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation have worked diligently to deliver justice and keep 
Americans safe. On FBI Day, we recognize the Bureau's many 
accomplishments and pay tribute to all who have served in its ranks with 
valor and dedication.
The FBI traces its origins to 1908, when under the leadership of 
President Theodore Roosevelt and Attorney General Charles Bonaparte, a 
force of Special Agents was created, later to be called the Bureau of 
Investigation. As a Federal agency with the power to investigate crimes 
across State lines and enforce Federal law, the FBI has protected our 
country against threats from abroad and caught dangerous criminals like 
``Baby Face'' Nelson, John Dillinger, Ted Kaczynski, and Ramzi Yousef. 
Today, the FBI is charged with guarding our Nation from terrorist 
attacks, combating public corruption and organized crime, resisting 
cyber attacks, and opposing other high-technology crimes. The FBI also 
has a deep commitment to civil rights, helping protect the values we 
cherish.
With an abiding respect for the Constitution, the men and women of the 
FBI bring strength, impartiality, and devotion to their pursuit of 
justice. They continue to uphold their motto of ``Fidelity, Bravery, 
Integrity.'' On FBI Day, we especially remember the fallen agents who 
paid the ultimate price in serving our country and keeping our Nation 
safe.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2008, as FBI Day. 
I call upon all Americans to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8274 of July 18, 2008

Captive Nations Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Freedom is the longing of every soul and the birthright of all mankind. 
During Captive Nations Week, we underscore our commitment to advancing 
democracy, defending liberty, and protecting human rights around the 
world.

[[Page 69]]

It is in our Nation's interest to help those who are suffering under 
oppressive regimes defeat the ideologues of hate with an ideology of 
hope. Advancing the cause of liberty advances the cause of peace. A free 
society upholds justice and defends human dignity. Over the years, many 
have underestimated the power of freedom to overcome tyranny, but 
history has shown us that freedom will prevail.
In the 20th century, the evils of Soviet communism and Nazi fascism were 
defeated and freedom spread around the world as new democracies emerged. 
Today, our Nation faces new struggles with adversaries who murder the 
innocent and seek to subject millions to their violent, totalitarian 
rule. Still, we remain confident that the light of liberty will again 
overcome this darkness.
To bring that day about, we must support young democracies in places 
like Afghanistan and Iraq. In countries like Belarus, Burma, Cuba, Iran, 
North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and Zimbabwe, people continue to live under 
oppressive regimes, and we will work for the day when all these nations 
are free. By opposing these despots and helping young democracies grow, 
we will lay the foundation of peace and prosperity for generations to 
come. Throughout Captive Nations Week, we renew our pledge that as 
people across the world find their own paths to freedom, they will also 
find a friend in the United States of America.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week in July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 20 through July 26, 
2008, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United 
States to reaffirm our commitment to all those seeking liberty, justice, 
and self-determination.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8275 of July 23, 2008

60th Anniversary of the Integration of the United States Armed Forces

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United States is founded upon the belief that every person has 
unalienable rights and matchless value. Throughout our Nation's history, 
brave patriots have made great sacrifices to protect this ideal and to 
advance the cause of freedom around the world. On the 60th anniversary 
of the integration of the United States Armed Forces, we pay tribute to 
all our

[[Page 70]]

service members and veterans, and we underscore our Nation's commitment 
to equality.
On July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981, 
declaring ``that there shall be equality of treatment and opportunity 
for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, 
religion or national origin.'' Today, members of our Armed Forces come 
from many different backgrounds and cultures and are answering the call 
to service with bravery, decency, and resolve.
Our Nation has long drawn strength from the diversity of its citizens. 
Groups such as the Buffalo Soldiers, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, 
the Tuskegee Airmen, and the ``Borinqueneers'' risked their lives while 
proudly wearing the uniform of the United States. By performing their 
missions with integrity and honor, they highlighted the power of 
liberty, helped open the door of opportunity, and earned the respect and 
admiration of a grateful Nation.
On this anniversary, we celebrate the legacy of those who refused to 
allow adversity to diminish their spirit or extinguish their drive to 
help America live up to its promise of equality for all people. We also 
commemorate our veterans and service members whose noble and selfless 
actions have inspired generations of men and women to follow in their 
footsteps and made our country a more hopeful place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2008, as the 60th 
Anniversary of the Integration of the United States Armed Forces and 
urge all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8276 of July 24, 2008

Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has helped tear down barriers 
for millions of people living with disabilities. On the anniversary of 
this important legislation, our Nation underscores our commitment to 
ensuring that all individuals have an equal opportunity to realize their 
full potential.
On July 26, 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed this groundbreaking 
Act into law, better enabling citizens with disabilities to participate 
fully in all aspects of life. Over the course of nearly two decades, 
this Act has made our schools and workplaces more welcoming, helped 
change attitudes that once seemed unchangeable, and expanded opportunity 
for many

[[Page 71]]

exceptional Americans. The ADA is one of the most successful civil 
rights laws in our history and has been an essential part of countless 
American lives.
My Administration is committed to working to empower those with 
disabilities so that all our people can achieve the American dream. 
Building on the success of the ADA, the New Freedom Initiative of 2001 
has had a positive impact for many of our citizens. Technological 
advances have helped individuals gain greater access to everyday life. 
Students with disabilities are given the tools they need to succeed, and 
in the workplace, innovative hiring and employment practices are helping 
to integrate Americans with disabilities into the workforce. The Ticket 
to Work and AbilityOne programs have helped them become more self-
sufficient by expanding access to employment. Our Nation has benefited 
from the progress we have made since the enactment of the ADA, and it is 
our responsibility to continue working toward a country where all people 
are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.
On this anniversary, we highlight our commitment to the ADA and 
celebrate the progress that has been made toward full participation of 
people with disabilities in our society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2008, as a day in 
celebration of the 18th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. I call on all Americans to celebrate the vital contributions of 
individuals with disabilities as we work towards fulfilling the promise 
of the ADA to give all our citizens the opportunity to live with 
dignity, work productively, and achieve their dreams.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8277 of July 24, 2008

Parents' Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Parents teach their children timeless values to help them make the most 
of life's opportunities and overcome its challenges. On Parents' Day, we 
pay tribute to the parents who provide their children with guidance, 
support, and unconditional love and who help make our country a better 
place.
Mothers and fathers are a source of stability and great comfort in 
society, and they have a vital obligation to love and care for their 
children. Through patient instruction and a loving example, they instill 
in children the principles that make our Nation strong and ensure that 
children have the skills

[[Page 72]]

to lead lives of character and integrity. As a child's primary teachers, 
parents are responsible for their child's education, and their efforts 
will contribute to a more hopeful future for our country. Parents can 
help shape our Nation by encouraging young people to make the right 
choices, become responsible citizens, and achieve their dreams.
My Administration remains dedicated to promoting Federal, State, and 
faith-based and community programs to assist American families and 
support healthy marriages and responsible parenting. We are committed to 
helping parents and schools enable the next generation of Americans to 
realize their full potential.
On Parents' Day, we honor mothers and fathers and thank them for their 
many years of patience and selflessness. We take this opportunity also 
to recognize parents of adopted children and foster parents, who 
generously provide children with a loving family to call their own. We 
also recognize the parents who serve in our Armed Forces and the parents 
of the brave men and women wearing our Nation's uniform. The members of 
our Armed Forces are defending our freedom with dignity and honor, and 
America is grateful for the sacrifices that they and their families make 
in the name of duty.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, as 
amended, do hereby proclaim Sunday, July 27, 2008, as Parents' Day. I 
call upon citizens, private organizations, and governmental bodies at 
all levels to engage in activities and educational efforts that 
recognize, support, and honor parents, and I encourage American sons and 
daughters to convey their love, respect, and appreciation to their 
parents.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8278 of August 22, 2008

Women's Equality Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

With vision and determination, American women have helped build our 
great Nation. On Women's Equality Day, we remember the dedication of 
women who overcame many obstacles in order to secure the right to vote.
The struggle for women's rights is a story of strong women willing to 
take the lead and pave the way toward equal voting rights for all 
American citizens. In 1848, a group of determined women came together in 
Seneca Falls, New York, to proclaim that ``all men and women are created 
equal,'' and demand suffrage. On August 26, 1920, their voices were 
finally heard, and the 19th Amendment to the Constitution guaranteed 
women the right to vote.

[[Page 73]]

As we look back on the journey to women gaining suffrage, we remember 
the sacrifices of people like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton. More than 160 years after the Seneca Falls Convention, we 
celebrate the spirit, leadership, and hard work of those pioneering 
women. We also recognize the women who continue in this tradition by 
acting as role models in their communities, helping raise the next 
generation of Americans, leading in their professions, and serving in 
the Armed Forces protecting our country. These women are continuing on 
the path set by those who came before them, so that all Americans can 
realize the great promise of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2008, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
celebrate the achievements of women and observe this day with 
appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8279 of August 25, 2008

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is an opportunity to underscore 
our commitment to fighting prostate cancer and to raise awareness about 
this highly treatable disease.
Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer found in men, 
and one in six men will develop it during their lifetime. The cause of 
prostate cancer remains unknown, but early detection can lead to better 
treatment and increase the chances of survival. It is important for men 
to talk to their physicians about risk factors, prevention, and 
preventive screenings.
My Administration remains committed to helping America's dedicated 
medical professionals learn more about the cause of prostate cancer and 
develop new and better ways to combat it. Since 2005, the Cancer Genome 
Atlas has studied the genetic sources of all types of cancer. By 
supporting medical research, conducting clinical trials, and developing 
new surgical techniques to help patients recover quickly, the National 
Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention are helping lead the fight against 
prostate cancer.
During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we remember those who 
lost the battle against prostate cancer, and we pray for their families 
and friends. We also remember those living with prostate cancer, 
celebrate the lives of survivors, and thank all the medical 
professionals who aid in

[[Page 74]]

these victories. By continuing our fight against this disease, we will 
make our Nation a healthier and more hopeful place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2008 as National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, and the 
people of the United States to reaffirm our Nations strong and ongoing 
commitment to the fight against prostate cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8280 of August 25, 2008

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The opportunities of America make our land a beacon of hope for people 
from every corner of the world. America's minority-owned businesses 
contribute greatly to our economy and the richness of our country. 
During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we recognize minority 
entrepreneurs and recommit ourselves to fostering an environment where 
everyone can attain the American dream.
In America, people's dreams matter more than their background. Across 
our country, minority business owners are working hard to achieve their 
goals and helping to extend the promises of America to their fellow 
citizens. These businesses and their employees are vital contributors to 
our national prosperity.
My Administration has lowered taxes, supported pro-growth policies, and 
enacted an economic stimulus package to encourage small and medium-sized 
business growth. By keeping more money in the hands of families and 
small businesses, they can save, invest, spend, and give back to their 
communities. Our economy is resilient and dynamic because Americans are 
the most industrious, creative, and enterprising people in the world and 
because we believe in a free market economy that rewards those 
qualities.
During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we recognize the value 
minority entrepreneurs and their employees add to our country. They are 
vital to our Nation's economic strength and an essential part of our 
national heritage.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 31 through 
September 6, 2008, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon 
all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies,

[[Page 75]]

and activities to recognize the many contributions of our Nation's 
minority enterprises.

of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8281 of August 26, 2008

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we remember those whose 
lives have been affected by this deadly disease, and we underscore our 
commitment to battling ovarian cancer for the sake of women around the 
world.
Each year, thousands of American women are diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer. Many will lose their lives to this disease. Because ovarian 
cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, it is vital for women to 
make regular visits to their doctors for screenings and to discuss risk 
factors and warning signs. Early detection is the best way to help 
doctors diagnose cancer before it has a chance to spread. It also makes 
treatment more effective and increases the chances for survival. I 
encourage all women to learn more about preventive measures and 
screening options that may help to save their lives.
America leads the world in medical research, and my Administration 
remains dedicated to the fight against ovarian cancer. I signed the 
``Gynecologic Cancer Education and Awareness Act of 2005,'' or 
``Johanna's Law,'' that helps to raise awareness among women and health 
care providers about female reproductive cancers. Additionally, the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention are conducting important research to help make the 
innovative advances we need in order to eradicate this disease. NIH's 
Cancer Genome Atlas is also helping researchers gain a greater 
understanding of the genetic sources of cancer. Together, we will 
continue building on our progress until there is a cure for cancer. As 
we observe National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we honor those who 
have fought this disease. We also recognize the compassionate 
caregivers, doctors, and researchers who are dedicated to preventing, 
detecting, and treating ovarian cancer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2008 as 
National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government 
officials, businesses, communities, health care professionals, 
educators, volunteers, and the people of the United States to continue 
our Nation's strong commitment to preventing and treating ovarian 
cancer.

National Preparedness Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Preparedness Month, we underscore the important 
responsibility Americans have to be ready for emergencies in our homes, 
businesses, and communities.
The Department of Homeland Security's Ready campaign highlights 
preparedness steps, including having an emergency supply kit, making a 
family emergency plan, and becoming informed about different types of 
emergencies. After preparing themselves and their families, Americans 
can take the next step and get involved in helping to prepare their 
communities for all types of emergencies. For more information, citizens 
may visit www.ready.gov and citizencorps.gov.
During National Preparedness Month, we also honor our Nation's police 
officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel for their hard work and 
commitment to protecting others. As first responders, they have 
demonstrated the true meaning of heroism by taking great risks to 
safeguard our communities, and all Americans are grateful for their 
efforts.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2008 as National 
Preparedness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to 
recognize the importance of preparing for potential emergencies and to 
observe this month by participating in appropriate events, activities, 
and preparedness programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of

Proclamation 8283 of August 27, 2008

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Substance abuse is an unrelenting evil that destroys lives, ruins 
families, and endangers neighborhoods. During National Alcohol and Drug 
Addiction Recovery Month, we emphasize our commitment to alcohol and 
drug addiction prevention. This month is also an opportunity to 
recognize those who have had the courage to combat and overcome 
addiction.
Alcohol and drug abuse require an aggressive response. My Administration 
will continue to help educate our children through the National Youth 
Anti-Drug Media Campaign. This Campaign urges parents and adults to 
safeguard our young people from the abuse of prescription drugs, focuses 
on random drug-testing in schools and in the workplace, and creates 
drug-free community coalitions. First Lady Laura Bush leads the Helping 
America's Youth initiative, which assists our youth in making healthy 
life choices through the participation of caring adults in their lives. 
The dedicated efforts of families, teachers, law enforcement, faith-
based groups, and community activists are all important.
We are also working to reduce the supply of illegal drugs coming into 
our country and fighting demand here at home. In order to disrupt the 
market for illegal drugs, the National Drug Control Strategy report has 
coordinated law enforcement efforts throughout our Nation to help 
dismantle channels of distribution, and we are also working with foreign 
governments to eradicate the trafficking of illegal drugs.
Too many of our citizens have been swept up in a cycle of addiction. 
Through faith-based and community groups, we have revolutionized the way 
we help people break the chains of addiction. The Access to Recovery 
program provides addicts with vouchers so that they can attend the 
treatment center of their choice. Our Nation's armies of compassion have 
helped nearly 200,000 clients rediscover their dignity and purpose 
through this program.
During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month and throughout 
the year, we underscore the worthy mission of confronting substance 
abuse. This year's theme, ``Join the Voices of Recovery: Real People, 
Real Recovery,'' highlights the importance of providing hope and love to 
those who are trying to overcome drug and alcohol addiction and rebuild 
their lives. For more information on how to help fellow citizens and 
continue building a stronger community, visit recoverymonth.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2008 as National 
Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this month with the appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we pay special tribute 
to the thousands of innocent victims who died on September 11, 2001. Our 
Nation honors the brave citizens, service members, police officers, and 
firefighters who heroically responded in the face of terror. On these 
important days, we reflect on the terrible events of September 11, 2001, 
and lift the victims and their families in our prayers.
Our Nation will never forget the individuals who lost their lives in New 
York, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon. America remains inspired by the 
countless acts of kindness and sacrifice we saw that day--fearless 
rescuers who rushed toward danger, a beloved priest who died helping 
others, two office workers who carried a disabled person 68 floors to 
safety.
We also pray for the safety and success of the members of our Armed 
Forces now serving freedom's cause. We seek God's grace on their 
families, and commit to Heaven's care those brave men and women He has 
called home. We ask the Almighty to watch over America and pray for His 
providence and continued blessings on our country. May He always guide 
the United States of America. As we defend our country against its 
enemies, we pray for help in protecting the gift of freedom from those 
who seek to destroy it, and we ask the Almighty to strengthen all those 
securing liberty on distant shores.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 5, 
through Sunday, September 7, 2008, as National Days of Prayer and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States and their places 
of worship mark these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance with 
memorial services, the ringing of bells, and evening candlelight 
remembrance vigils. I also invite all people across the world to share 
in these Days of Prayer and Remembrance.

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are helping to 
extend lifelines of learning throughout our country. During Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities Week, we pay tribute to these 
distinguished institutions.
Our Nation's HBCUs help unlock the great potential within students by 
providing quality higher education to traditionally underserved 
communities. By offering all students an opportunity to develop their 
skills and talents, HBCUs are helping more Americans realize the promise 
of our Nation.
My Administration is committed to promoting equal opportunities and 
access to higher education for all students. Since 2001, funding for 
HBCUs and Historically Black Graduate Institutions has increased. 
Additionally, the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 makes 
college more affordable for low-income students by increasing funding 
for Federal Pell Grants by more than $11 billion. The Act also helps 
HBCUs increase educational opportunities in the critical fields of math, 
science, technology, and foreign languages. By educating all of 
America's students, we are investing in our next generation of leaders 
and contributing to a more hopeful people and a more prosperous America.
Throughout this week, we renew the call for this country to never rest 
until equality is real, opportunity is universal, and all citizens can 
realize their dreams. We also recognize our country's HBCUs and their 
important role in making these goals a reality.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 7 through 
September 13, 2008, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this week with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in respect and 
appreciation for the contributions these valuable institutions and their 
graduates have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8286 of September 8, 2008

Patriot Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

September 11, 2001, was etched into America's memory when 19 terrorists 
attacked us with barbarity unequaled in our history. On Patriot Day, we 
cherish the memory of the thousands of innocent victims lost, extend our 
thoughts and prayers to their families, and honor the heroic men and 
women who risked and sacrificed their lives so others might survive.
Since 9/11, we have recognized the threat posed by terrorists to the 
safety of the American people and worked to protect our homeland by 
fighting terrorists abroad. We are confronting terrorism by advancing 
freedom, liberty, and prosperity as an alternative to the ideologies of 
hatred and repression. Our Nation pays tribute to our courageous men and 
women in uniform serving around the world and the devoted members of our 
law enforcement, public safety, and intelligence communities at home who 
work night and day to protect us from harm and preserve the freedom of 
this great Nation.
Seven years ago, ordinary citizens rose to the challenge, united in 
prayer, and responded with extraordinary acts of courage, with some 
giving their lives for the country they loved. On Patriot Day, we 
remember all those who were taken from us in an instant and seek their 
lasting memorial in a safer and more hopeful world. We must not allow 
our resolve to be weakened by the passage of time. We will meet the test 
that history has given us and continue to fight to rid the world of 
terrorism and promote liberty around the globe.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as ``Patriot 
Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2008, as Patriot Day. I call 
upon the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of government, to 
direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Patriot Day. I also call 
upon the people of the United States to observe Patriot Day with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and remembrance services, to display 
the flag at half-staff from their homes on that day, and to observe a 
moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor 
the innocent Americans and people from around the world who lost their 
lives as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8287 of September 12, 2008

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we recognize the many Americans 
of Hispanic descent who have made outstanding contributions to our 
Nation.
The rich cultural traditions of the Hispanic-American community have 
made a remarkable impact on American society. The diverse backgrounds of 
Hispanic Americans and their dedication to family have become an 
integral part of America. With a deep commitment to faith and a strong 
desire to live the American dream, these citizens are realizing the full 
blessings of liberty. Educational opportunities are helping a new 
generation work toward success, and many Hispanic Americans operate 
thriving small businesses.
We also honor Hispanic Americans for their strong tradition of service 
in the Armed Forces. These proud patriots have fought in every war since 
our founding, and many have earned the Medal of Honor for their courage. 
Hispanic service men and women have shown their love for the United 
States by answering the call to serve, and we owe them and their 
families a tremendous debt of gratitude. Their patriotism and valor have 
added to the character of our Nation.
National Hispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity to celebrate the 
spirit and accomplishments of Hispanic Americans everywhere. To honor 
those achievements, the Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has 
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
designating September 15 through October 15 as ``National Hispanic 
Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through 
October 15, 2008, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon 
public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the 
United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8288 of September 12, 2008

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout history, America has counted on brave individuals willing to 
put on the uniform to protect our land and defend our way of life. This 
week we honor and recognize the many contributions members of our 
National Guard and Reserve make to our Nation, and we thank the civilian 
employers who support these individuals as they answer the call of duty.
The men and women of the National Guard and Reserve have demonstrated 
the highest form of citizenship, and their service is vital to the 
security of our country and the peace of the world. As the early 
patriots who claimed our Nation's liberty did, today's Guard and Reserve 
are fighting a new and unprecedented war and pledging their lives and 
honor to defend our freedom. As many of those early patriots did, 
members of today's Guard and Reserve lead civilian lives but stand ready 
to wear our Nation's uniform when liberty is threatened. The families of 
the National Guard and Reserve serve our Nation by proudly standing 
behind these brave men and women, and America appreciates their 
sacrifice as well.
In all they do, the National Guard and Reserve and their families 
represent the best of the American spirit.
Our Nation also depends on the commitment of the civilian employers of 
the members of the National Guard and Reserve. In offices and factories 
across America, organizations do without the talents of many hard-
working people who have been called upon to protect our country. Our 
Nation's employers provide time off, pay, healthcare benefits, and job 
security because they care about and love their country. These 
businesses have put patriotism above profit, and they deserve the 
gratitude of all Americans.
During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, a 
grateful country pays tribute to the men and women of the National Guard 
and Reserve, and we express our gratitude to the employers who support 
them and help enable them to serve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 14 through 
September 20, 2008, as National Employer Support of the Guard and 
Reserve Week. I encourage all Americans to join me in expressing our 
thanks to members of our National Guard and Reserve and their civilian 
employers for their patriotism and sacrifices on behalf of our Nation. I 
also call upon State and local officials, private organizations, 
businesses, and all military commanders to observe this week with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 8289 of September 17, 2008

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans are united by the ideals of equal justice, limited government, 
and the rule of law. On Constitution Day and Citizenship Day and during 
Constitution Week, we remember the vision and determination of the 
Framers to build a free society, and we celebrate the historical 
document they created to achieve that goal.
More than two centuries ago, our Founding Fathers gathered in 
Philadelphia and produced a charter that would promote justice and 
preserve the liberty of all our citizens. The Founders established three 
separate branches of Government with a system of checks and balances 
among them. Ours is the oldest written constitution in the world, and 
the American experiment remains the world's best hope for freedom.
The Constitution forged the American creed of liberty and equality and 
has lifted the lives of countless individuals. Whether they are citizens 
by birth or by oath, Americans share a great tradition of enjoying 
liberty protected by a constitutional government of their choosing.
On Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, and during Constitution Week, 
Americans come together and recognize the blessings bestowed upon our 
great Nation. On this occasion we celebrate the courage of the 
Constitution's drafters and recommit ourselves to making the United 
States a more perfect union.
In recognition of the signing of the Constitution and of Americans who 
strive to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, the 
Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106, as 
amended), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day and Citizenship 
Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108, as 
amended), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning 
September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2008, as Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2008, as 
Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as 
well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to 
conduct ceremonies and programs that celebrate our Constitution and 
reaffirm our rights and responsibilities as citizens of this great 
Nation.

Proclamation 8290 of September 17, 2008

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor the brave and patriotic 
Americans who were held as prisoners of war, and we remember those who 
are still missing in action. For their valor and selfless devotion to 
protect the country they love, our Nation owes them a debt we can never 
fully repay. On this day we underscore our commitment and pledge to 
those who are still missing in action and to their families that we will 
not rest until we have achieved the fullest possible accounting for 
every member of our Armed Forces missing in the line of duty.
To observe this important day, the National League of Families POW/MIA 
flag is flown over the Capitol, the White House, the World War II 
Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial, and other locations across our country. The flag is a solemn 
reminder of our Nation's enduring obligation and promise to our 
courageous service members who remain missing and a tribute to those who 
have been imprisoned while serving their country in conflicts around the 
world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 19, 
2008, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I call upon the people of the 
United States to join me in honoring and remembering all former American 
prisoners of war and those missing in action for their valiant service 
to our Nation. I also call upon Federal, State, and local government 
officials and private organizations to observe this day with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8291 of September 18, 2008

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Agriculture has always been a vital part of America's economy and 
culture, and our farmers and ranchers are among the best stewards of our 
land. During National Farm Safety and Health Week, we recognize those 
working in agriculture for their contributions to our Nation's 
prosperity, security, and health, and we also seek to raise awareness 
about the occupational hazards of this industry.
Farming and ranching are strenuous occupations, and workers can be 
exposed to many dangers, including those associated with extreme weather 
conditions, operating heavy machinery, and working with livestock. 
Teaching awareness about potential dangers, implementing preventative 
measures, and supervising children as they work and play can help 
mitigate risks and reduce the number of injuries and fatalities on farms 
and ranches.
Our Nation's farmers and ranchers exemplify the American values of hard 
work, deep commitment to faith, and love of family. During National Farm 
Safety and Health Week, we celebrate these extraordinary men and women 
who are building a prosperous future for our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 21 through 
September 27, 2008, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the agencies, organizations, and businesses that serve America's 
agricultural workers to continue to strengthen their commitment to 
promoting farm safety and health programs. I also urge all Americans to 
honor our agricultural heritage and to recognize our farmers and 
ranchers for their remarkable contributions to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8292 of September 19, 2008

Family Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Strong families are essential to the well-being of our Nation. On Family 
Day, we celebrate the relationship between parents and their children, 
and we recognize the importance of families spending time together.
As a source of hope, guidance, stability, and love for every generation, 
families both teach and exemplify the values and virtues needed in 
today's

[[Page 86]]

changing world. As parents and as role models to America's children, we 
can help prepare our children for a bright future by offering steadfast 
support and unconditional love.
The character of a child is formed in his or her earliest years by the 
love and guidance of family members and other caring individuals. Since 
2001, my Administration has worked to strengthen the American family, 
and we have worked with faith-based and community organizations to 
promote healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood. By striving to 
ensure that children remain connected to their families, communities, 
places of worship, and schools, we are helping them make good choices 
and build lives of purpose.
Parents are the primary teachers of our Nation's youth, and they are the 
first ones to educate them about the differences between right and 
wrong. By being proactive and involved in a child's life, families pass 
along the traditions and principles that help make America a 
compassionate, decent, and hopeful society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 22, 2008, as 
Family Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day by engaging in activities that strengthen the bonds between children 
and parents.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Gold Star Mother's Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, the men and women of the Armed Forces have put 
our Nation's security before their own, doing their duty in the face of 
grave danger. On Gold Star Mother's Day, we pay solemn tribute to the 
mothers of the patriots lost serving this great Nation.
Gold Star Mothers inspire our Nation with their deep devotion to family 
and country. These extraordinary women serve their communities, dedicate 
their time to helping members of our Armed Forces and veterans, and 
bring comfort and hope to families whose loved ones laid down their 
lives in the defense of our liberty. Nothing can compensate for their 
sacrifice and loss, yet Gold Star Mothers demonstrate tremendous courage 
and resolve while working to preserve the memory and legacy of all our 
fallen heroes.
On this day, we honor our country's Gold Star Mothers and remember their 
sons' and daughters' noble service and great sacrifice. We offer them 
our

[[Page 87]]

deepest gratitude and our most profound respect, and we ask for God's 
blessings to be upon them and their families.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold 
Star Mother's Day'' and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in its observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 28, 2008, as Gold Star 
Mother's Day. I call upon all Government officials to display the flag 
of the United States over Government buildings on this special day. I 
also encourage the American people to display the flag and hold 
appropriate ceremonies as a public expression of our Nation's sympathy 
and respect for our Gold Star Mothers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8295 of September 26, 2008

National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From our rugged peaks and mountains to our shining seas, our Nation is 
blessed with remarkable natural treasures. These magnificent landscapes 
are places where families and friends can create lasting memories and 
enjoy the outdoors. On National Hunting and Fishing Day, our country 
honors the many contributions of America's hunters and anglers, who add 
to our heritage and keep our wildlife populations healthy and strong.
Our Nation's sportsmen and women are among our foremost 
conservationists. They care deeply about our wildlife habitats, and they 
have contributed billions of dollars to wildlife restoration through the 
Pittman-Robertson Act, which is a levy on certain sporting goods. This 
investment has helped restore many species, including the American elk, 
black bear, and wild turkey. Through the Federal Waterfowl Stamp 
program, the conservation of habitats for migratory birds has been 
greatly improved. By protecting our Nation's wildlife, we can continue 
to advance the values of good stewardship.
My Administration has created, protected, and restored millions of acres 
of wetlands. Through my Ocean Action Plan, we are protecting fish 
populations and marine habitat. I was pleased to amend Executive Order 
12962 to recognize the value of recreational fishing as a sustainable 
activity in Federal waters. We have also improved the health of millions 
of acres of forests under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. This 
important legislation is helping to protect our public lands from the 
risk of catastrophic wildfires and contributes to a healthier 
environment for all Americans.
On this special day, we remember our responsibility to preserve the 
great American landscape for future generations, and we celebrate the 
joy of hunting and fishing in the great outdoors.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 27, 2008, as 
National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon the people of the United 
States to join me in recognizing the contributions of America's hunters 
and anglers, and all those who work to conserve our Nation's fish and 
wildlife resources.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

3. I have determined, and hereby certify, that Haiti and the Dominican

Proclamation 8297 of October 1, 2008

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we underscore our 
commitment to fighting and preventing this devastating disease. Breast 
cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women, and we 
must strengthen our support of those who are living with this disease 
while continuing to work toward a cure.
Breast cancer can be attributed to many factors, including age, 
genetics, obesity, and family history. Women who exercise regularly, 
maintain healthy diets, and have yearly visits with their doctors are 
less likely to get breast cancer. Various screening measures such as 
mammograms, regular breast self-exams, and clinical breast exams can 
help detect cancer before it has a chance to spread. Early detection 
allows for early intervention, helps make treatment more effective, and 
gives hope to patients and saves lives.
America leads the world in medical research, and my Administration will 
continue to support efforts to treat and cure breast cancer. Since 2005, 
the Cancer Genome Atlas has studied the genetic sources of all types of 
cancer, and last year, I signed the ``National Breast and Cervical 
Cancer Early Detection Program Reauthorization Act of 2007,'' which will 
help millions of low-income and uninsured women get the screenings they 
need to detect cancer early. First Lady Laura Bush has encouraged women 
around the world to take charge of their health and emphasized the 
importance of screenings and early detection. In partnership with 
Federal agencies, State health agencies, and other medical 
professionals, my Administration has taken action to improve our 
Nation's healthcare system and helped promote the prevention, detection, 
and treatment of breast cancer.
This month, we honor those currently battling the disease and all who 
have survived the fight against breast cancer. We are inspired by their 
strength and determination. We recognize and applaud the hard-working 
caregivers and researchers who are dedicated to providing comfort and 
assistance to those with breast cancer and to treating and curing this 
disease. We also remember those lost to breast cancer and extend our 
thoughts and prayers to their families.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2008 as 
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon Government 
officials, businesses, communities, health care professionals, 
educators, volunteers, and the people of the United States to continue 
our Nation's strong commitment to preventing, treating, and ultimately 
curing breast cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8298 of October 1, 2008

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we reaffirm our 
commitment to ensuring that our Nation's promise extends to all our 
citizens.
Millions of Americans live with disabilities, and many other Americans 
will become disabled at some point in their lives. To integrate people 
with disabilities more fully into every aspect of life, our country is 
working to advance greater freedoms at work, in schools, and throughout 
communities. By expanding employment opportunities and fighting false 
perceptions that hinder people living with disabilities from joining the 
workforce, we can uphold America's moral values, strengthen our economy, 
and make America a more hopeful place.
More than 7 years ago, my Administration announced the New Freedom 
Initiative, which expanded upon the landmark reforms of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act. Since then, the Initiative has increased access 
for people with disabilities through technology, provided additional 
educational opportunities for youth, and integrated more Americans into 
the workforce. My Administration remains committed to empowering all 
people to reach their full educational, social, and professional goals. 
To learn more about the Federal Government's disability-related 
programs, please visit DisabilityInfo.gov.
To recognize the contributions of Americans with disabilities and to 
encourage all citizens to ensure equal opportunity in the workforce, the 
Congress has designated October of each year (36 U.S.C. 121) as 
``National Disability Employment Awareness Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 2008 as National Disability 
Employment Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, labor 
leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8299 of October 1, 2008

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation has a moral obligation to work to prevent domestic violence 
and address its brutal and destructive effects. During National Domestic 
Violence Awareness Month, we underscore our commitment to helping 
individuals across our country who face such devastating violence.
My Administration remains dedicated to eradicating domestic violence and 
helping victims find the compassion, comfort, and healing they need. In 
2003, I announced the creation of the Family Justice Center Initiative 
to help local communities provide comprehensive services at one location 
for victims of domestic violence. In 2006, I was proud to sign 
legislation that reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act to improve 
criminal justice responses to domestic violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking. The Department of Justice's Domestic Violence Transitional 
Housing Assistance Program also offers victims of violence counseling 
and transitional housing services so they can escape the cycle of abuse.
During this month, we rededicate ourselves to protecting vulnerable 
members of our society and ensuring domestic abusers are punished to the 
full extent of the law. We encourage victims of domestic violence and 
their families to seek assistance through Family Justice Centers and the 
National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE. Together, we can 
help heal hearts and build a culture in which all Americans can pursue 
their dreams and realize the great promise of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2008, as National 
Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to reach out to 
victims of domestic violence and take action to make ending domestic 
violence a national priority.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8300 of October 3, 2008

Child Health Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans have a duty to promote the health and safety of our children. 
On Child Health Day, we affirm that all children are a precious gift, 
and we underscore our commitment to helping them realize their full 
potential.

[[Page 103]]

Families are the foundation of our society, and parents play the vital 
role of providing stability, guidance, and discipline so children can 
lead healthy lives. Teachers, caregivers, and mentors can also help 
teach children about the importance of making good choices. All 
Americans can help our Nation's youth become healthy and responsible 
adults by encouraging them to avoid risky behaviors such as early sexual 
activity, drugs, alcohol, and violence.
My Administration remains dedicated to helping younger generations 
achieve their dreams by supporting programs that encourage children to 
maintain healthy and active lifestyles. The Helping America';s Youth 
initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, is helping children make smart 
decisions so they can confront challenges and live longer and better 
lives. The HealthierUS initiative encourages positive habits and 
addresses public health issues facing our Nation's youth, such as 
childhood obesity. Through the President's Challenge, we are promoting 
personal fitness and encouraging youth to stay active beyond the school 
gym. Through these and other efforts, we can make our country stronger 
by teaching children the importance of healthy choices.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in 
October as ``Child Health Day'' and has requested the President to issue 
a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 6, 2008, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon families, schools, child health professionals, faith-
based and community organizations, and State and local governments to 
reach out to our Nation's young people, encourage them to avoid 
dangerous behavior, and help them make the right choices to achieve 
their dreams.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

For generations, German Americans have contributed to our Nation's 
identity, culture, and prosperity. On German-American Day, we recognize 
the many Americans with German ancestry who helped make our country 
great, and we celebrate our strong friendship with Germany.
The people of Germany and the United States share important family and 
cultural ties, and millions of American citizens are of German descent. 
Some of their forebears were among the first to settle Jamestown, and 
they and many others like them helped lay the foundation for our 
country, which has become the most prominent symbol of freedom in the 
world.

[[Page 104]]

 Many German Americans have shaped our way of life and added to our 
country's rich heritage.
In celebrating German-American Day, we honor generations of German 
Americans who came to our shores with dreams of opportunity and 
contributed to the greatness of our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2008, as

contributions German Americans have made to our Nation's liberty and 
prosperity.

Proclamation 8302 of October 3, 2008

Fire Prevention Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Fire Prevention Week is an opportunity to call attention to the 
importance of fire safety, especially in the home, and to honor our 
Nation's firefighters for their heroism.
Americans can help reduce home fires by taking simple steps such as 
regularly inspecting furnaces and fireplaces, keeping space heaters at 
least 3 feet from flammable materials, and checking the condition of 
electrical cords. Making sure that smoke alarms and fire extinguishers 
work can also help minimize the impact of home and building fires. I 
encourage all Americans to remember this year's theme--``It's Fire 
Prevention Week: Prevent Home Fires!''--and to check their homes for 
fire hazards to help prevent disasters.
Across our Nation, firefighters put themselves at risk to protect our 
communities, and their selfless dedication has saved countless lives. 
America's Bravest hold a cherished place in our hearts, and we honor 
those who have paid the ultimate price to protect citizens in harm's 
way. The sacrifice of these men and women is an inspiration to all and 
epitomizes the true meaning of heroism.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 5 through October 
11, 2008, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 5, 2008, in 
accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be 
flown at half staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the 
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans 
to participate in this observance through appropriate programs and 
activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their 
tragic consequences.

Proclamation 8303 of October 8, 2008

Leif Erikson Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Leif Erikson Day, we remember that son of Iceland and grandson of 
Norway for his journey to North America, and we celebrate the 
influential role Nordic Americans have played in our society.
Leif Erikson was among the world's greatest and most daring explorers. 
More than 1,000 years ago, he led a crew across the Atlantic to North 
America. Today, the same desire to explore and open new frontiers 
inspires our citizens and contributes to the strength of our Nation.
America's friendships with Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden 
are strong, and Nordic Americans have added to our rich cultural 
diversity and proud ancestry. On this day, we recognize these 
individuals for their remarkable achievements in all sectors of our 
society. America is grateful for the many contributions of Nordic 
Americans, and we continue to draw inspiration from the courage and 
optimism of the adventurous Leif Erikson.
To honor Leif Erikson and to celebrate our citizens of Nordic American 
heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved 
on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President to proclaim October 9 
of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

Proclamation 8304 of October 10, 2008

National School Lunch Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National School Lunch Week, we underscore the importance of 
providing America's children with access to nutritious meals and helping 
them develop good eating habits through the National School Lunch 
Program.
The National School Lunch Program is a federally assisted meal program 
administered by the Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition 
Service in cooperation with State agencies. Since 1946, the National 
School Lunch Program has served more than 187 billion lunches to 
students across America. The program is designed to ensure that each day 
millions of children are receiving the healthy food necessary to succeed 
by providing access to nutritious low-cost or free meals. By serving 
well-balanced meals that are lower in fat and have plenty of fruits, 
vegetables, and whole-grain foods, this program helps children learn 
healthy eating habits, reduce their risk of serious health problems, and 
perform better in the classroom.
Throughout National School Lunch Week, we recognize the school officials 
and parents who encourage young people to develop good eating habits. We 
also thank the dedicated food service professionals who serve our 
children healthy foods each day at school.
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch Program 
to the health, education, and well-being of America's children, the 
Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), as 
amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in 
October of each year as ``National School Lunch Week'' and has requested 
the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 12 through October 18, 
2008, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join 
the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch 
Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being 
of our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Columbus Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Christopher Columbus' bold voyage across the Atlantic changed the world 
forever. On Columbus Day, we remember this Italian explorer's courage in 
traveling to the unknown and celebrate his landmark achievements and 
lasting legacy.
History holds remarkable examples of heroism and adventure, and the 
journey of the navigator from Genoa in 1492 is one of history's great 
stories of daring and bravery. Columbus' expedition became an epic of 
discovery and opened up the New World for future generations. His 
journey will forever stand as a testament to his intrepid spirit and 
persistence. Today, his legacy of discovery and determination is an 
example for innovators and dreamers as they pursue broader understanding 
and use their talents to benefit humanity.
Columbus Day is also an opportunity to reaffirm the close ties between 
the United States and Italy. Our two countries will continue to work 
together to advance liberty, peace, and prosperity around the globe. Our 
Nation recognizes the many inspiring contributions made by Americans of 
Italian descent. We also honor the dedication and sacrifice of Italian 
Americans who are serving in our country's Armed Forces. In 
commemoration of Columbus' journey, the Congress has requested (36 
U.S.C. 107) that the President proclaim the second Monday of October of 
each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 13, 2008, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.

Proclamation 8306 of October 10, 2008

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we celebrate General Casimir Pulaski's 
selfless dedication to the cause of freedom during the American 
Revolution.

[[Page 108]]

In our Nation's struggle for independence, brave individuals such as 
Casimir Pulaski came to our shores and risked their lives to help bring 
liberty to a new continent. General Pulaski fought first against Russian 
domination of his Polish homeland and later joined General George 
Washington's Continental Army. Pulaski's valor in battle and love of 
freedom earned him the rank of Brigadier General and authority to 
organize an independent corps of cavalry. Through his skilled leadership 
and cavalry tactics he became known as the ``Father of the American 
Cavalry.'' During the siege of Savannah, General Pulaski was mortally 
wounded, making the ultimate sacrifice for our country and the cause of 
freedom.
General Pulaski's life exemplifies the courage and determination of the 
many Polish immigrants who have helped make the United States the 
greatest Nation on Earth. On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we recognize 
our time-honored friendship with Poland, and we are reminded of the 
great price our forefathers paid so that we might live in liberty.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2008, as 
General Pulaski Memorial Day. I urge Americans to commemorate this 
occasion with appropriate activities and ceremonies honoring General 
Casimir Pulaski and all those who defend our freedom.

Proclamation 8307 of October 13, 2008

White Cane Safety Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Compassion is one of our Nation's defining values, and we must work to 
ensure that all Americans are able to participate fully in society. The 
white cane allows many of our citizens who are blind or visually 
impaired to enjoy increased mobility. On White Cane Safety Day, we 
celebrate the symbolism of the white cane and highlight the importance 
of ensuring that individuals who are blind or visually impaired can live 
independently and realize their full potential.
Through the New Freedom Initiative, my Administration has put into 
action our strong commitment to helping more individuals with 
disabilities participate in all aspects of life. Since 2001, this 
initiative has built on the progress of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act and helped create greater access to schools, the workplace, and 
community life. These efforts are helping to remove barriers and

Proclamation 8308 of October 16, 2008

National Character Counts Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The strength of our Nation is found in the character of our citizens. 
During National Character Counts Week, we recommit ourselves to 
instilling strong values in our youth and encourage all Americans to 
develop good character.
Parents and families can teach children the timeless principles of 
respect, responsibility, honesty, commitment, and compassion. In our 
communities, parents, mentors, clergy members, teachers, coaches, and 
neighbors serve as role models by dedicating their time and talents to 
help others. At home and abroad, members of our Armed Forces exemplify 
the true character of our Nation by bravely protecting our freedom and 
serving a cause greater than self.
The Helping America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, 
connects young people with caring adults and community organizations 
that help them avoid risky behavior and achieve success. By becoming 
actively involved in the lives of children, we can help our young people 
make the right choices and lead lives of integrity and achievement.
National Character Counts Week is an opportunity for our citizens to 
reaffirm their responsibility to their communities and to recognize the 
importance of teaching strong values to our next generation of leaders. 
For more information on ways to set a positive example and make a 
lasting contribution to the future of our country, citizens can visit 
volunteer.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 19 through October 
25, 2008, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public 
officials, educators, librarians, parents, students, and all Americans 
to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

Proclamation 8309 of October 16, 2008

National Forest Products Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Forest Products Week, we highlight our country's 
commitment to protect and wisely use America's forests for our Nation's 
prosperity and well-being.
Across our country, citizens rely on forest products to meet their daily 
needs. Our forests enable us to produce goods such as paper and 
furniture, provide raw materials such as lumber for homes and buildings, 
and offer job opportunities that bring economic security for many 
Americans.
My Administration is steadfast in its commitment to protect our forests 
from both manmade and natural harm. It is vital that we continue to make 
progress in conserving our natural resources and using them responsibly. 
Since 2002, we have worked to restore our forests and protected them 
against catastrophic fires as part of the Healthy Forests Initiative. 
Americans take great pride in our country's natural splendor, and by 
working together to be good stewards of the environment, we can leave 
our children and grandchildren a healthy and flourishing land.
Recognizing the importance of our forests in ensuring our Nation's well-
being, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, 
has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each 
year as ``National Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 19 through October 25, 2008, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8310 of October 23, 2008

United Nations Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On October 24, 1945, in the wake of the devastation left by World War 
II, the United Nations was formally established. Today, we recognize the 
many contributions of the United Nations and renew our commitment to its 
founding principles.
Sixty-three years ago, representatives from around the world completed 
the founding charter of the United Nations and pledged to reaffirm faith 
in fundamental human rights and to unite their strength to maintain 
international peace and security. It is vital that this noble pledge 
continue to guide the United Nations throughout the 21st century. By 
taking an unequivocal stand against terrorists, those who traffic in 
persons, and all who exploit the poor, the needy, and the marginalized, 
the United Nations can live up to the noble ideals of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights.
The United Nations is an organization with extraordinary potential for 
good works. On United Nation's Day, we recommit ourselves to reforming 
the U.N., ensuring the highest standards are upheld throughout the 
organization, and renewing the principals of its charter for the 21st 
century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2008, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor 
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas 
under the flag of the United States to observe United Nations Day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

National Family Caregivers Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Family Caregivers Month we recognize and celebrate the 
many individuals throughout our country who work each day to ensure a 
better quality of life for their family members. Through their selfless 
action, these caregivers provide their loved ones support and comfort as 
they age, combat illness, or suffer from disability.
Our Nation is compassionate, and we believe in the sanctity of life at 
all stages. Through tireless efforts and inspiring deeds, many Americans 
care

[[Page 112]]

for loved ones in need. By acting as in-home care providers, people 
across our Nation are helping to ensure that their family members are 
provided with love, comfort, and security. My Administration has worked 
to offer caregivers support and training. In 2006, I signed the Lifespan 
Respite Care Act of 2006, which established a program to help family 
caregivers get access to affordable and high-quality respite care. In 
addition, the National Family Caregiver Support Program encourages 
cooperation among government agencies and other organizations that 
support and work with family caregivers.
National Family Caregivers Month is an opportunity to recognize those 
who serve a cause greater than self and contribute to the well-being of 
their loved ones. Family caregivers are soldiers in America's armies of 
compassion and set an inspiring example for their fellow citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2008 as National 
Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to honor the selfless 
service of caregivers who support their loved ones in need.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8312 of October 29, 2008

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we recognize the 
dignity and courage of the men and women living with Alzheimer's 
disease. We also honor the devoted family members and caretakers who 
bring them love and comfort, and we underscore our dedication to finding 
a cure for this tragic disease.
Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that seriously impairs a 
person's ability to function normally. Age is the most important known 
risk factor, and scientists are studying the role that genetics, 
education, diet, and environment might play in the development of this 
debilitating disease. Through research supported by the National 
Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs, we are 
learning more about the disease and enhancing the quality of life for 
those affected. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services 
is improving the delivery of home and community-based services to people 
with Alzheimer's.
National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month is an opportunity to pay 
tribute to the courageous individuals facing this disease and remember 
the precious lives lost due to Alzheimer's. All Americans appreciate the 
strong

[[Page 113]]

support and dedication of the families, medical professionals, 
scientific researchers, and caregivers who are helping build a society 
that values the life and dignity of every person.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2008 as National 
Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.

Proclamation 8313 of October 30, 2008

National American Indian Heritage Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National American Indian Heritage Month, we celebrate the rich 
ancestry of American Indians and Alaska Natives and recognize their many 
contributions to our national story.
Native Americans have enriched our heritage and added to all aspects of 
our society. Our country is blessed to have their character and 
strength, and we are especially grateful for the generations of Native 
Americans who have answered the call to defend our country. During World 
War II, these brave patriots used their native languages to create an 
unbreakable oral code. Today, that legacy continues as Native Americans 
work to advance freedom's cause.
My Administration remains committed to protecting tribal sovereignty and 
the right to self-determination and to working with tribes on a 
government-to-government basis. To help more Native Americans realize 
the dream of home ownership, I signed the Native American Housing 
Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2008. For 
nearly eight years, we have also worked to strengthen educational 
opportunities for all Americans. In 2004, I issued an executive order to 
help Native American students fulfill the challenging standards of the 
No Child Left Behind Act. This order established the Interagency Working 
Group on American Indian and Alaska Native Education to improve 
educational programs consistent with tribal traditions, languages, and 
cultures. By setting high standards for academic achievement, we are 
enabling more Americans throughout our country to pursue their dreams. 
During this month, we honor our native peoples and recognize them for 
strengthening the diversity of our society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2008 as National

[[Page 114]]

American Indian Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate 
this month with appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 8314 of October 30, 2008

National Diabetes Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Many Americans, of all ages and backgrounds, are affected by diabetes. 
National Diabetes Month is an opportunity to inform individuals about 
the risk factors, prevention, and treatment of this serious disease.
Diabetes is a debilitating disease that results from the body's 
inability to produce or use insulin effectively. Type 1 diabetes, once 
known as juvenile diabetes, usually affects children and young adults 
who are dependant on medication for their lack of insulin. The most 
common form of diabetes is Type 2 diabetes. Family history and lifestyle 
risk factors contribute to the possibility of developing Type 2 
diabetes. Regular physical activity, healthy eating habits, and 
consultation with a doctor can help prevent and reduce the effects of 
this disease.
My Administration is committed to preventing diabetes and finding a cure 
for this disease. We have provided substantial funding for diabetes 
education programs and research initiatives. Through the Department of 
Health and Human Services and other organizations, the National Diabetes 
Education Program is helping increase awareness among Americans about 
the risk factors of diabetes and the benefits of making healthy choices. 
Our Nation must continue to support initiatives that will help turn 
today's research opportunities into tomorrow's medical success stories.
During National Diabetes Month, we celebrate the medical professionals, 
researchers, and all those whose time, talents, and energy support the 
fight against diabetes. Through these efforts and enhanced public 
awareness of this serious disease, we will work to continue to bring the 
hope of a healthier future to more Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2008 as National 
Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the risk 
factors and symptoms associated with diabetes and to observe this month 
with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8315 of October 31, 2008

National Adoption Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Adoption Month, we recognize the compassion of adoptive 
and foster families as we seek to raise awareness of the need for every 
child in America to have a safe, loving, and permanent home.
Adopting a child is a great joy and also a great responsibility. Parents 
are a child's first teachers, and adoptive families can help children 
learn character and values, the importance of giving back to their 
community and country, and the courage to realize their potential. On 
November 15, caring parents across our Nation will celebrate National 
Adoption Day by finalizing their adoptions and bringing home children in 
need of a hopeful life.
My Administration is committed to helping young people find the love, 
stability, and support that a family can provide. We have joined with 
community and faith-based organizations to raise public awareness of 
foster children awaiting adoption. With the help of the Congress, we are 
assisting families in overcoming the financial barriers to adopting 
children through programs such as the Adoption Incentives Program. In 
addition, the Collaboration to AdoptUsKids project, which can be found 
at adoptuskids.org, provides guidance and resources for parents 
exploring adoption.
During National Adoption Month, we honor adoptive and foster parents who 
have shown America the depth and kindness of the human heart. Their love 
and dedication inspire the next generation of Americans to achieve their 
dreams and demonstrate the true spirit of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2008 as National 
Adoption Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities to honor adoptive families and to 
participate in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8316 of October 31, 2008

National Hospice Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Hospice Month, we honor the dedicated health care 
professionals and volunteers who help the terminally ill spend their 
final days

[[Page 116]]

in comfort and with dignity. Hospice care providers and other 
compassionate individuals are a constant reminder that the greatness of 
America lies in the hearts and souls of its citizens.
Americans believe that every person has matchless value throughout all 
of life's stages. Hospice physicians, nurses, counselors, and volunteers 
put this belief into action by using their talents and energy to care 
for those who are terminally ill and by providing support and comfort to 
their loved ones. As an alternative to traditional services, hospice 
care frequently provides assistance in the home so that patients can be 
surrounded by family and friends. Hospice counselors offer guidance to 
patients, as well as to those close to them, as they deal with grief, 
anxiety, and other end-of-life issues. Through these and countless other 
acts of compassion, our Nation's hospice caregivers lift up souls, offer 
peace of mind, and strengthen America's culture of life.
Throughout National Hospice Month, we recognize hospice care 
professionals and volunteers for their selfless efforts to provide 
physical, psychological, and spiritual assistance to terminally ill 
patients and their families.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2008 as National 
Hospice Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities. I also ask Americans to recognize 
our health care professionals and volunteers for their contributions to 
helping provide comfort and care to those facing terminal illness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Veterans Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Veterans Day, we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the men 
and women who in defense of our freedom have bravely worn the uniform of 
the United States.
From the fields and forests of war-torn Europe to the jungles of 
Southeast Asia, from the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of 
Afghanistan, brave patriots have protected our Nation's ideals, rescued 
millions from tyranny, and helped spread freedom around the globe. 
America's veterans answered the call when asked to protect our Nation 
from some of the most brutal and ruthless tyrants, terrorists, and 
militaries the world has ever known. They stood tall in the face of 
grave danger and enabled our Nation to become the greatest force for 
freedom in human history. Members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, 
and Coast Guard have answered a high calling to serve and have helped 
secure America at every turn.

[[Page 117]]

Our country is forever indebted to our veterans for their quiet courage 
and exemplary service. We also remember and honor those who laid down 
their lives in freedom's defense. These brave men and women made the 
ultimate sacrifice for our benefit. On Veterans Day, we remember these 
heroes for their valor, their loyalty, and their dedication. Their 
selfless sacrifices continue to inspire us today as we work to advance 
peace and extend freedom around the world.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service 
members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor America's 
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2008, as Veterans Day and urge 
all Americans to observe November 9 through November 15, 2008, as 
National Veterans Awareness Week. I encourage all Americans to recognize 
the bravery and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and 
prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the 
flag of the United States and to support and participate in patriotic 
activities in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal 
organizations, places of worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the 
media to support this national observance with commemorative expressions 
and programs.

Proclamation 8318 of November 7, 2008

World Freedom Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On World Freedom Day, we celebrate the anniversary of the historic fall 
of the Berlin Wall and honor the brave citizens of East and West Germany 
who helped secure freedom and liberty for future generations.
The Berlin Wall stood as a barrier that isolated the victims of imperial 
Communism and totalitarian power from the promise of the free world. 
Standing in the presence of the wall, with an unshakable belief in the 
power of liberty, President Ronald Reagan issued a resounding challenge 
on behalf of the free and the unfree alike: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down 
this wall.'' On November 9, 1989, the citizens of East Germany finally 
triumphed over their Communist oppressors, and the Berlin Wall came 
tumbling down. As the hope of freedom spread, the Soviet empire 
collapsed, the Iron Curtain was lifted, and Eastern and Central Europe 
were liberated from decades of cruel tyranny.
The Cold War demonstrated once again that freedom is precious and cannot 
be taken for granted, that evil is real and must be confronted, and that 
if they are allowed to do so, harsh rulers will subjugate others in the 
name

[[Page 118]]

of hateful ideologies. History has also proven that the transformative 
power of liberty overcomes this oppression. Today, many former Communist 
countries are using their sovereignty to aid the rise of other young 
democracies and to shine the light of conscience on human rights abuses. 
Our belief in the universality of freedom is challenged time and again, 
but we continue to go forward with confidence that free nations will 
always prevail over the enemies of liberty, peace, and justice.
On World Freedom Day, we are reminded that injustice overseas can 
threaten our way of life at home, and we renew our commitment to helping 
those who suffer under the weight of oppression.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2008, as World 
Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our 
dedication to freedom and democracy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

America Recycles Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On America Recycles Day, we highlight the importance of recycling as a 
way to safeguard and protect the environment and preserve our precious 
natural resources.
We live in a country of splendor and beauty, and no matter which State 
each of us calls home, we all have a responsibility to practice good 
environmental stewardship. It is in our Nation's best interest that 
government, businesses, community organizations, and individuals work 
together to conserve our natural resources. The Environmental Protection 
Agency, through its Resource Conservation Challenge, is encouraging 
communities to increase recycling collection. Through the Plug-In To 
eCycling Campaign, we are working to make it easier for Americans to 
donate or safely recycle old electronics, including TVs, computers, and 
cell phones. By recycling we can strengthen local economies, reduce 
greenhouse gases, conserve natural resources, and save landfill space. 
Using our resources wisely, we can make our communities more livable and 
our world a cleaner place for our children and grandchildren.
On this day, we remember our opportunity to preserve the great American 
landscape through recycling. By continuing to work together, we can 
maintain and enjoy the beauty of our land for generations to come.

Proclamation 8320 of November 19, 2008

National Farm-City Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Farmers and ranchers display the values of hard work and good 
stewardship, and National Farm-City Week is an opportunity to recognize 
these individuals and their urban partners for contributing to our 
Nation's well-being.
Farming, America's first industry, helps feed and clothe our citizens 
and increasingly provides more of our energy. The agricultural sector 
also employs more than a million people across our Nation. Farming has 
been a cornerstone of our country since its founding and continues to be 
a vital part of our economy.
Our farmers and ranchers provide a safe, healthy, and abundant food 
supply, yet they could not succeed in doing so without essential 
partnerships with urban communities to supply, sell, and deliver 
finished products across our country and around the world. These 
cooperative efforts help to create a prosperous future for our citizens 
and people everywhere.
Since 2001, my Administration has been committed to strengthening our 
agricultural sector, and we have worked to create an environment that 
will stimulate growth by opening new markets, encouraging free and fair 
trade, and keeping taxes low. As we celebrate this week, we recognize 
the vital work of farmers and ranchers, and we pay tribute to all those 
who strengthen the relationships between our rural and urban 
communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21 through 
November 27, 2008, as National Farm-City Week. I encourage all Americans 
to join in recognizing farmers, ranchers, and all those who contribute 
to the strength of America's agricultural industry.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Proclamation 8321 of November 20, 2008

National Family Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Family Week, we reflect on the important values and 
character that families instill in their children and in our society.
Families offer a stable and nurturing environment for children by 
providing support and comfort. A child's parents, siblings, 
grandparents, aunts and uncles, and other family members show them love 
and teach them right from wrong. Strong families set a positive example 
and help young people grow into compassionate and responsible citizens.
My Administration believes families strengthen our communities and help 
shape the character and future of our Nation. Over the years, we have 
demonstrated our deeply held commitment to supporting America's families 
by signing laws that respect the sanctity of life, lower taxes, double 
the child tax credit, reduce the marriage penalty, and empower parents 
to make choices about their children's education. In addition, the 
Helping America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, is 
dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of positive youth 
development by keeping children connected to family, school, and 
community.
National Family Week is also a time to show our appreciation to our 
Nation's military families. We recognize their sacrifices, and we pray 
for their loved ones in the Armed Forces who are laying a foundation of 
peace for future generations. We owe a debt of gratitude to the brave 
men and women who have answered the call to serve our country and their 
families who support them.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 23 through 
November 29, 2008, as National Family Week. I invite the States, 
communities, and all the people of the United States to join together in 
observing this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor 
our Nation's families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the

Thanksgiving Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Thanksgiving is a time for families and friends to gather together and 
express gratitude for all that we have been given, the freedoms we 
enjoy, and the loved ones who enrich our lives. We recognize that all of 
these blessings, and life itself, come not from the hand of man but from 
Almighty God.
Every Thanksgiving, we remember the story of the Pilgrims who came to 
America in search of religious freedom and a better life. Having arrived 
in the New World, these early settlers gave thanks to the Author of Life 
for granting them safe passage to this abundant land and protecting them 
through a bitter winter. Our Nation's first President, George 
Washington, stated in the first Thanksgiving proclamation that ``It is 
the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, 
to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and humbly to implore 
His protection and favor.'' While in the midst of the Civil War, 
President Abraham Lincoln revived the tradition of proclaiming a day of 
thanksgiving, asking God to heal our wounds and restore our country.
Today, as we look back on the beginnings of our democracy, Americans 
recall that we live in a land of many blessings where every person has 
the right to live, work, and worship in freedom. Our Nation is 
especially thankful for the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who 
protect these rights while setting aside their own comfort and safety. 
Their courage keeps us free, their sacrifice makes us grateful, and 
their character makes us proud. Especially during the holidays, our 
whole country keeps them and their families in our thoughts and prayers. 
Americans are also mindful of the need to share our gifts with others, 
and our Nation is moved to compassionate action. We pay tribute to all 
caring citizens who reach out a helping hand and serve a cause larger 
than themselves.
On this day, let us all give thanks to God who blessed our Nation's 
first days and who blesses us today. May He continue to guide and watch 
over our families and our country always.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 27, 2008, as a 
National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all Americans to gather 
together in their homes and places of worship with family, friends, and 
loved ones to strengthen the ties that bind us and give thanks for the 
freedoms and many blessings we enjoy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8323 of November 25, 2008

To Provide for Duty-Free Treatment Under the Earned Import Allowance 
Program, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 1. Section 404 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``CAFTA-DR Act''), as added 
by section 2 of Public Law 110-436, 122 Stat. 4976, provides for 
preferential tariff treatment of eligible apparel articles wholly 
assembled in an eligible country and imported directly from an eligible 
country, if such articles are accompanied by an earned import allowance 
certificate issued under a program established by the Secretary of 
Commerce.
 2. Section 404(e)(1) of the CAFTA-DR Act, as amended, provides that the 
program providing this preferential treatment shall be in effect for the 
10-year period beginning on the date on which the President certifies to 
the appropriate congressional committees that sections A, B, C, and D of 
the Annex to Presidential Proclamation 8213 of December 20, 2007, have 
taken effect.
 3. On August 7, 2008, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) 
published a notice in the Federal Register (73 FR 46057) announcing that 
August 15, 2008, would be the effective date for sections A, B, C, and D 
of the Annex to Presidential Proclamation 8213.
 4. I have determined, and hereby certify, that the provisions of 
Proclamation 8213 referenced in section 404(e)(1) of the CAFTA-DR Act, 
as amended, have taken effect.
 5. Section 6002 of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 
(division D, title VI of Public Law 109-432) (the ``2006 Act'') amended 
section 112(c) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (19 
U.S.C. 3721(c)) to modify the preferential tariff treatment accorded to 
designated lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.
 6. Pursuant to section 6002 of the 2006 Act, in Proclamation 8114 of 
March 19, 2007, I proclaimed modifications to the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTS) to provide the tariff treatment 
authorized by the 2006 Act. The HTS provisions proclaimed in 
Proclamation 8114 were modified by Proclamation 8157 of June 28, 2007, 
and Proclamation 8240 of April 17, 2008, to provide the tariff treatment 
authorized by the 2006 Act.
 7. Section 3 of Public Law 110-436 amends section 112(c) of the AGOA to 
modify the tariff treatment applicable to lesser developed beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African countries, and to provide that Mauritius is to be 
treated as a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country 
for purposes of the AGOA.
 8. Accordingly, in order to reflect the amendments to section 112(c) of 
the AGOA, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the HTS to 
reflect the tariff treatment provided to lesser developed beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African countries and to provide that Mauritius is to be 
treated as a

[[Page 123]]

lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of 
the AGOA.
 9. Section 203(e)(1)(A)(i) of the Andean Trade Preference Act, as 
amended (ATPA) (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(1)(A)(i)), authorizes the President to 
withdraw or suspend the designation of any country as a beneficiary 
country for purposes of the ATPA if, after such designation, the 
President determines that as a result of changed circumstances such 
country should be barred from designation as a beneficiary country.
10. Section 3103 of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act 
(Title XXXI of the Trade Act of 2002, Public Law 107-210) (ATPDEA) 
amended section 203(e)(1) of the ATPA (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(1)) by adding a 
new subparagraph (B)(i) authorizing the President to withdraw or suspend 
the designation of any country as a beneficiary country for purposes of 
the ATPDEA if, after such designation, the President determines that, as 
a result of changed circumstances, the performance of such country is 
not satisfactory under the eligibility criteria set forth in section 
204(b)(6)(B) of the ATPA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3203(b)(6)(B)).
 11. Section 203(e)(2)(A) of the ATPA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
3202(e)(2)(A)) requires the President to publish notice of the action he 
proposes to take at least 30 days before taking action under section 
203(e)(1) (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(1)).
 12. On October 1, 2008, the USTR, at my direction, published a notice 
in the Federal Register (73 FR 57158) announcing that I proposed to 
suspend the designation of Bolivia as a beneficiary country for purposes 
of the ATPA and the ATPDEA based on Bolivia's failure to satisfy the 
eligibility criteria set forth in section 203(d)(11) and section 
204(b)(6)(B)(v) of the ATPA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3202(d)(11), 
3203(b)(6)(B)(v)).
 13. I have determined that Bolivia no longer satisfies the eligibility 
criterion in section 203(d)(11) of the ATPA, as amended. Therefore, 
pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(A)(i) of the ATPA, I have determined that, 
as a result of this changed circumstance, Bolivia's designation as an 
ATPA beneficiary country should be suspended.
 14. I have determined that Bolivia is no longer performing 
satisfactorily under the eligibility criterion in section 
204(b)(6)(B)(v) of the ATPA, as amended. Therefore, pursuant to section 
203(e)(1)(B)(i) of the ATPA, I have determined that, as a result of this 
changed circumstance, Bolivia's designation as an ATPDEA beneficiary 
country should be suspended.
 15. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182) (the ``NAFTA Implementation 
Act''), incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of 
origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
 16. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) 
provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United 
States originate in the territory of a NAFTA country and thus are 
eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the 
NAFTA. Section 202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 
3332(q)) authorizes the President to proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the 
rules of origin set out in the NAFTA, and to proclaim modifications to 
such previously proclaimed

[[Page 124]]

rules of origin, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of 
section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3313(a)).
 17. The United States and Canada have agreed to modify certain NAFTA 
rules of origin and to apply the modified rules to their bilateral 
trade. It is therefore necessary to modify the NAFTA rules of origin set 
out in Proclamation 6641.
 18. Section 1230 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (Public 
Law 109-432) temporarily modified the rate of duty on triphenyl 
phosphine. Modifications to the HTS are necessary to provide the 
intended tariff treatment.
19. Presidential Proclamation 7011 of June 30, 1997, implemented the 
World Trade Organization Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information 
Technology Products for the United States. Annex 1 to that proclamation 
failed to include certain products. Technical corrections and conforming 
changes to the HTS are necessary to provide the intended tariff 
treatment for those products.
 20. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483) 
(the ``1974 Act''), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting 
import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including section 404 of the 
CAFTA-DR Act, as amended, section 104 of the AGOA, section 202 of the 
NAFTA Implementation Act, section 203 of the ATPA, as amended, section 
604 of the 1974 Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do 
proclaim that:
(1) In order to provide the tariff treatment for eligible articles 
provided for in section 404 of the CAFTA-DR Act, as added by Public Law 
110-436, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex A to this 
proclamation.
 (2) In order to reflect changes to the tariff treatment for certain 
apparel products under the AGOA, U.S. note 5 to subchapter XIX of 
chapter 98 of the HTS, subheadings 9819.15.10 through 9819.15.42, 
inclusive, and the superior text thereto are deleted from the HTS, 
effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after October 31, 2008.
(3) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, as amended, Mauritius is 
included as a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country 
effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after October 31, 2008.
 (4) The designation of Bolivia as a beneficiary country for purposes of 
the ATPA and ATPDEA is suspended effective on December 15, 2008. 
Accordingly, effective on that date, general note 11(a) to the HTS is 
modified by deleting ``Bolivia'' from the list of ATPA beneficiary 
countries. Further, general note 11(d) to the HTS is modified by 
deleting ``Bolivia'' from the list of ATPDEA beneficiary countries. In 
addition, U.S. note 1 to subchapter XXII of chapter 98 of the HTS is 
modified by removing ``Bolivia'' from the list of ATPDEA beneficiary 
countries.

[[Page 125]]

(5) In order to modify the rules of origin under the NAFTA, general note 
12 to the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex B to this proclamation.
(6) (a) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex A to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date set forth 
in Annex A.
     (b) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex B to this 
proclamation shall enter into effect on the date that the USTR announces 
in a notice published in the Federal Register that Canada has completed 
its applicable domestic procedures to give effect to corresponding 
modifications to be applied to goods of the United States and shall be 
effective with respect to goods of Canada entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after the date indicated in the notice.
(7) In order to provide the intended tariff treatment to triphenyl 
phosphine and to correct the error identified in paragraph 19, the HTS 
is modified as provided in Annex C to this proclamation.
(8) The modifications to the HTS made in Annex C to this proclamation 
shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after the date set out in that Annex.
(9) The USTR shall notify the Congress of this proclamation and my 
certification as provided in section 404(e) of the CAFTA-DR Act, as 
amended.
(10) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day 
of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8324 of November 26, 2008

National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, we 
underscore our commitment to raising awareness about the tragedies that 
often result from driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Nearly 13,000 Americans died last year as a result of drunk driving. 
During the holidays, people are more likely to drive in an impaired 
state, and in order to better protect our citizens this holiday season, 
we must educate all Americans about the seriousness of this offense and 
its devastating consequences. Individuals across America can help 
prevent drunk and drugged driving by making responsible choices, 
identifying sober designated drivers, and educating young people about 
ways to avoid drunk and drugged driving. All Americans can work together 
to make our roads safer and help save lives by preventing others from 
driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs.
My Administration is committed to keeping our citizens safe from drunk 
and drugged drivers this holiday season. The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration (NHTSA) is raising public awareness through 
advertising, urging the increased use of ignition interlocks, and 
encouraging greater law enforcement presence. The NHTSA has extended 
their ``Drunk Driving. Over the Limit. Under Arrest.'' campaign through 
the holiday season, and we must continue to be vigilant in stopping 
impaired driving throughout the year. In addition, the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy is working hard to ensure that our law 
enforcement officers have the tools they need to detect when drivers are 
under the influence of drugs.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2008 as National 
Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. I encourage all Americans to 
help keep our Nation's roads safe by making responsible choices and 
taking appropriate measures to prevent drunk and drugged driving.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8325 of November 26, 2008

World AIDS Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, we believe in the inherent dignity and value of every man, 
woman, and child. On World AIDS Day, we recommit ourselves to the global 
challenge of combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and to showing our 
compassion for those affected here at home and around the world.
The fight against HIV/AIDS is a noble and necessary battle. As part of 
this fight, in 2003 my Administration launched the President's Emergency 
Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Through this program, the United States 
has partnered with other countries, local communities, and faith-based 
organizations around the world to support HIV/AIDS treatment, care, and 
prevention activities. In July 2008, we worked with the Congress to 
reauthorize this important program for another 5 years.
PEPFAR is the largest international commitment in history by any nation 
to combat a single disease, and so far the results are promising. PEPFAR 
has supported care for millions of people around the world. We have also 
made great strides in the fight against HIV/AIDS through PEPFAR's 
commitment to evidence-based prevention interventions, including the ABC 
approach: abstinence, be faithful, and correct and consistent condom 
use. PEPFAR is spreading hope around the world by saving lives and 
showing the good heart of our Nation.
To advance our domestic battle against HIV/AIDS, we must continue to 
research and develop new methods of treatment and prevention. In 2006, 
the Congress reauthorized the Ryan White CARE Act. This legislation also 
focuses on life-saving and life-extending services, increased 
accountability for funding, and supports HIV testing to prevent the 
further spread of this disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2008, as World 
AIDS Day. On this day and throughout the year, the red ribbon is a 
symbol that helps raise awareness of the importance of fighting against 
HIV/AIDS. Again this year, the White House will display the red ribbon 
from the North Portico to represent America's commitment to this 
struggle. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to 
AIDS and provide support and comfort to those living with this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8326 of December 5, 2008

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we mourn the more than 2,400 
Americans whose lives were lost in the surprise attack on our homeland 
that changed the course of history. Their service and sacrifice and the 
service and sacrifice of all our World War II veterans will be forever 
honored on this day by the citizens of a free and grateful Nation.
 On December 7, 1941, the enemy nearly destroyed our Pacific Fleet, and 
the United States was forced into a long and terrible war. A generation 
of Americans stepped forward to fight for our country. Their message to 
America's enemies was clear: If you attack this country and harm our 
people, there is no corner of the Earth remote enough to protect you 
from the reach of our Nation's Armed Forces.
 Following the war the United States worked to make our most bitter 
enemies into our closest friends through the transformative power of 
freedom. The joys of liberty are often secured by the sacrifices of 
those who serve a cause greater than self. To honor and recognize the 
sacrifice of our Armed Forces, I have designated nine sites as the World 
War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument. This monument will 
preserve our history and help share this heritage with future 
generations. On this anniversary, we honor the heroes who risked and 
lost their lives for our security and freedom. Their selfless dedication 
exemplifies the great character of America and continues to inspire our 
Nation.
 The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated 
December 7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2008, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn 
occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal 
agencies and interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly 
the flag of the United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of 
those who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8327 of December 5, 2008

Establishment of the World War II Valor In the Pacific National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Beginning at Pearl Harbor with the day of infamy that saw the sinking of 
the USS ARIZONA and ending on the deck of the USS MISSOURI in Tokyo Bay, 
many of the key battles of World War II were waged on and near American 
shores and throughout the Pacific. We must always remember the debt we 
owe to the members of the Greatest Generation for our liberty. Their 
gift is an enduring peace that transformed enemies into steadfast allies 
in the cause of democracy and freedom around the globe.
Americans will never forget the harrowing sacrifices made in the Pacific 
by soldiers and civilians that began at dawn on December 7, 1941, at 
Pearl Harbor on the island of Oahu. The surprise attack killed more than 
2,000 American military personnel and dozens of civilians and thrust the 
United States fully into World War II.
America responded and mobilized our forces to fight side-by-side with 
our allies in the European, Atlantic, and Pacific theaters. The United 
States Navy engaged in epic sea battles, such as Midway, and our Armed 
Forces fought extraordinary land battles for the possession of occupied 
islands. These battles led to significant loss of life for both sides, 
as well as for the island's native peoples. Battlegrounds such as 
Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Guam, Peleliu, the Philippines, Iwo Jima, 
and Okinawa are remembered for the heroic sacrifices and valor displayed 
there.
The conflict raged as far north as the Alaskan territory. The United 
States ultimately won the encounter in the Aleutian Island chain but not 
without protracted and costly battles.
There were also sacrifices on the home front. Tens of millions of 
Americans rallied to support the war effort, often at great personal 
cost. Men and women of all backgrounds were called upon as industrial 
workers, volunteers, and civil servants. Many Americans valiantly 
supported the war effort even as they struggled for their own civil 
rights.
In commemoration of this pivotal period in our Nation's history, the 
World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument adds nine historic 
sites to our national heritage of monuments and memorials representing 
various aspects of the war in the Pacific.
Five of those sites are in the Pearl Harbor area, which is the home of 
both the USS ARIZONA and the USS MISSOURI--milestones of the Pacific 
campaign that mark the beginning and the end of the war. The sites in 
this area include: the USS ARIZONA Memorial and Visitor Center, the USS 
UTAH Memorial, the USS OKLAHOMA Memorial, the six Chief Petty Officer 
Bungalows on Ford Island, and mooring quays F6, F7, and F8, which 
constituted part of Battleship Row. The USS ARIZONA and USS UTAH vessels 
will not be designated as part of the national monument, but instead 
will be retained by the Department of Defense (through the Department of 
the Navy) as the final resting place for those entombed there.

[[Page 132]]

Three sites are located in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. The first is the 
crash site of a Consolidated B-24D Liberator bomber--an aircraft of a 
type that played a highly significant role in World War II--located on 
Atka Island. The second is the site of Imperial Japan's occupation of 
Kiska Island, beginning in June 1942, which marks the northern limit of 
Imperial Japan's expansion in the Pacific. The Kiska site includes 
historic relics such as Imperial Japanese coastal and antiaircraft 
defenses, camps, roads, an airfield, a submarine base, a seaplane base, 
and other installations, as well as the remains of Allied defenses, 
including runway facilities and gun batteries.
The third Aleutian designation is on Attu Island, the site of the only 
land battle fought in North America during World War II. It still 
retains the scars of the battle: thousands of shell and bomb craters in 
the tundra; Japanese trenches, foxholes, and gun encampments; American 
ammunition magazines and dumps; and spent cartridges, shrapnel, and 
shells located at the scenes of heavy fighting. Attu later served as a 
base for bombing missions against Japanese holdings.
The last of the nine designations will bring increased understanding of 
the high price paid by some Americans on the home front. The Tule Lake 
Segregation Center National Historic Landmark and nearby Camp Tule Lake 
in California were both used to house Japanese-Americans relocated from 
the west coast of the United States. They encompass the original 
segregation center's stockade, the War Relocation Authority Motor Pool, 
the Post Engineer's Yard and Motor Pool, a small part of the Military 
Police Compound, several historic structures used by internees and 
prisoners of war at Camp Tule Lake, and the sprawling landscape that 
forms the historic setting.
WHEREAS much of the Federal property within the World War II Valor in 
the Pacific National Monument is easily accessible to visitors from 
around the world;
WHEREAS the Secretary of the Interior should be authorized and directed 
to interpret the broader story of World War II in the Pacific in 
partnership with the Department of Defense, the States of Hawaii, 
Alaska, and California, and other governmental and non-profit 
organizations;
WHEREAS the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument will 
promote understanding of related resources, encourage continuing 
research, present interpretive opportunities and programs for visitors 
to better understand and honor the sacrifices borne by the Greatest 
Generation, and tell the story from Pearl Harbor to Peace;
WHEREAS section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act'') authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by 
the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
WHEREAS it is in the public interest to preserve the areas described 
above and on the attached maps as the World War II Valor in the Pacific 
National Monument;

[[Page 133]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Act of June 
8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), do proclaim that there are hereby 
set apart and reserved as the World War II Valor in the Pacific National 
Monument for the purpose of protecting the objects described above, all 
lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the Government of 
the United States within the boundaries described on the accompanying 
maps, which are attached and form a part of this proclamation. The 
Federal lands and interests in land reserved consist of approximately 
6,310 acres, which is the smallest area compatible with the proper care 
and management of the objects to be protected.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of this 
monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, 
location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the 
public land laws, including, but not limited to, withdrawal from 
location, entry, and patent under mining laws, and from disposition 
under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.
Management of the National Monument 
The Secretary of the Interior shall manage the monument through the 
National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pursuant 
to applicable legal authorities, to implement the purposes of this 
proclamation. The National Park Service shall generally administer the 
national monument, except that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shall 
administer the portions of the national monument that are within a 
national wildlife refuge. The National Park Service and the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service may prepare an agreement to share, consistent with 
applicable laws, whatever resources are necessary to properly manage the 
monument.
For the purposes of preserving, interpreting, and enhancing public 
understanding and appreciation of the national monument and the broader 
story of World War II in the Pacific, the Secretary of the Interior, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall prepare a management 
plan within 3 years of the date of this proclamation.
The Secretary of the Interior shall have management responsibility for

Proclamation 8328 of December 8, 2008

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United States was founded on the principle that government must 
respect people's rights to speak freely, worship as they choose, and 
pursue their dreams in liberty. As we remember the enduring importance 
of our Constitution's Bill of Rights, our thoughts turn to those who 
have yet to secure these precious liberties. During Human Rights Day, 
Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, Americans celebrate the 
rights bestowed upon all by our Creator and reaffirm our deep commitment 
to helping those whose desire for liberty and justice is still dismissed 
and denied.
In a free society, every person is treated with dignity and can rise as 
high as their talents and hard work will take them. Yet in countries 
like Belarus, Burma, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, and 
Zimbabwe, fervent pleas for freedom are silenced by tyranny and 
oppression. So long as there are people who fight for liberty, the 
United States will stand with them and speak out for those who have no 
other voice.
Freedom is the eternal birthright of all mankind, and during Human 
Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we renew our 
commitment to lead the cause of human rights and pray for the day when 
the light of liberty will shine on all of humanity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2008, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 2008, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 2008, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to mark these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8329 of December 16, 2008

Wright Brothers Day, 2008

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our history is rich with pioneers and innovators who used their God-
given talents to improve our Nation and the world. On Wright Brothers 
Day, we commemorate two brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who took 
great risks and ushered in a new era of travel and discovery.

[[Page 144]]

With intrepid spirits and a passion for innovation, Orville and Wilbur 
Wright became the first to experience the thrill of manned, powered 
flight. On December 17, 1903, Orville Wright flew for 12 seconds over 
the North Carolina sand dunes in the presence of only five people. In 
the span of one lifetime, our Nation has seen aviation progress from the 
first tentative takeoff at Kitty Hawk to an age of supersonic flight and 
space exploration.
On this Wright Brothers Day, we recognize all those who have taken great 
risks and contributed to our country's legacy of exploration and 
discovery. This year, we also celebrate the centennial of the world's 
first passenger flight. By remaining dedicated to extending the 
frontiers of knowledge, we can ensure that the United States will 
continue to lead the world in science, innovation, and technology, and 
build a better future for generations to come.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as 
amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of 
each year as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested 
the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of 
the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2008, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.
GEORGE W. BUSH

 4. In Proclamation 8157 of June 28, 2007, I designated the Islamic 
Republic of Mauritania (Mauritania) as an eligible sub-Saharan African 
country and a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country pursuant to 
section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act and

have determined that the Republic of Kosovo (Kosovo) should be 
designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP 
program.
 9. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and having considered the 
factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I have determined that the

Proclamation 8331 of December 23, 2008

To Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America- United States Free 
Trade Agreement With Respect to Costa Rica and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican 
Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the 
``Agreement'') with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the ``Agreement countries''). The 
Agreement was approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the 
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``Act'') (19 U.S.C. 4011).
2. The Parties to the Agreement entered into an amendment of the 
Agreement on July 27, August 6, and August 14, 2007 (the ``Amendment''). 
The Amendment provides for temporary duty-free treatment for certain 
goods of Costa Rica. The terms of the Amendment with respect to Costa 
Rica are contained in letters of understanding described in section 
1634(b)(2) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280, 
120 Stat. 780).
3. Section 201(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(a)(1)) authorizes the 
President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, 
such continuation of duty free or excise treatment, or such additional 
duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to 
carry out or apply Articles 3.3 and 3.27, and Annexes 3.3 (including the 
schedule of United

[[Page 147]]

States duty reductions with respect to originating goods) and 3.27 of 
the Agreement.
4. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(a)(2)), 
each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of 
designated beneficiary developing countries eligible for the benefits of 
the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on the date the Agreement 
enters into force with respect to that country.
5. Consistent with section 201(a)(3) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(a)(3)), 
each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of 
designated beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic 
Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) on the date the Agreement 
enters into force with respect to that country, subject to the 
exceptions set out in section 201(a)(3)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 
4031(a)(3)(B)).
6. Consistent with section 213(b)(5)(D) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 
2703(b)(5)(D)), as amended by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade 
Partnership Act (CBTPA) (Public Law 106-200), each Agreement country is 
to be removed from the enumeration of designated CBTPA beneficiary 
countries on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to 
that country.
7. Section 201(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(b)) authorizes the 
President, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of 
section 104(a) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4014(a)), to proclaim such 
modifications or continuation of any duty, such modifications as the 
United States may agree to with an Agreement country regarding the 
staging of any duty treatment set forth in Annex 3.3 of the Agreement, 
such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional 
duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to 
maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous 
concessions provided for by the Agreement. The consultation and layover 
requirements of section 104(a) of the Act have been satisfied with 
respect to providing temporary duty free treatment for certain goods of 
Costa Rica as set forth in the Amendment.
8. Pursuant to section 201(b) of the Act, I have determined that the 
modifications herein proclaimed of duties on goods of Costa Rica are 
necessary or appropriate to maintain the general level of reciprocal and 
mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Costa Rica provided 
for by the Agreement.
9. In Proclamation 8095 of December 29, 2006, consistent with the 
authority set out in section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act 
(19 U.S.C. 3521(b)), I modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTS) to implement the multilateral agreement negotiated 
under the auspices of the World Trade Organization to eliminate tariffs 
on certain pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediates. I have 
determined that technical corrections to the pharmaceuticals annex to 
the HTS are necessary to ensure that certain products receive the 
intended duty treatment.
10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts 
affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution

[[Page 148]]

and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited 
to section 201 of the Act and section 604 of the 1974 Act, and the Act

being accorded to Costa Rica under the Agreement, as amended, to provide 
certain other treatment to originating goods for the purposes of the

beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, to reflect the 
removal of Costa Rica from the enumeration of designated beneficiary 
countries for purposes of the CBERA and the CBTPA, and to make technical

consistent with section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2483), I have determined that other technical

5. Section 202 of the Implementation Act sets forth certain rules for

Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as 
Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. 
Consistent with section 301 of title 3, United States Code, when 
carrying out functions vested in the President by statute and assigned 
by the President to CITA, the officials collectively exercising those 
functions are all to be officers required to be appointed by the

embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or 
other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, 
including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any 
rate of duty or other import restriction.

the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to

certain originating goods of Oman, to reflect Oman's removal from the

notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I of 
Publication 4050 of the United States International Trade Commission, 
entitled, Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States Implementing the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement 
(Publication 4050), which is incorporated by reference into this 
proclamation.
(2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty elimination provided 
for in the Agreement and to provide for future staged reductions in

on the dates specified in the relevant sections of such publication and 
on any subsequent dates set forth for such duty reductions in that 
publication.

a domestic industry producing an article that is like, or directly 
competitive with, the imported article;

[[Page 151]]

and to provide relief from imports of an article that is the subject of 
such a determination.

Proclamation 8333 of December 30, 2008

National Mentoring Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 During National Mentoring Month, we recognize the millions of 
individuals who dedicate themselves to making a difference in the lives 
of others, and we underscore our commitment to supporting these soldiers 
in America's armies of compassion.
 Every day across our great Nation, men and women of many different 
backgrounds work to inspire our next generation of leaders. By sharing 
their time and experiences, mentors help instill important values that 
encourage America's youth to set high goals and achieve their dreams. 
Mentors demonstrate that the strength of our Nation lies in the hearts 
and souls of our citizens and that a positive influence in someone's 
life helps them secure a more hopeful future.
 My Administration has been committed to building a culture of service, 
citizenship, and responsibility. Through the Mentoring Children of 
Prisoners program, volunteers help provide consistent guidance and 
support so that these children can lead lives of opportunity and 
achievement. The USA Freedom Corps is strengthening mentoring 
opportunities in America and spreading a message of hope across our 
Nation. The Helping America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady Laura 
Bush, motivates caring adults to connect with youth to help them to grow 
up to be responsible and successful adults. By working together, we can 
enrich the lives of our next generation and continue a legacy of 
kindness and encouragement.
 I appreciate our Nation's mentors and all those who contribute to their 
community by helping to change a child's life. For more information on 
volunteering to be a mentor, visit volunteer.gov. During National

Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008

To Extend Duty-Free Treatment for Certain Agricultural Products of 
Israel and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the 
Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel 
(USIFTA), which the Congress approved in the United States-Israel Free 
Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``USIFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2112 note).
2. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, 
on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with 
Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products 
during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the ``2004 
Agreement''). The 2004 Agreement reflects an effort by the United States 
and Israel to address, through 2008, their continuing differences over 
the meaning of certain provisions in the USIFTA governing access for 
U.S. agricultural products to Israel's market.
3. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President 
determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of 
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel 
provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, 
suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such 
continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such 
additional duties as the President determines to be required or 
appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.
4. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 
Agreement, I proclaimed modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
of the United States (HTS) to provide duty-free access into the United 
States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain 
agricultural products of Israel.
5. On December 10, 2008, the United States entered into an agreement 
with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force 
through December 31, 2009, to allow additional time for the two 
governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.

[[Page 153]]

6. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that it 
is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and 
mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by 
the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through 
the close of December 31, 2009, for specified quantities of certain 
agricultural products of Israel.
7. On June 6, 2003, the United States and Chile entered into the United 
States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA). The Congress approved the 
USCFTA in section 101(a) of the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``USCFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3805 note). In 
Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, I proclaimed the tariff 
treatment called for under the USCFTA.
8. Section 201(b) of the USCFTA Act authorizes the President, subject to 
the consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) of the 
USCFTA Act, to proclaim such modifications to the staging of duty 
treatment set forth in Annex 3.3 of the USCFTA as the United States may 
agree to with Chile, as the President determines to be necessary or 
appropriate to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to Chile provided for by the 
USCFTA.
9. On November 26, 2008, the United States entered into an agreement 
with Chile that includes an accelerated schedule of duty elimination 
under the USCFTA for specific originating goods of Chile. The 
consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) of the USCFTA 
Act with respect to the accelerated schedule of duty elimination were 
satisfied as of November 8, 2008.
10. Pursuant to section 201(b) of the USCFTA Act, I have determined that 
modifications hereinafter proclaimed of rates of duties on originating 
goods of Chile are necessary or appropriate to maintain the general 
level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect 
to Chile provided for by the USCFTA and to carry out the agreement with 
Chile on an accelerated schedule of duty elimination for specific 
originating goods of Chile.
11. On May 18, 2004, the United States and Australia entered into the 
United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement (USAFTA). The Congress 
approved the USAFTA in section 101(a) of the United States-Australia 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USAFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
3805 note). In Proclamation 7857 of December 20, 2004, I proclaimed the 
rules of origin called for under the USAFTA.
12. Section 203(o) of the USAFTA Act authorizes the President, subject 
to the consultation and layover requirements of section 104 of the 
USAFTA Act, to proclaim such modifications to the rules of origin as are 
necessary to implement an agreement with Australia pursuant to article 
4.2.5 of the USAFTA.
13. On October 10, 2008, the United States entered into an agreement 
with Australia pursuant to article 4.2.5 of the USAFTA to amend the 
USAFTA rule of origin for certain yarns of viscose rayon fiber. The 
consultation and layover requirements of section 104 of the USAFTA Act 
with respect to the proposed modification of the USAFTA rules of origin 
were satisfied as of December 24, 2008.

[[Page 154]]

14. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting 
import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including section 4 of the 
USIFTA Act, section 201(b) of the USCFTA Act, section 203(o) of the 
USAFTA Act, section 604 of the 1974 Act, and section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to implement U.S. tariff commitments under the 2004 
Agreement through December 31, 2009, the HTS is modified as provided in 
Annex I to this proclamation.
(2)(a) The modifications to the HTS made by Annex I to this proclamation 
shall be effective with respect to goods that are the product of Israel 
and are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after January 1, 2009.

 (b) The provisions of subchapter VIII of chapter 99 of the HTS, as 
modified by Annex I to this proclamation, shall continue in effect through 
December 31, 2009.

(3) In order to provide for an accelerated schedule of duty elimination 
for specific originating goods of Chile, the tariff treatment set forth 
in the HTS is modified as provided in Annex II to this proclamation.
(4) The modifications made to the HTS by Annex II to this proclamation 
shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2009.
(5) In order to implement the agreement with Australia to change the 
USAFTA rules of origin for certain yarns of viscose rayon fiber, the HTS 
is modified as provided in Annex III to this proclamation.
(6) The modifications made to the HTS by Annex III to this proclamation 
shall enter into effect on the date that the United States Trade 
Representative announces in a notice published in the Federal Register 
that Australia has completed its applicable domestic procedures to give 
effect to the agreement to change the USAFTA rules of origin for certain 
yarns of viscose rayon fiber and shall be effective with respect to 
originating goods of Australia entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after the date indicated in the notice.
(7) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.
GEORGE W. BUSH

this order, and no authority under the Act shall be available for the 
enforcement of such actions or authorities.

(f) The Committee may initiate a review of a transaction that has 
previously been reviewed by the Committee only in the extraordinary 
circumstances provided in the Act.

Sec. 8. Additional Assignments to the Committee. In addition to the

Executive Order 13457 of January 29, 2008

Protecting American Taxpayers From Government Spending on Wasteful 
Earmarks

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government to be 
judicious in the expenditure of taxpayer dollars. To ensure the proper 
use of taxpayer funds that are appropriated for Government programs and 
purposes, it is necessary that the number and cost of earmarks be 
reduced, that their origin and purposes be transparent, and that they be 
included in the text of the bills voted upon by the Congress and 
presented to the President. For appropriations laws and other 
legislation enacted after the date of this

[[Page 176]]

order, executive agencies should not commit, obligate, or expend funds 
on the basis of earmarks included in any non-statutory source, including 
requests in reports of committees of the Congress or other congressional 
documents, or communications from or on behalf of Members of Congress, 
or any other non-statutory source, except when required by law or when 
an agency has itself determined a project, program, activity, grant, or 
other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or other merit-
based decisionmaking.
Sec. 2. Duties of Agency Heads. (a) With respect to all appropriations 
laws and other legislation enacted after the date of this order, the 
head of each agency shall take all necessary steps to ensure that:

(i) agency decisions to commit, obligate, or expend funds for any earmark 
are based on the text of laws, and in particular, are not based on language 
in any report of a committee of Congress, joint explanatory statement of a 
committee of conference of the Congress, statement of managers concerning a 
bill in the Congress, or any other non-statutory statement or indication of 
views of the Congress, or a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff 
thereof;

(ii) agency decisions to commit, obligate, or expend funds for any earmark 
are based on authorized, transparent, statutory criteria and merit-based 
decision making, in the manner set forth in section II of OMB Memorandum M-
07-10, dated February 15, 2007, to the extent consistent with applicable 
law; and

(iii) no oral or written communications concerning earmarks shall supersede 
statutory criteria, competitive awards, or merit-based decisionmaking.

(b) An agency shall not consider the views of a House, committee, 
Member, officer, or staff of the Congress with respect to commitments, 
obligations, or expenditures to carry out any earmark unless such views 
are in writing, to facilitate consideration in accordance with section 
2(a)(ii) above. All written communications from the Congress, or a 
House, committee, Member, officer, or staff thereof, recommending that 
funds be committed, obligated, or expended on any earmark shall be made 
publicly available on the Internet by the receiving agency, not later 
than 30 days after receipt of such communication, unless otherwise 
specifically directed by the head of the agency, without delegation, 
after consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget, to preserve appropriate confidentiality between the executive 
and legislative branches.
(c) Heads of agencies shall otherwise implement within their respective 
agencies the policy set forth in section 1 of this order, consistent 
with such instructions as the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget may prescribe.
(d) The head of each agency shall upon request provide to the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget information about earmarks and 
compliance with this order.
Sec. 3. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
(a) The term ``agency'' means an executive agency as defined in section 
105 of title 5, United States Code, and the United States Postal Service 
and the Postal Regulatory Commission, but shall exclude the Government 
Accountability Office; and

[[Page 177]]

(b) the term ``earmark'' means funds provided by the Congress for 
projects, programs, or grants where the purported congressional 
direction (whether in statutory text, report language, or other 
communication) circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or 
competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or 
recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the executive branch to 
manage its statutory and constitutional responsibilities pertaining to 
the funds allocation process.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) authority granted by law to an agency or the head thereof; or

(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with 
applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by 
any party against the United States, its agencies, instrumentalities, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008

Blocking Property of Additional Persons in Connection With the National 
Emergency With Respect to Syria

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that 
the Government of Syria continues to engage in certain conduct that 
formed the basis for the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13338 of May 11, 2004, including but not limited to undermining efforts 
with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. I further find that the 
conduct of certain members of the Government of Syria and other persons 
contributing to public corruption related to Syria, including by 
misusing Syrian public assets or by misusing public authority, 
entrenches and enriches the Government of Syria and its supporters and 
thereby enables the Government of Syria to continue to engage in certain 
conduct that formed the basis for the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13338. In light of these findings, and to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004, I hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), 
and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3) and (4)), the Trade 
Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (title IX, Public 
Law 106-387), or regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may 
be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date of this order, all property and interests in property that are in 
the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that 
are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United 
States person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons 
are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in: persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, 
after consultation with the Secretary of State, to be responsible for, 
to have engaged in, to have facilitated, or to have secured improper 
advantage as a result of, public corruption by senior officials within 
the Government of Syria.
(b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but are 
not limited to, (i) the making of any contribution or provision of 
funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person 
designated pursuant to this order, and (ii) the receipt of any 
contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such 
person.
Sec. 2. Section 3(a)(iv) of Executive Order 13338 is hereby amended to 
read as follows:

``(iv) to be or to have been responsible for or otherwise significantly 
contributing to actions taken or decisions made by the Government of Syria 
that have the purpose or effect of undermining efforts to stabilize Iraq or 
of allowing the use of Syrian territory or facilities to undermine efforts 
to stabilize Iraq; or''.

[[Page 182]]

Sec. 3. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 4. For purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``person'' means any individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and
(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type 
specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, 
or for the benefit of, persons whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair 
my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13338 and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive 
Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, and I hereby prohibit such donations as 
provided by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 6. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who might have a 
constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, because of 
the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior 
notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order 
would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for 
these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 13338 and relied upon for additional steps 
taken in Executive Order 13399, there need be no prior notice of a 
determination made pursuant to this order.
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government, consistent with applicable law. All executive agencies of 
the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this 
order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in 
a timely manner of the measures taken.
Sec. 8. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued 
effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other 
forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect 
heretofore or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly 
terminated, modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order.
Sec. 9. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party

[[Page 183]]

against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, 
or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

and Democracy Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-61, as amended, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
note), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to 
take additional steps with respect to the Government of Burma's

13310 of July 28, 2003, and expanded in Executive Order 13448 of October 
18, 2007,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby 
order:
Section 1. Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), and 
(4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), the Trade Sanctions 
Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (title IX, Public Law 106-
387), or regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued 
pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or 
any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, 
all property and interests in property of the following persons that are 
in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or 
that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United 
States persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked and may 
not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
(a) the persons listed in the Annex attached and made a part of this 
order; and
(b) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State:
(i) to be owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly, the Government 
of Burma or an official or officials of the Government of Burma;

[[Page 190]]

(ii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in 
support of, the Government of Burma, the State Peace and Development 
Council of Burma, the Union Solidarity and Development Association of 
Burma, any successor entity to any of the foregoing, any senior official 
of any of the foregoing, or any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310, Executive Order 
13448, or this order; or
(iii) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13310, 
Executive Order 13448, or this order.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States; and
(d) the term ``Government of Burma'' means the Government of Burma 
(sometimes referred to as Myanmar), its agencies, instrumentalities and 
controlled entities, and the Central Bank of Burma.
Sec. 4. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type 
specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) by, to, 
or for the benefit of, persons whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously impair 
my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13047, relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 
13310, and expanded in Executive Order 13448, and hereby prohibit such 
donations as provided by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13047, relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 
13310, and expanded in Executive Order 13448, there need be no prior 
notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this 
order.

Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and section 4 of the Burmese Freedom 
and Democracy Act of 2003 as may be necessary to carry out the purposes 
of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these 
functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government 
consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States 
Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within 
their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine, and to take 
necessary action to give effect to that determination, that 
circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the property and 
interests in property of, or the prohibiting of transactions with, a 
person listed in the Annex to this order.
Sec. 8. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the continued 
effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, licenses, or other 
forms of administrative action issued, taken, or continued in effect 
heretofore or hereafter under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly 
terminated, modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order.
Sec. 9. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, 
instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other 
person.
Sec. 10. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
May 1, 2008.

Executive Order 13465 of June 6, 2008

Amending Executive Order 12989, as Amended

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including subsection 121(a) of 
title 40 and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in order to 
take further steps to promote economy and efficiency in Federal 
Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Executive Order 12989 of February 13, 1996, as amended, is 
further amended:
(a) by striking the title and inserting in lieu thereof ``Economy and 
Efficiency in Government Procurement Through Compliance with Certain 
Immigration and Nationality Act Provisions and Use of an Electronic 
Employment Eligibility Verification System''; and
(b) by striking the material that follows the title and precedes section 
1 of the order and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
``This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Federal 
Government procurement. Stability and dependability are important 
elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose workforce is less 
stable will be less likely to produce goods and services economically 
and efficiently than a contractor whose workforce is more stable. It is 
the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the immigration laws 
of the United States, including the detection and removal of illegal 
aliens and the imposition of legal sanctions against employers that hire 
illegal aliens. Because of the worksite enforcement policy of the United 
States and the underlying obligation of the executive branch to enforce 
the immigration laws, contractors that employ illegal aliens cannot rely 
on the continuing availability and service of those illegal workers, and 
such contractors inevitably will have a less stable and less dependable 
workforce than contractors that do not employ such persons. Where a 
contractor assigns illegal aliens to work on Federal contracts, the 
enforcement of Federal immigration laws imposes a direct risk of 
disruption, delay, and increased expense in Federal contracting. Such 
contractors are less dependable procurement sources, even if they do not 
knowingly hire or knowingly continue to employ unauthorized workers.
``Contractors that adopt rigorous employment eligibility confirmation 
policies are much less likely to face immigration enforcement actions, 
because they are less likely to employ unauthorized workers, and they 
are therefore generally more efficient and dependable procurement 
sources than contractors that do not employ the best available measures 
to verify the work eligibility of their workforce. It is the policy of 
the executive branch to use an electronic employment verification system 
because, among other reasons, it provides the best available means to 
confirm the identity and work eligibility of all employees that join the 
Federal workforce. Private employers that choose to contract with the 
Federal Government should meet the same standard.
``I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of contracting 
only with providers that do not knowingly employ unauthorized alien 
workers

[[Page 193]]

and that have agreed to utilize an electronic employment verification 
system designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security to confirm the 
employment eligibility of their workforce will promote economy and 
efficiency in Federal procurement.
``NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration 
and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority 
vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United 
States of America, including subsection 121(a) of title 40 and section 
301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:''.
Sec. 2. Section 1 of Executive Order 12989, as amended, is further 
amended by:
(a) striking the last sentence in subsection 1(a); and
(b) striking subsection (b) and inserting in lieu thereof the following 
new subsections:

``(b) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and 
services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and 
completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies may not 
enter into contracts with employers that do not use the best available 
means to confirm the work authorization of their workforce.

``(c) It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the 
antidiscrimination provisions of the INA. Nothing in this order relieves 
employers of antidiscrimination obligations under section 274B of the INA 
(8 U.S.C. 1324b) or any other law.

``(d) All discretion under this order shall be exercised consistent with 
the policies set forth in this section.''.

Sec. 3. Section 5 of Executive Order 12989, as amended, is further 
amended to read as follows:

``Sec. 5. (a) Executive departments and agencies that enter into contracts 
shall require, as a condition of each contract, that the contractor agree 
to use an electronic employment eligibility verification system designated 
by the Secretary of Homeland Security to verify the employment eligibility 
of: (i) all persons hired during the contract term by the contractor to 
perform employment duties within the United States; and (ii) all persons 
assigned by the contractor to perform work within the United States on the 
Federal contract.

``(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security:

    ``(i) shall administer, maintain, and modify as necessary and 
appropriate the electronic employment eligibility verification 
system designated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this 
section; and
    ``(ii) may establish with respect to such electronic 
employment verification system:
``(A) terms and conditions for use of the system; and
``(B) procedures for monitoring the use, failure to use, or 
improper use of the system.

``(c) The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and 
the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to the extent necessary

[[Page 194]]

and appropriate to implement the debarment responsibility, the employment 
eligibility verification responsibility, and other related responsibilities 
assigned to heads of departments and agencies under this order.

``(d) Except to the extent otherwise specified by law or this order, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General:

    ``(i) shall administer and enforce this order; and
    ``(ii) may, after consultation to the extent appropriate with 
the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the 
Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator 
for Federal Procurement Policy, and the heads of such other 
departments or agencies as may be appropriate, issue such rules, 
regulations, or orders, or establish such requirements, as may be 
necessary and appropriate to implement this order.''.
Sec. 4. Section 7 of Executive Order 12989, as amended, is amended by 
striking ``respective agencies'' and inserting in lieu thereof 
``respective departments or agencies''.
Sec. 5. Section 8 of Executive Order 12989, as amended, is amended to 
read as follows:

``Sec. 8. (a) This order shall be implemented in a manner intended to 
minimize the burden on participants in the Federal procurement process.

``(b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with the 
protection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, and 
activities from unauthorized disclosure.''.

Sec. 6. Section 9 of Executive Order 12989, as amended, is amended to 
read as follows:

``Sec. 9. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:

    (i) authority granted by law to a department or agency or the 
head thereof; or
    (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative 
proposals.

``(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations.

``(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any 
party against the United States, its departments, agencies or entities, its 
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.''.

Sec. 7. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that 
the current existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable 
fissile material on the Korean Peninsula constitute an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with 
that threat. I further find that, as we deal with that threat through 
multilateral diplomacy, it is necessary to continue certain restrictions 
with respect to North Korea that would otherwise be lifted pursuant to a 
forthcoming proclamation that will terminate the exercise of authorities 
under the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq.) (TWEA)

national that, pursuant to the President's authorities under the TWEA, the 
exercise of which has been continued in accordance with section 101(b) of 
Public Law 95-223 (91 Stat. 1625; 50 U.S.C. App. 5(b) note), were blocked 
as of June 16, 2000, and remained blocked immediately prior to the date of 
this order.

Sec. 2. Except to the extent provided in statutes or in regulations, 
orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this 
order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or

may not register a vessel in North Korea, obtain authorization for a 
vessel to fly the North Korean flag, or own, lease, operate, or insure 
any vessel flagged by North Korea.
Sec. 3. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 4. For the purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and

[[Page 196]]

(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers

purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 7. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by

Executive Order 13467 of June 30, 2008

Reforming Processes Related to Suitability for Government Employment, 
Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to 
Classified National Security Information

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure an 
efficient, practical, reciprocal, and aligned system for investigating 
and determining suitability for Government employment, contractor 
employee fitness, and eligibility for access to classified information, 
while taking appropriate account of title III of Public Law 108-458, it 
is hereby ordered as follows:
PART 1--POLICY, APPLICABILITY, AND DEFINITIONS
Section 1.1. Policy. Executive branch policies and procedures relating 
to suitability, contractor employee fitness, eligibility to hold a 
sensitive position, access to federally controlled facilities and 
information systems, and eligibility for access to classified 
information shall be aligned using consistent standards to the extent 
possible, provide for reciprocal recognition,

[[Page 197]]

and shall ensure cost-effective, timely,and efficient protection of the 
national interest, while providing fair treatment to those upon whom the 
Federal Government relies to conduct our Nation's business and protect 
national security.
Sec. 1.2. Applicability. (a) This order applies to all covered 
individuals as defined in section 1.3(g), except that:

(i) the provisions regarding eligibility for physical access to federally 
controlled facilities and logical access to federally controlled 
information systems do not apply to individuals exempted in accordance with 
guidance pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act (title 
III of Public Law 107-347) and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12; 
and

(ii) the qualification standards for enlistment, appointment, and induction 
into the Armed Forces pursuant to title 10, United States Code, are 
unaffected by this order.

(b) This order also applies to investigations and determinations of 
eligibility for access to classified information for employees of 
agencies working in or for the legislative or judicial branches when 
those investigations or determinations are conducted by the executive 
branch.
Sec. 1.3. Definitions. For the purpose of this order: (a) 
``Adjudication'' means the evaluation of pertinent data in a background 
investigation, as well as any other available information that is 
relevant and reliable, to determine whether a covered individual is:

(i) suitable for Government employment;

(ii) eligible for logical and physical access;

(iii) eligible for access to classified information;

Executive Order 13469 of July 25, 2008

Blocking Property of Additional Persons Undermining Democratic Processes 
or Institutions in Zimbabwe

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that 
the continued actions and policies of the Government of Zimbabwe and 
other persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or 
institutions, manifested most recently in the fundamentally undemocratic 
election held on June 27, 2008, to commit acts of violence and other 
human rights abuses against political opponents, and to engage in public 
corruption, including by misusing public authority, constitute an 
unusual and extraor- dinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, and to deal with that threat, hereby expand the scope of the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, 
and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13391 of 
November 22, 2005, and hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided by statutes, or provided in 
regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant 
to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any 
license or permit granted prior to the date of this order, all property 
and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of United States persons, including their overseas 
branches, of the following persons are blocked and may not be 
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
Any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

(i) to be a senior official of the Government of Zimbabwe;

 (ii) to be owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly, the Government 
of Zimbabwe or an official or officials of the Government of Zimbabwe;

(iii) to have engaged in actions or policies to undermine Zimbabwe's 
democratic processes or institutions;

(iv) to be responsible for, or to have participated in, human rights abuses 
related to political repression in Zimbabwe;

(v) to be engaged in, or to have engaged in, activities facilitating public 
corruption by senior officials of the Government of Zimbabwe;

(vi) to be a spouse or dependent child of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13288, 
Executive Order 13391, or this order;

(vii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in 
support

[[Page 217]]

of, the Government of Zimbabwe, any senior official thereof, or any person 
whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive 
Order 13288, Executive Order 13391, or this order; or (viii) to be owned or 
controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, 
directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13288, Executive Order 13391, or 
this order.

(b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section would 
seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13288, as amended, and I hereby prohibit such 
donations as provided by paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The prohibitions of this section include but are not limited to (i) 
the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13288, Executive Order 
13391, or this order, and (ii) the receipt of any contribution or 
provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.
(d) The provisions of Executive Orders 13288 and 13391 remain in effect, 
and this order does not affect any action taken pursuant to those 
orders.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b)Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States; and
(d) the term ``Government of Zimbabwe'' means the Government of 
Zimbabwe, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities.
Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that, for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13288, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination 
made pursuant to section 1 of this order.

[[Page 218]]

Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13288, as amended, and 5 expanded in this order, 
consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703).
Sec. 7. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, 
instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other 
person.

PART 1 Goals, Directions, Duties, and Responsibilities with Respect to 
United States Intelligence Efforts

[[Page 219]]

President, the National Security Council, and the Homeland Security 
Council with the necessary information on which to base decisions 
concerning the development and conduct of foreign, defense, and economic 
policies, and the protection of United States national interests from 
foreign security threats. All departments and agencies shall cooperate 
fully to fulfill this goal.
(a) All means, consistent with applicable Federal law and this order, 
and with full consideration of the rights of United States persons, 
shall be used to obtain reliable intelligence information to protect the 
United States and its interests.

continue in the conduct of intelligence activities under this order, to 
protect fully the legal rights of all United States persons, including 
freedoms, civil liberties, and privacy rights guaranteed by Federal law.

need for information to respond to intelligence priorities set by the

executive branch, that draw on all appropriate sources of information, 
including open source information, meet rigorous analytic standards, 
consider diverse analytic viewpoints, and accurately represent 
appropriate alternative views.
(f) State, local, and tribal governments are critical partners in 
securing and defending the United States from terrorism and other 
threats to the United States and its interests. Our national

appropriate, private sector entities, when undertaking the collection 
and dissemination of information and intelligence to protect the United 
States.

actions. The NSC shall also review proposals for other sensitive 
intelligence operations.

direction, and control of the President, the Director of National 
Intelligence (Director) shall serve as the head of the Intelligence

containing an element of the Intelligence Community and of the Director 
of the Central Intelligence Agency.
(a) Except as otherwise directed by the President or prohibited by law, 
the Director shall have access to all information and intelligence 
described in section 1.5(a) of this order. For the purpose of access to

Notice of January 18, 2008

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four 
additional persons, including Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt 
the Middle East peace process.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, as expanded on August 
20, 1998, and the measures adopted on those dates to deal with that 
emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2008. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process.

Presidential Determination No. 2008-8 of January 22, 2008

Determination on the Proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the 
United States of America and the Republic of Turkey Concerning Peaceful 
Uses of Nuclear Energy

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Energy
I have considered the proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the 
United States of America and the Republic of Turkey Concerning Peaceful 
Uses of Nuclear Energy, signed at Ankara on July 26, 2000, along with 
the views, recommendations, and statements of interested agencies.
I approve the proposed Agreement and have determined the performance of 
the Agreement will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable risk 
to, the common defense and security.
The Secretary of State is authorized to publish this determination in 
the Federal Register.
GEORGE W. BUSH

    Washington, January 22, 2008.

Presidential Determination No. 2008-9 of January 28, 2008

Waiver of Section 1083 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2008

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, including section 301 of title 3, United 
States Code, and section 1083(d) of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (the ``Act''), I hereby determine that:

<bullet> All provisions of section 1083 of the Act, if applied to Iraq or 
any agency or instrumentality thereof, may affect Iraq or its agencies or 
instrumentalities, by exposing Iraq or its agencies or instrumentalities to 
liability in United States courts and by entangling their assets in 
litigation.

<bullet> The economic security and successful reconstruction of Iraq 
continue to be top national security priorities of the United States. 
Section 1083 of the Act threatens those key priorities. If permitted to 
apply to Iraq, section 1083 would risk the entanglement of substantial 
Iraqi assets in

[[Page 269]]

litigation in the United States--including those of the Development Fund 
for Iraq, the Central Bank of Iraq, and commercial entities in the United 
States in which Iraq has an interest. Section 1083 also would expose Iraq 
to new liability of at least several billion dollars by undoing judgments 
favorable to Iraq, by foreclosing available defenses on which Iraq is 
relying in pending litigation, and by creating a new Federal cause of 
action backed by the prospect of punitive damages to support claims that 
may previously have been foreclosed. If permitted to apply to Iraq, section 
1083 would have a significant financial impact on Iraq and would result in 
the redirection of financial resources from the continued reconstruction of 
Iraq and the harming of Iraq's stability, contrary to the interests of the 
United States.

<bullet> A waiver of all provisions of section 1083 with respect to Iraq 
and any agency or instrumentality of Iraq is therefore in the national 
security interest of the United States and will promote the reconstruction 
of, the consolidation of democracy in, and the relations of the United 
States with, Iraq.

<bullet> Iraq continues to be a reliable ally of the United States and a 
partner in combating acts of international terrorism. The November 26, 
2007, Declaration of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation 
and Friendship between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of 
America confirmed the commitment of the United States and Iraq to build an 
enduring relationship in the political, diplomatic, economic, and security 
arenas and to work together to combat all terrorist groups, including al-
Qaida.

Accordingly, I hereby waive all provisions of section 1083 of the Act 
with respect to Iraq and any agency or instrumentality thereof.
You are authorized and directed to notify the Congress of this 
determination and waiver and the accompanying memorandum of 
justification, incorporated by reference herein, and to arrange for 
their publication in the Federal Register.

Unexpected Urgent Refugee and Migration Needs Related to Africa and the

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States, including sections 2 and 4(a)(1) of the Migration and 
Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 (the ``Act''), as amended (22 U.S.C. 2601

(1) I hereby determine, pursuant to 2(c)(1) of the Act, that it is 
important to the national interest to furnish assistance under the Act 
in an amount not to exceed $32 million from the United States Emergency 
Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund for the purpose of meeting 
unexpected and urgent refugee and migration needs, including by 
contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental 
organizations and payment of administrative expenses of the Bureau of 
Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State, related 
to humanitarian needs in Africa and in the West Bank and Gaza; and
(2) the functions of the President in relation to this memorandum under 
2(d) of the Act, and of establishing terms and conditions under section 
2(c)(1) of the Act, are assigned to you.

Notice of February 5, 2008

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Certain 
Persons Contributing to the Conflict in Cote d'Ivoire

On February 7, 2006, by Executive Order 13396, I declared a national 
emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain 
persons contributing to the conflict in Cote d'Ivoire, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I 
took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the situation in or in relation to Cote d'Ivoire, which 
has been addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 
1572 of November 15, 2004, and subsequent resolutions, and has resulted 
in the massacre of large numbers of civilians, widespread human rights 
abuses, significant political violence and unrest, and attacks against 
international peacekeeping forces leading to fatalities. Because the 
situation in or in relation to Cote d'Ivoire continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and

[[Page 274]]

foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
February 7, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond February 7, 2008. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13396.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Notice of February 6, 2008

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on subsequent 
occasions, the Cuban government stated its intent to forcefully defend 
its sovereignty against any U.S.- registered vessels or aircraft that 
might enter Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a 
flotilla or peaceful protest. Since these events, the Cuban government 
has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the future use of 
reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may 
engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. On 
February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757, the scope of the national 
emergency was expanded in order to deny monetary and material support to 
the repressive Cuban government, which had taken a series of steps to 
destabilize relations with the United States, including threatening to 
abrogate the Migration Accords with the United States and to close the 
United States Interests Section. Further, Cuba's most senior officials 
repeatedly asserted that the United States intended to invade Cuba, 
despite explicit denials from the U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense 
that such action is planned. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency 
authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of 
vessels set out in Proclamation 6867 as amended and expanded by 
Proclamation 7757.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, I declared a national 
emergency and blocked the property of persons undermining democratic 
processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action 
to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy 
of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. These actions have 
contributed to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, 
politically motivated violence and intimidation, and political and 
economic instability in the southern African region. On November 22, 
2005, I issued Executive Order 13391 to take additional steps with 
respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 by 
ordering the blocking of the property of additional persons undermining 
democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date and on November 22, 2005, to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2008. Therefore, 
in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50

respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government

Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2008. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50

[[Page 279]]

U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 
constitutes an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 
1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is distinct from the 
emergency renewal of November 2007. This notice shall be published in

Presidential Determination No. 2008-17 of March 28, 2008

Determinations Under Section 1106(a) of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988--Ukraine

Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Pursuant to section 1106(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act 
of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2905(a)) (the ``Act''), I determine that state 
trading enterprises account for a significant share of Ukraine's exports 
and goods that compete with imports into Ukraine. I further determine 
that such state trading enterprises unduly burden and restrict, or 
adversely affect, the foreign trade of the United States or the United 
States economy, or are likely to result in such burden, restriction, or 
effect.
Ukraine is seeking to become a member of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). The terms and conditions for Ukraine's accession to the WTO 
include Ukraine's commitments that it will ensure that all state trading 
enterprises will make purchases of goods and services that are not 
intended for governmental use, and sales in international trade in 
accordance with commercial considerations (including price, quality, 
availability, marketability, and transportation) and that U.S. firms 
will have an adequate opportunity, in conformity with customary 
practice, to compete for such purchases or sales.
The obligations that Ukraine will assume under the WTO Agreement, 
including Ukraine's protocol of accession, meet the requirements of 
section 1106(b)(2)(A) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2905(b)(2)(A)), and thus my 
determinations under section 1106(a) do not require invocation of the 
nonapplication provisions of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the 
WTO with regard to Ukraine.
You are directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.

Notice of May 7, 2008

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Certain 
Persons and Prohibiting the Export of Certain Goods to Syria

On May 11, 2004, pursuant to my authority under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and the Syria 
Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Public 
Law 108-175), I issued Executive Order 13338, in which I declared a 
national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of 
Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive Order 13338 
authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and prohibited 
the exportation or re-exportation of certain goods to Syria. On April 
25, 2006, and February 13, 2008, I issued Executive Order 13399 and 
Executive Order 13460, respectively, to take additional steps with 
respect to this national emergency.
I took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in 
supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-existing occupation of 
Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs 
including the recent revelation of illicit nuclear cooperation with 
North Korea, and undermining U.S. and international efforts with respect 
to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Syria continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared

on May 11, 2004, and the measures adopted on that date and on April 25,

Order 13460, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond 
May 11, 2008. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year

persons and prohibiting the exportation or re-exportation of certain

Notice of May 16, 2008

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma

On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, certifying 
to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-208), that the Government of Burma has engaged in large-scale 
repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 
1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
United States persons contained in that section. The President also 
declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions 
and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter 
alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.
On July 28, 2003, I issued Executive Order 13310 taking additional steps 
with respect to that national emergency by putting in place an import 
ban required by the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and 
prohibiting exports of financial services to Burma and the dealing in 
property in which certain designated Burmese persons have an interest. 
On October 18, 2007, I issued Executive Order 13448 to expand 
prohibitions to include the Burmese regime's financial supporters and 
their companies, as well as individuals determined to be responsible for 
or to have participated in human rights abuses or to have engaged in 
activities facilitating public corruption. On April 30, 2008, I issued 
Executive Order 13464 taking additional steps with respect to the 
Government of Burma's continued repression of the democratic opposition 
in Burma.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
May 20, 1997, and expanded on October 18, 2007, and April 30, 2008, and 
the measures adopted to deal with that emergency, must continue in 
effect beyond May 20, 2008. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) 
of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for

On May 22, 2003, by Executive Order 13303, I declared a national 
emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other 
property in which Iraq has an interest, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (IEEPA). I took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States posed by obstacles to 
the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of 
peace and security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq.
In Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 of 
July 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, and Executive 
Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, I modified the scope of the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and amended the steps taken 
pursuant to it.
Because the obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national

date, August 28, 2003, July 29, 2004, November 29, 2004, and July 17, 
2007, to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond May 22, 
2008. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions and

emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain 
persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Belarus, 
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain members 
of the Government of Belarus and other persons that have undermined 
democratic processes or institutions; committed human rights abuses 
related to political repression, including detentions and 
disappearances; and engaged in public corruption, including by diverting 
or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority.
Because these actions and policies continue to pose an unusual and

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Usable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``order'') blocking property and interests in property of the Government 
of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of United States persons that are directly related 
to the implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation 
Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from 
Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related contracts and 
agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU Agreements 
allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived from 
nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial 
purposes. The order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of 
the Russian Federation.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2008, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202 (d) of the National Emergencies Act (50

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Former 
Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor

On July 22, 2004, by Executive Order 13348, I declared a national 
emergency and ordered related measures, including the blocking of the 
property of certain persons connected to the former Liberian regime of 
Charles Taylor, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of former Liberian President 
Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular their unlawful depletion 
of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of 
Liberian funds and property, which have undermined Liberia's transition 
to democracy and the orderly development of its political, 
administrative, and economic institutions and resources. I further noted 
that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on August 18, 2003, and 
the related cease-fire had not yet been universally implemented 
throughout Liberia, and that the illicit trade in round logs and timber 
products was linked to the proliferation of and trafficking in illegal 
arms, which perpetuated the Liberian conflict and fueled and exacerbated 
other conflicts throughout West Africa.
The actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others have left a legacy 
of destruction that continues to undermine Liberia's transformation and 
recovery. Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided to me under 
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et 
seq.), I issued Executive Order 13222. In that order, I declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States in light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 
1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). Because the Export 
Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national 
emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond 
August 17, 2008. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect To the Actions of 
Certain Persons To Undermine the Sovereignty of Lebanon Or Its 
Democratic Processes And Institutions

On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, I declared a national 
emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain 
persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic 
processes or institutions and certain other persons, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I 
took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions of certain persons to undermine Lebanon's 
legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic 
institutions, to contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of 
law in Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and 
intimidation, to reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian 
interference in Lebanon, or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese 
sovereignty which contributes to political and economic instability in 
that country and the region.
Because these actions continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, 
the national emergency declared on August 1, 2007, and the measures 
adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in 
effect beyond August 1, 2008. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order

Continuation of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of 
Colombia

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Colombia, that (1) 
interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in 
illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary because 
of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the 
national security of that country; and (2) that country has appropriate 
procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life in the air 
and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which shall at a 
minimum include effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before 
the use of force is directed against the aircraft.

Proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United 
States of America and the Government of India Concerning Peaceful Uses 
of Nuclear Energy

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Energy
I have considered the Proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of India

[[Page 295]]

Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, along with the views, 
recommendations, and statements of interested agencies.
I have determined that the performance of the Agreement will promote, 
and will not constitute an unreasonable risk to, the common defense and 
security. Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(B)), I hereby approve the proposed agreement 
and authorize the Secretary of State to arrange for its execution.
In addition, pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution 
and the laws of the United States of America, including the Henry J. 
Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006 
(Public Law 109-401), I hereby determine that:
1. India has provided the United States and the IAEA with a credible 
plan to separate civil and military nuclear facilities, materials, and 
programs, and has filed a declaration regarding its civil facilities and 
materials with the IAEA;
2. India and the IAEA have concluded all legal steps required prior to 
signature by the parties of an agreement requiring the application of 
IAEA safeguards in perpetuity in accordance with IAEA standards, 
principles, and practices (including IAEA Board of Governors Document 
GOV/1621 (1973)) to India's civil nuclear facilities, materials, and 
programs as declared in the plan described in paragraph (1), including 
materials used in or produced through the use of India's civil nuclear 
facilities;
3. India and the IAEA are making substantial progress toward concluding 
an Additional Protocol consistent with IAEA principles, practices, and 
policies that would apply to India's civil nuclear program;
4. India is working actively with the United States for the early 
conclusion of a multilateral treaty on the cessation of the production 
of fissile materials for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear 
explosive devices;
5. India is working with and supporting United States and international 
efforts to prevent the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology 
to any state that does not already possess full-scale, functioning 
enrichment or reprocessing plants;
6. India is taking the necessary steps to secure nuclear and other 
sensitive materials and technology, including through (A) the enactment 
and effective enforcement of comprehensive export control legislation 
and regulations; (B) harmonization of its export control laws, 
regulations, policies, and practices with the guidelines and practices 
of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Nuclear 
Suppliers Group (NSG); and (C) adherence to the MTCR and the NSG in 
accordance with the procedures of those regimes for unilateral 
adherence; and
7. The NSG has decided by consensus to permit supply to India of nuclear 
items covered by the guidelines of the NSG.
I therefore hereby (1) exempt the proposed Agreement for Cooperation 
Between the Government of the United States of America and the 
Government of India Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy arranged 
pursuant to section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 
2153) from the requirement of subsection 123 a.(2) of such section; (2) 
waive the application of section 128 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 
(42 U.S.C. 2157) with

[[Page 296]]

respect to exports to India; and (3) waive with respect to India the 
application of:
(A) subsection 129 a.(1)(D) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 
2158(a)(1)(D)); and
(B) section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2158)

Presidential Determination No. 2008-28 of September 15, 2008

Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal 
Year 2009

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the 
following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug 
producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, 
Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, 
Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.
A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse 
reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of 
cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory 
definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth 
in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit 
drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of 
geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit 
or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous 
enforcement measures.
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, 
Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during 
the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under 
international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set 
forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report are 
justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, 
as required by section 706(2)(B). I have also determined, in accordance 
with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for 
programs to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions and continued 
support for bilateral programs in Bolivia are vital to the national 
interests of the United States.
Under the leadership of President Karzai, the Government of Afghanistan 
has made some progress in combating narcotics. However, drug trafficking 
remains a serious threat to the future of Afghanistan, contributing to 
widespread public corruption, damaging legitimate economic growth, and 
fueling violence and insurgency.
A successful counternarcotics strategy in Afghanistan hinges on 
maintaining security, building public capacity, attaining local support, 
and actively pursuing our joint counternarcotics strategy.
Poppy cultivation continues to be marked by the divide between the 
increasingly poppy-free northern provinces and the insurgency-dominated 
regions in the south. Through political will, and by using a mixture of 
incentives and disincentives, governors in key northern provinces like 
Badakshan and Nangarhar have significantly reduced poppy cultivation.
Inspired by the Nangarhar model, the newly appointed governor of the 
southern province of Helmand has taken bold steps to implement the first 
truly serious counternarcotics campaign in the province. It is clear 
that progress in Helmand Province will not come easily. Drug control 
efforts in

[[Page 298]]

this area of pronounced poppy cultivation are thwarted by heavily 
entrenched Taliban centers of power. In 2007 Helmand Province cultivated 
more than half of Afghanistan's illegal poppy crop.
Difficult security conditions greatly impede counternarcotics 
operations, particularly in the south and southwest provinces, areas in 
which the insurgency and organized crime groups predominate and where 
over 85 percent of Afghan poppy is cultivated.
Drug-related corruption in Afghanistan--one of the most intransigent 
problems in the country--must be confronted, particularly at provincial 
and district government levels. Corruption and illegal drugs in 
Afghanistan threaten to undermine all aspects of the country's efforts 
to build a sustainable economic infrastructure and functioning 
democracy.
The United States enjoys close cooperation with Canada across a broad 
range of law enforcement issues. Both of our nations face a serious 
challenge from the 2-way flow of drugs across our long border. While 
Canada is primarily a drug consuming country, it is also a significant 
producer of highly potent marijuana and has become the primary source 
country for MDMA (ecstasy) available in the United States. Additionally, 
Canada serves as a transit or diversion point for precursor chemicals 
and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals used to produce illicit synthetic 
drugs, most notably MDMA. While methamphetamine use has decreased in the 
United States, due in large part to past efforts to reduce precursor 
chemical diversion by Canadian authorities, production of finished 
methamphetamine is increasing in Canada and could lead to greater 
supplies in the United States. Canada is pursuing a new National Anti-
Drug Strategy that focuses on proven approaches to reduce drug use and 
deter drug trafficking. The United States and Canada continue to work 
productively in joint law enforcement operations that disrupt drug and 
currency smuggling operations along the border.
The growing expansion of drug trafficking in Central America poses 
serious challenges to the region's limited capability to combat both the 
narcotics trade and organized crime. We are particularly concerned about 
the increasing presence of drug trafficking organizations in Central 
America that are fleeing more robust counternarcotics regimes elsewhere, 
especially in Mexico and Colombia. Often unimpeded, traffickers use long 
Central American coastlines for illegal maritime drug shipments. Even 
though there have been noteworthy seizures, a high proportion of drugs 
transiting Central America are not detected or seized.
The March 2008 gun battle between drug organizations in Guatemala 
demonstrates that criminal organizations such as the Sinaloa cartel are 
trying to reinforce their trafficking strongholds in Central America. In 
2008, Guatemala passed new anti-organized crime and extradition laws. 
While such actions are encouraging, Guatemala must work aggressively to 
implement these measures, just as neighboring countries must redouble 
their practical efforts to implement adopted reforms aimed at thwarting 
criminal activity.
The United States is encouraged by the commitment of the Regional 
Integration System to a regional response, such as sharing 
counternarcotics intelligence. Support for cohesive regional 
institution-building and practical law enforcement enhancements in 
Central America are critical components

[[Page 299]]

to a successful regional counternarcotics strategy. We look forward to 
working with Guatemala and other Central American nations to support 
counternarcotics programs and the rule of law under the new Merida 
Initiative.
The Government of Ecuador is committed to protecting its borders and 
territory against drug trafficking and other transnational crimes. The 
increased presence of Ecuadorian security forces in its counternarcotics 
efforts provided a more effective deterrent to drug production and 
trafficking. The identification of new trafficking trends and increased 
staffing and inspection at all air, land, and sea ports are also helping 
to hinder drug trafficking. With a system for tracking vessels already 
in place, Ecuador is expanding this capability and more effectively 
utilizing it as a tool for working with partner nations. The country's 
ability to identify the nationality of ships is of special concern as 
considerable cocaine destined for the United States has been detected on 
Ecuadorian-flagged vessels.
The countries of West Africa have emerged as key transit hubs for Andean 
cocaine trafficked through Venezuela and Brazil and destined for 
European markets. This trafficking is undermining many of the already 
fragile institutions of countries in the region. Narcotics traffickers 
have focused their illegal activities in Guinea-Bissau, but have 
recently extended their operations south to Guinea. The presence of 
Latin American drug traffickers and the large quantities of cocaine 
trafficked openly suggest that drug criminals may exercise the 
prerogatives of sovereign nation-states in these two countries. West 
Africa has long been a hub for illicit criminal networks. West African 
states lack resources to sufficiently counter efforts by drug 
trafficking organizations whose activity threatens the stability of 
these countries and the well-being of their people.
International donors and organizations are working to assist governments 
in their counternarcotic efforts. We support these efforts to preserve 
and protect stability and positive growth in this region.
Nigeria, a major transit country for illicit drugs destined for the 
United States, continues to make some progress on counternarcotics and 
has cooperated effectively with the United States on drug-related money 
laundering cases. Since it began operations in 2005, the Nigerian 
Financial Intelligence Unit has investigated numerous suspicious 
transaction reports that have resulted in high-profile convictions 
recorded by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). 
However, recent developments in Nigeria raise questions about whether 
the EFCC will remain an effective anticorruption agency. The United 
States Government has had extradition requests pending in Nigeria for 
years and is concerned that Nigeria's extradition practices and 
procedures remain obstacles to the effectiveness of this essential 
counternarcotics law enforcement tool. We are encouraged that Nigeria's 
use of U.S.-donated body scanners at its four major international 
airports has resulted in the arrest of numerous drug traffickers. 
Moreover, we fully support the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency's 
recent cooperation in regional search and seizure operations.
The Government of India maintains a strong track record of regulating, 
monitoring, and curbing its licit opium production and distribution 
process. India has introduced robust, high-tech methods to control 
cultivation by licensed opium farmers. In this sense, India must 
continue to refine its control measures to guard against the continuing 
problem of diversion of licit opium crops, grown for the production of 
pharmaceutical products, to

[[Page 300]]

illegal markets. The United States continues to be concerned about 
illicit opium poppy production in certain areas of the country, such as 
West Bengal and the state of Uttaranchal along the India-China Border, 
previously thought to be free of such cultivation. Nevertheless, during 
the past year the country has destroyed substantial areas of illicit 
poppy cultivation. The Indian Government must also continue to 
investigate cases of large, illicit poppy production and accordingly 
bring perpetrators to trial. The United States, along with other foreign 
governments and international organizations, has a good working 
relationship with India to interdict the flow of narcotics being 
smuggled across India's borders.

section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in 
the Federal Register.

Notice of September 18, 2008

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Persons Who 
Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or 
support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the grave acts 
of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, 
including the terrorist attacks in New York, in Pennsylvania, and 
against the Pentagon committed on September 11, 2001, and the continuing 
and immediate threat of further attacks against United States nationals 
or the United States. Because the actions of these persons who commit, 
threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the United States, the national emergency 
declared on September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date to 
deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23, 
2008. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to 
commit, or support terrorism.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

On October 27, 2006, by Executive Order 13413, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo and, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), ordered related 
measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the

Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and 
atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability.
Because this situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary

the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, 
expanded the scope of the national emergency to deal with that threat, 
and ordered the blocking of property of certain persons connected to the 
conflict. On October 13, 2006, I issued Executive Order 13412 to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency and to implement 
the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344).

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such 
weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13094 
amending Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the 
worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation 
activities. On June 28, 2005, I issued Executive Order 13382 that, inter 
alia, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our ability to 
combat proliferation. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States; therefore, the national emergency first 
declared on November 14, 1994, and extended in each subsequent year,

Memorandum of November 25, 2008

Provision of Marine War Risk Insurance Coverage

Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of Transportation 
[and] the Director of the Office of Management And Budget
By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, including 3 U.S.C. 301 and 46 U.S.C. chapter 539, I 
hereby approve the provision by the Secretary of Transportation of 
insurance or reinsurance of vessels (including cargo and crew) against 
loss or damage from war risks in the manner and to the extent provided 
in chapter 539 of title 46, United States Code, for trade in the Black 
Sea, whenever, after consultation with the Secretary of State, it 
appears to the Secretary of Transportation that such insurance adequate 
for the needs of the water-borne commerce of the United States cannot be 
obtained on reasonable terms and conditions from companies authorized to 
do insurance business in a State of the United States. To the extent 
individual policies involve an exposure in excess of the amounts 
available in the War Risk Revolving Fund, such policies may be issued 
only after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget. This 
approval to provide insurance or reinsurance is effective for 90 days, 
except that existing policies shall remain in force pursuant to the 
terms of these policies. I hereby delegate to the Secretary of 
Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the 
authority vested in me by 46 U.S.C. 53902 and 53905.

[[Page 315]]

The Secretary of Transportation is directed to bring the approval to the 
immediate attention of all U.S.-flag vessel operators and to arrange for 
its publication in the Federal Register.

discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or 
activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are 
not, themselves, covered by this regulation.
    (c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from the benefits of a 
program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals 
with handicaps or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with 
handicaps from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order 
to a different class of individuals with handicaps is not prohibited by 
this regulation.
    (d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most 
integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals 
with handicaps.

Sec. 102.140  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 102.141-102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 327]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec. 102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

[[Page 328]]

apply to buildings covered by this section.


<R05>
Sec. Sec. 102.152-102.159  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

Sec. Sec. 102.161-102.169  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.170  Compliance procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 791).
    (c) The Director, Facilities Management, Office of Administration, 
Executive Office of the President, shall be responsible for coordinating 
implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to the Director 
at the following address: Room 486, Old Executive Office Building, 17th 
and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.

[[Page 329]]

    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec. 102.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for 
making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.
