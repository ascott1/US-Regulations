                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2004), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2003 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2003 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 7636 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2003 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2004, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
     statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
 Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
      Division by Stephen J. Frattini and Kathleen M. Fargey, under the 
     supervision of Gwendolyn J. Henderson. Karen L. Ashlin and John S. 
                                          Ashlin were assistant editors.

Proc. 7636

Proclamation 7636 of January 2, 2003

National Mentoring Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Across our great Nation, many Americans are responding to the 
          call to service by mentoring a child in need. By offering 
          love, guidance, and encouragement, mentors put hope in 
          children's hearts, and help ensure that young people realize 
          their full potential. During National Mentoring Month, we 
          recognize the vital contributions of dedicated mentors, and we 
          encourage more Americans to make a difference in the hearts 
          and souls of our communities by volunteering their time to 
          meet the needs of America's youth.
          Volunteers provide friendship and support to young people who 
          are facing challenging situations, serve as positive role 
          models, and help to instill important values, goals, and 
          skills. Mentors help young Americans build confidence, gain 
          knowledge, and develop the character necessary to make the 
          right choices and achieve their dreams. Statistics show that 
          at-risk children with mentors demonstrate improved academic 
          performance and are less likely to be involved in destructive 
          activities such as drugs, alcohol, and violence.
          During these extraordinary times, we are experiencing a 
          growing culture of service, citizenship, and compassion in our 
          country, with millions of Americans sacrificing for causes 
          greater than self. Dedicated individuals are getting involved 
          in mentoring through faith-based and community organizations, 
          corporate initiatives, school-based programs, and many other 
          outlets for kindness. By dedicating their time and their 
          talents to offer a child a quality relationship with a caring 
          adult, mentors strengthen our families and our communities and 
          reflect the true spirit of America.

[[Page 2]]

          Many Americans can point to individuals who influenced their 
          lives and helped to shape them into who they are today. 
          Whether they were teachers, coaches, relatives, clergy, or 
          other community leaders, these positive role models have been 
          critical to our healthy development and helped to instill 
          purpose in our lives. As we honor these everyday heroes, we 
          also recognize that there is a great need for more mentors in 
          America. Too many children in our Nation are growing up 
          without enough support and guidance in their lives, and we 
          must work to ensure that no child is left behind.
          This month, I encourage all Americans to become a mentor and 
          change the life of a child in need. In July, the National 
          Mentoring Partnership helped establish the USA Freedom Corps 
          Volunteer Network_the largest system in the Nation for 
          matching individuals with volunteer opportunities. I am proud 
          of this partnership and ask individuals to go online at 
          www.usafreedomcorps.gov or call 1	877	USACORPS to find 
          millions of ways to help children in their neighborhoods. 
          Together, we can reaffirm the promise of America and point the 
          way to a brighter future for all of our children.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim January 2003 as National Mentoring Month. I call upon 
          the people of the United States to recognize the importance of 
          being role models for our youth, to look for mentoring 
          opportunities in their communities, and to celebrate this 
          month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second 
          day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-seventh.

GEORGE W. BUSH

Proc. 7637

Proclamation 7637 of January 10, 2003

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of Preferences

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Pursuant to section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
          (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2462), the President is 
          authorized to designate countries as beneficiary developing 
          countries, and to designate any beneficiary developing country 
          as a least-developed beneficiary developing country, for 
          purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
          Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of title V of the 1974 Act (19 
          U.S.C. 2463(c)(1)), the President may withdraw, suspend, or 
          limit the application of duty-free treatment accorded under 
          this title with respect to any article.
          Section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(5)) 
          provides that any waiver granted under section 503(d) of the 
          1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d))

[[Page 3]]

          shall remain in effect until the President determines that 
          such waiver is no longer warranted due to changed 
          circumstances.
          Section 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(b)(1)) 
          authorizes the President to provide duty-free treatment for 
          any article described in section 503(b)(1)(B) through (G) of 
          the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(b)(1)(B)	(G)) that is the growth, 
          product, or manufacture of a designated beneficiary sub-
          Saharan African country, if, after receiving the advice of the 
          United States International Trade Commission (USITC), the 
          President determines that such article is not import-sensitive 
          in the context of imports from beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          countries.
          Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and taking into 
          account the factors set forth in section 502(c) (19 U.S.C. 
          2462(c)), I have decided to designate Afghanistan as a 
          beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
          Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and having considered 
          the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I have also 
          decided to designate Afghanistan as a least-developed 
          beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
          Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having 
          considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I 
          have determined to withdraw the application of duty-free 
          treatment under the GSP accorded to a certain article from 
          Chile.
          Pursuant to section 503(d)(5), I have determined that the 
          waiver granted under section 503(d) to Chile for a certain 
          article is no longer warranted due to changed circumstances.
          Pursuant to section 506A(b)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having 
          received the advice of the USITC, I have determined that a 
          certain article is not import-sensitive in the context of 
          imports from beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. I have 
          decided to provide duty-free treatment to this article when 
          imported from any beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
          Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the 
          President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
          United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions 
          of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and 
          actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
          continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
          restriction.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, 
          including title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
          2461	7, 2483), do proclaim that:
          (1) In order to reflect in the HTS the addition of Afghanistan 
          as a beneficiary developing country and as a least-developed 
          beneficiary developing country under the GSP, and the 
          withdrawal of duty-free treatment under the GSP accorded to a 
          certain article from Chile, general note 4 to the HTS is 
          modified as provided in section A of the Annex to this 
          proclamation.
          (2) In order to provide duty-free treatment for a certain 
          article when imported from a beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          country, the HTS is modified by amending and sub-dividing the 
          nomenclature of an existing HTS subheading as provided in 
          section B of the Annex to this proclamation.

[[Page 4]]

          (3) In order to provide that Chile should not be treated as a 
          beneficiary developing country with respect to a certain 
          eligible article for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1	
          Special subcolumn for the HTS subheading enumerated in section 
          C of the Annex to this proclamation is modified as provided in 
          such section.
          (4) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2) of the 
          1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)) previously granted to Chile 
          for HTS subheading 0811.20.20 shall be terminated on the date 
          of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register
          (5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive 
          Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this 
          proclamation are superseded to the extent of such 
          inconsistency.
          (6) (a) The modifications made by section A of the Annex to 
          this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles 
          entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
          after the dates set forth in that section.
           (b) The modifications made by section B of the Annex to this 
          proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles 
          entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
          after the fifteenth day after the date of publication of this 
          proclamation in the Federal Register.

Proclamation 7638 of January 13, 2003

The Centennial of Korean Immigration to the United States

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          From every corner of the world, immigrants have come to 
          America to discover the promise of our Nation. On January 13, 
          1903, the first Korean immigrants to the United States arrived 
          in Honolulu, Hawaii, on the SS Gaelic. Today, Korean Americans 
          live throughout the United States, representing one of our 
          largest Asian-American populations. As we commemorate the 
          centennial anniversary of Korean immigration to the United 
          States, we recognize the invaluable contributions of Korean 
          Americans to our Nation's rich cultural diversity, economic 
          strength, and proud heritage.
          For the past century, Korean immigrants and their descendants 
          have helped build America's prosperity, strengthened America's 
          communities, and defended America's freedoms. Through their 
          service in World War I, World War II, the Korean Conflict, the 
          Vietnam War, and other wars, Korean Americans have served our 
          Nation with honor and courage, upholding the values that make 
          our country strong.
          The American and Korean people share a love of freedom and a 
          dedication to peace. The United States was the first Western 
          country to sign a treaty of commerce and amity with Korea in 
          1882, promising ``perpetual peace and friendship'' between our 
          nations. Since that time, the United States has built a strong 
          friendship with Korea_a friendship based on our common 
          commitment to human dignity, prosperity, and democracy. In the 
          coming months, more than 1 million Korean Americans throughout 
          our Nation will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the arrival 
          of the first Korean immigrants to the United States. During 
          this time, we acknowledge and commend Korean Americans for 
          their distinguished achievements in all sectors of life and 
          for their important role in building, defending, and 
          sustaining the United States of America.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim January 13, 2003, as the Centennial of Korean 
          Immigration to the United States. I call upon all Americans to 
          observe the anniversary with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
          and activities honoring Korean immigrants and their 
          descendants for their countless contributions to America.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          thirteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States 
          of America the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7639 of January 14, 2003

National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Our Nation was built on a promise of life and liberty for all 
          citizens. Guided by a deep respect for human dignity, our 
          Founding Fathers worked to secure these rights for future 
          generations, and today we continue to seek to fulfill their 
          promise in our laws and our society. On National Sanctity of 
          Human Life Day, we reaffirm the value of human life and renew 
          our dedication to ensuring that every American has access to 
          life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
          As we seek to improve quality of life, overcome illness, and 
          promote vital medical research, my Administration will 
          continue to honor our country's founding ideals of equal 
          dignity and equal rights for every American. Every child is a 
          priority and a blessing, and I believe that all should be 
          welcomed in life and protected by law. My Administration has 
          championed compassionate alternatives to abortion, such as 
          helping women in crisis through maternity group homes, 
          encouraging adoption, promoting abstinence education, and 
          passing laws requiring parental notification and waiting 
          periods for minors.
          The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which I signed into law 
          in August 2002, is an important contribution to our efforts to 
          care for human life. This important legislation helps protect 
          the most vulnerable members of our society by ensuring that 
          every infant born alive, including one who survives abortion, 
          is considered a person and receives protection under Federal 
          law. It helps achieve the promises of the Declaration of 
          Independence for all, including those without the voice and 
          power to defend their own rights.
          Through ethical policies and the compassion of Americans, we 
          will continue to build a culture that respects life. Faith- 
          based and community organizations and individual citizens play 
          a critical role in strengthening our neighborhoods and 
          bringing care and comfort to those in need. By helping fellow 
          citizens, these groups recognize the dignity of every human 
          being and the possibilities of every life; and their important 
          efforts are helping to build a more just and generous Nation. 
          By working together to protect the weak, the imperfect, and 
          the unwanted, we affirm a culture of hope and help ensure a 
          brighter future for all.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim Sunday, January 19, 2003, as National Sanctity of 
          Human Life Day. As we reflect upon the sanctity of human life, 
          I call upon all Americans to recognize this day with 
          appropriate ceremonies in our homes and places of worship, to 
          rededicate ourselves to compassionate service, and to reaffirm 
          our commitment to respecting the life and dignity of every 
          human being.

[[Page 9]]

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          fourteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States 
          of America the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7640 of January 15, 2003

Religious Freedom Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Each year on January 16, we celebrate Religious Freedom Day in 
          commemoration of the passage of the Virginia Statute for 
          Religious Freedom by the Virginia General Assembly, which 
          occurred on this day in 1786. Drafted by Thomas Jefferson, 
          this historic law provided the inspiration and the framework 
          for the religious freedom clauses in the First Amendment to 
          the United States Constitution.
          The religious freedom provisions of our Constitution_the 
          Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause_open the 
          first of the ten amendments that make up the Bill of Rights. 
          Because the Framers placed the guarantee of religious freedom 
          before other cherished rights, religious liberty in America is 
          often called the first freedom. The right to have religious 
          beliefs and to freely practice such beliefs are among the most 
          fundamental freedoms we possess. James Madison once said that 
          ``the Religion then of every man must be left to the 
          conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of 
          every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is 
          in its nature an unalienable right.''
          Our Founding Fathers recognized that religious freedom is a 
          right we must protect with great vigilance. We must continue 
          our efforts to uphold justice and tolerance and to oppose 
          prejudice; and we must be resolved to countering any means 
          that infringe on religious freedom.
          Religious faith has inspired many of our fellow citizens to 
          help build a better Nation. In America today, people of faith 
          continue to wage a determined campaign to meet needs and fight 
          suffering. Through the efforts of the White House Office of 
          Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, my Administration has 
          been working to ensure that faith-inspired organizations do 
          not face discrimination simply because of their religious 
          orientation. I recently signed an Executive Order to ensure 
          equal treatment for faith-based charities that are offering 
          hope to those in need.
          As we celebrate the freedom of faith in America, we also 
          recognize that there are many people around the world who do 
          not enjoy such freedoms. The right to believe and express 
          one's beliefs in words and practice is a right that should 
          belong to all people. Through the Department of State's Office 
          of International Religious Freedom, my Administration has been 
          working to call attention to religious persecution and to 
          encourage our allies, friends, and trading partners to provide 
          and protect this fundamental human right for all people around 
          the world. By working together to secure

[[Page 10]]

          religious freedom around the world, we can create a better 
          future for people of all faiths.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim January 16, 2003, as Religious Freedom Day. I 
          encourage all Americans to reflect on the great blessing of 
          religious freedom and to endeavor to preserve this freedom for 
          future generations, and to commemorate this day through 
          appropriate events and activities in homes, schools, and 
          places of worship.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth 
          day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7641 of January 17, 2003

To Modify Rules of Origin Under the North American Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          1. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, 
          implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement (the 
          ``NAFTA'') with respect to the United States and, pursuant to 
          the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act 
          (the ``NAFTA Implementation Act''), incorporated in the 
          Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (the ``HTS'') 
          the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or 
          appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
          2. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act provides rules 
          for determining whether goods imported into the United States 
          originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are 
          eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under 
          the NAFTA. Section 202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 
          U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes the President to proclaim, as a 
          part of the HTS, the rules of origin set out in the NAFTA and 
          to proclaim modifications to such previously proclaimed rules 
          of origin, subject to the consultation and layover 
          requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act 
          (19 U.S.C. 3313(a)).
          3. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS 
          proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to sections 201 and 
          202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act are appropriate. For goods 
          of Mexico, I have decided that the effective date of the 
          modifications shall be determined by the United States Trade 
          Representative (USTR).
          4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
          ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to 
          embody in the HTS the substance

[[Page 11]]

          of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other acts 
          affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including 
          the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any 
          rate of duty or other import restriction.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including 
          section 604 of the 1974 Act, section 202 of the NAFTA 
          Implementation Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States 
          Code, do hereby proclaim:
          (1) In order to modify the rules of origin under the NAFTA, 
          general note 12 to the HTS is modified as provided in the 
          Annex to this proclamation.
          (2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive 
          Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this 
          proclamation are superseded to the extent of such 
          inconsistency.
          (3) The modifications made by the Annex to this proclamation 
          shall be effective with respect to goods of Canada that are 
          entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
          after January 1, 2003. The modifications made by such Annex 
          shall be effective with respect to goods of Mexico that are 
          entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
          after a date to be announced in the Federal Register by the 
          USTR.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          seventeenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States 
          of America the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7642 of January 17, 2003

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., served as a voice of conscience 
          for our Nation, and his words and actions continue to inspire 
          courage, humility, and compassion. As a visionary leader of 
          the civil rights movement, Dr. King helped to advance human 
          dignity by working peacefully to resolve racial conflict 
          through speeches, marches, and countless nonviolent activities 
          that helped our Nation recognize the importance of upholding 
          fully our founding ideals of equality, tolerance, and justice 
          for all. Dr. King's enduring contributions to America remind 
          us and countless others around the world that people should 
          ``. . . not be judged by the color of their skin but by 
          content of their character.'' He also taught us that lasting 
          achievement in life comes through sacrifice and service. His 
          devotion to helping others reflected the true spirit of 
          service and citizenship, and his example continues to motivate 
          individuals to serve causes greater than themselves.
          Dr. King wrote that ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to 
          justice everywhere.'' As Americans celebrate the 18th national 
          commemoration of the life and legacy of this great leader, we 
          recognize the lasting truth of his words and his legacy, and 
          we renew our commitment to the principles of justice, 
          equality, opportunity, and optimism that Dr. King espoused and 
          exemplified.
          As we honor Dr. King's accomplishments, we pledge to work for 
          a Nation in which all people of every race realize the promise 
          of America. No government policy can put hope in people's 
          hearts or a sense of purpose in people's lives; but we can and 
          will continue to support efforts that seek to secure a Nation 
          of dignity, liberty, and compassion.
          To achieve this goal, our Nation must work to ensure that all 
          American children have an equal chance to succeed and reach 
          their full potential. One year ago this month, our country set 
          a bold new course in public education with the passage of the 
          No Child Left Behind Act, ushering in an era of 
          accountability, local control, and high standards. This Act 
          affirmed our faith in the wisdom of parents and communities 
          and our fundamental belief in the promise of every child. 
          Across America, States and school districts are working 
          diligently to implement reforms called for by this important 
          legislation, which will produce better results for all of our 
          students. My Administration is committed to these efforts, and 
          I will continue working with the Congress to enact reforms and 
          provide support to help build the mind and character of every 
          child from every background in every part of America. By 
          working together to advance Dr. King's ideals of equality and 
          acceptance, we can achieve his dream of a Nation united in 
          understanding, defined in promise, and guided by hope.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim Monday, January 20, 2003, as the Martin Luther King, 
          Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans

[[Page 16]]

          to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and 
          service programs and activities in honor of Dr. King's life 
          and legacy.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          seventeenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States 
          of America the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7643 of January 27, 2003

National Consumer Protection Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Few technologies have become fixtures in our daily lives as 
          quickly as computers and the Internet. Today, more than half 
          of all Americans log on to the Internet, and that number is 
          growing. Our access to information, entertainment, credit and 
          banking, products, and services from every corner of the world 
          is greater than ever before. As our personal information 
          becomes more accessible, consumers, corporations, and 
          government agencies must take precautions against the misuse 
          of that information.
          Computer technology and the Internet have revolutionized our 
          ability to communicate and share knowledge. This new freedom 
          offers incredible opportunities; but as individuals and as a 
          Nation, we must guard against the misuse of personal 
          information and identity theft. The theme of this year's 
          National Consumer Protection Week is ``Information Security,'' 
          and during this week we resolve to help all Americans learn 
          how to keep personal information secure.
          For consumers, securing a computer is a matter of routine 
          maintenance and caution. Effective passwords, firewalls, and 
          up-to-date antivirus software can help protect computers, and 
          the personal or business information we store on them, from 
          those who would damage a network operation or steal personal 
          information to commit a crime. By practicing effective 
          information security measures, all citizens can contribute to 
          the protection of our national information infrastructure.
          To assist consumers, public and private entities have joined 
          forces to highlight the importance of information security. 
          They include the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Postal 
          Service, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Federal 
          Consumer Information Center, the National Association of 
          Attorneys General, the National Consumers League, the American 
          Association of Retired Persons, the Better Business Bureau, 
          the Consumer Federation of America, and the National 
          Association of Consumer Agency Administrators. The National 
          Strategy to Secure Cyberspace also offers guidance for the 
          full range of computer users on information security. By 
          working together, we can help consumers and businesses 
          understand how information security affects their decisions at 
          home and in the marketplace.

[[Page 17]]

          During National Consumer Protection Week, I encourage all 
          Americans to take the appropriate steps to ensure the security 
          of their personal or sensitive information. By learning ways 
          to safeguard this data, individuals can help ensure their 
          financial security, and contribute to the strength and 
          prosperity of our Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim February 2 through 8, 2003, as National Consumer 
          Protection Week. I call upon Government officials, industry 
          leaders, and consumer advocates to provide consumers with 
          information about how we can help safeguard the economic 
          future of all Americans by keeping our personal information 
          secure.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          seventh day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7644 of January 30, 2003

American Heart Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Advances in medical research have significantly improved our 
          capacity to fight heart disease by providing greater knowledge 
          about its causes, more innovative diagnostic tools to detect 
          and counter it, and new and improved treatments that help 
          people survive and recover from it. Despite these advances, 
          heart disease continues to be America's number one killer. 
          During American Heart Month, we renew our commitment to 
          fighting cardiovascular disease by encouraging our citizens to 
          learn more about its risk factors, its various warning signs, 
          and life-saving emergency response techniques.
          Heart attacks result when the blood supply to part of the 
          heart muscle is severely reduced or stopped. Because many 
          heart attack victims do not recognize the warning signs until 
          it is too late, only one in five is able to reach a hospital 
          quickly enough to benefit fully from treatments. To help 
          Americans survive heart attacks, the National Heart, Lung, and 
          Blood Institute (NHLBI), which is part of the National 
          Institutes of Health, has joined with the American Heart 
          Association (AHA) and other national organizations to create a 
          major educational campaign, called ``Act in Time to Heart 
          Attack Signs.'' This campaign encourages Americans to learn 
          the warning signs of a heart attack and to call 911 within 
          minutes_five at most_of the start of symptoms. The campaign 
          also offers educational materials for both the general public 
          and healthcare professionals to encourage communication among 
          doctors, other healthcare providers, and their patients about 
          the importance of recognizing heart attack signs and getting 
          treatment quickly.

[[Page 18]]

          Far too many Americans are also unaware of the dangers of 
          cardiac arrest, in which the heart suddenly loses its ability 
          to function. Most cases of cardiac arrest that result in 
          sudden death occur when the diseased heart's electrical 
          impulses become rapid and then chaotic. About 95 percent of 
          sudden cardiac arrest victims die before reaching the 
          hospital. However, if treated within a few minutes, cardiac 
          arrest can be reversed through defibrillation, an electric 
          shock that allows the heart to resume a normal beat.
          Research has shown that early cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
          (CPR) and rapid defibrillation, combined with early advanced 
          care, can produce long-term survival rates of 40 percent where 
          a cardiac arrest has been witnessed by a bystander. The AHA 
          has developed a nationwide educational campaign called 
          ``Operation Heartbeat,'' to increase public awareness about 
          cardiac arrest. ``Operation Heartbeat'' is educating the 
          public about the warning signs of cardiac arrest, the 
          importance of calling 911 immediately, and the benefits of 
          administering CPR until defibrillation can be given.
          When Americans take personal steps to improve their health, 
          our whole society benefits. By developing good eating habits, 
          being physically active, taking advantage of preventive 
          screenings, and avoiding drugs, tobacco, and excessive use of 
          alcohol, individuals and families can significantly reduce the 
          onset and burden of heart disease. In promoting new education 
          programs, supporting research, expanding access to life-saving 
          tools, and encouraging our citizens to learn more about 
          cardiovascular disease and lead healthy lifestyles, we can 
          save lives.
          In recognition of the important ongoing fight against 
          cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution 
          approved December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 
          U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual 
          proclamation designating February as ``American Heart Month.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2003 as 
          American Heart Month. I invite the Governors of the States, 
          the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas 
          subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the 
          American people to join me in reaffirming our commitment to 
          combating cardiovascular disease.

Proclamation 7645 of January 31, 2003

National African American History Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          African Americans have played central roles in some of the 
          most triumphant and courageous moments in our Nation's 
          history. During National African American History Month, we 
          honor the rich heritage of African Americans and pay tribute 
          to their many contributions to our Nation. As

[[Page 19]]

          we celebrate this year's theme, ``The Souls of Black Folk: 
          Centennial Reflections,'' we remember the successes and 
          challenges of our past. We also resolve to honor the 
          achievements and legacy of these proud citizens by continuing 
          to improve our society so that it fully lives up to our 
          founding ideals.
          In 1915, Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson recognized the need for our 
          country to gain a more complete and informed understanding of 
          our past. He founded the Association for the Study of Negro 
          Life and History and established the first Negro History Week 
          to emphasize that ``We have a wonderful history behind us . . 
          . `` Through the pioneering efforts of Dr. Woodson and the 
          hard work of the Association, this observance officially 
          became Black History Month in 1976.
          For generations, African Americans have strengthened our 
          Nation by urging reforms, overcoming obstacles, and breaking 
          down barriers. We see the greatness of America in those who 
          have risen above injustice and enriched our society, a 
          greatness reflected in the resolve of Jackie Robinson, the 
          intellect of W.E.B. DuBois, and the talent of Louis Armstrong. 
          We also gain a deeper appreciation for the African-American 
          experience in the writings of James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, 
          and Zora Neal Hurston, as well as in the music of Mahalia 
          Jackson, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, and countless others.
          African Americans reflect a proud legacy of courage and 
          dedication that has helped to guide our Nation's success and 
          prosperity. Visionary leaders like Frederick Douglass, 
          Thurgood Marshall, and Martin Luther King, Jr., possessed a 
          clarity of purpose and were instrumental in exposing and 
          addressing the issues that threatened our founding principles. 
          The battle for freedom, equality, and opportunity was fought 
          on the front lines by strong figures such as Harriet Tubman 
          and Fannie Lou Hamer, as well as many other everyday heroes 
          who helped to lead this Nation to a more hopeful and just 
          society.
          As we recall these remarkable individuals, we also recognize 
          that, despite our progress, racial prejudice still exists in 
          America. As a Nation and as individuals, we must be vigilant 
          in responding to discrimination wherever we find it. By 
          promoting diversity, understanding, and opportunity, we will 
          continue our efforts to build a society where every person, of 
          every race, can realize the promise of America.
          This month, I encourage all citizens to gain awareness of and 
          appreciation for African-American history. As we remember this 
          important part of our Nation's past, we look to a bright 
          future, recognizing the potential of an America united in 
          purpose, guided by spirit, and dedicated to equality.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim February 2003 as National African American History 
          Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, 
          and all of the people of the United States to observe this 
          month with appropriate programs and activities that highlight 
          and honor the myriad of contributions that African Americans 
          have made to our Nation.

Proclamation 7647 of February 7, 2003

Establishment of the Governors Island National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          On the north tip of Governors Island, at the confluence of the 
          Hudson and East Rivers, stand two fortifications that served 
          as an outpost to protect New York City from sea attack. These 
          two important historic objects, Castle Williams and Fort Jay, 
          are part of a National Historic Landmark District designated 
          in 1985. Between 1806 and 1811, these fortifications were 
          constructed as part of the First and Second American Systems 
          of Coastal Fortification. Castle Williams and Fort Jay 
          represent two of the finest examples of defensive structures 
          in use from the Renaissance to the American Civil

[[Page 21]]

          War. They also played important roles in the War of 1812, the 
          American Civil War, and World Wars I and II.
          These fortifications were built on the most strategic 
          defensive positions on the island. Fort Jay, constructed 
          between 1806 and 1809, is on the highest point of the island 
          from which its glacis originally sloped down to the waterfront 
          on all sides. Castle Williams, constructed between 1807 and 
          1811, occupies a rocky promontory as close as possible to the 
          harbor channels and served as the most important strategic 
          defensive point in the entrance to the New York Harbor.
          Governors Island was managed by the United States Army and the 
          United States Coast Guard for nearly 200 years, but is no 
          longer required for defense or Coast Guard purposes. It 
          provides an excellent opportunity for the public to observe 
          and understand the harbor history, its defense, and its 
          ecology. Its proximity to lower Manhattan also makes it an 
          appropriate location from which to reflect upon the tragic 
          events of September 11, 2001.
          Section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
          431) (the ``Antiquities Act''), authorizes the President, in 
          his discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic 
          landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other 
          objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated 
          upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the 
          United States to be national monuments, and to reserve as a 
          part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases 
          shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the 
          proper care and management of the objects to be protected.
          A Governors Island National Monument was established by 
          Proclamation 7402 of January 19, 2001, in order to protect the 
          two fortifications. The monument, however, remained subject to 
          Public Law 105	33, section 9101, 111 Stat. 670 (August 5, 
          1997), which required the entire island, including the 
          monument lands, to be sold with a right of first offer to the 
          State and City of New York.
          WHEREAS the State and City of New York each executed a consent 
          and waiver of the right of first offer regarding Governors 
          Island; and
          WHEREAS the portion of Governors Island described on the 
          accompanying land description was sold to the National Trust 
          for Historic Preservation (National Trust), on January 31, 
          2003, and the remainder of Governors Island was sold to the 
          Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation 
          (GIPEC) of the State and City of New York, on January 31, 
          2003; and
          WHEREAS the National Trust, on January 31, 2003, relinquished 
          and conveyed to the United States of America all lands owned 
          by the National Trust on Governors Island; and
          WHEREAS such relinquishment and conveyance have been accepted 
          by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) pursuant to the 
          Antiquities Act; and
          WHEREAS it appears that it would be in the public interest to 
          preserve Castle Williams, Fort Jay, and certain lands and 
          buildings necessary for the care and management of the Castle 
          and Fort as the Governors Island National Monument;
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 
          of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), do 
          proclaim that there are hereby set

[[Page 22]]

          apart and reserved as the Governors Island National Monument 
          for the purpose of protecting the objects identified above, 
          all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the 
          United States within the boundaries described on the 
          accompanying land description, which is attached to and forms 
          a part of this proclamation. The Federal land and interests in 
          land reserved consist of approximately 22 acres, together with 
          appurtenant easements for all necessary purposes and any 
          associated federally owned personal property of historic 
          interest, which is the smallest area compatible with the 
          property care and management of the objects to be protected.
          All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries 
          of this monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from 
          all forms of entry, location, selection, sale, or leasing or 
          other disposition under the public land laws, including but 
          not limited to withdrawal from location, entry, and patent 
          under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws 
          relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.
          The Secretary shall manage the monument consistent with the 
          purposes and provisions of this proclamation. For the purpose

Proclamation 7648 of February 28, 2003

American Red Cross Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Throughout our history, Americans have been committed to 
          helping the suffering, the disadvantaged, and those in need of 
          help. The American Red Cross represents the compassion of our 
          Nation in action. During American Red Cross Month, we honor 
          this remarkable organization and recognize its proud heritage 
          of service.
          For more than 121 years, the Red Cross has upheld its mission 
          to provide relief to victims of disasters and to help people 
          prevent, prepare for, and respond to emergencies. Last year, 
          the Red Cross helped victims of more than 70,000 disasters, 
          ranging from dwelling fires to widespread catastrophes such as 
          hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, and wildfires. Around the 
          world, the Red Cross contributed to international efforts that 
          aided other countries devastated by natural disasters, 
          assisted people in getting access to safe drinking water, and 
          battled malnutrition and life-threatening diseases. More than 
          half a million U.S. military families received direct 
          assistance from the Red Cross, helping them stay connected 
          with their loved ones, despite difficult circumstances.
          The American Red Cross also strengthens our communities by 
          encouraging citizens to be involved and to help their 
          neighbors in need. Last year, more than 1.2 million everyday 
          heroes volunteered at their local Red Cross chapters, and 
          almost 12 million more took the time to learn lifesaving 
          skills such as first aid, CPR, and defibrillator use. And more 
          than 4 million citizens answered the call for blood donors, 
          giving 7.2 million blood donations through the American Red 
          Cross.
          During these times of great consequence, the mission of the 
          Red Cross is more critical than ever. As our Nation confronts 
          new challenges, the American Red Cross and its partners are 
          working with the Federal Government and the emergency planning 
          community to help keep America safe. Through its ``Together We 
          Prepare'' campaign, the Red Cross is a vital partner with the 
          Department of Homeland Security in empowering individuals and 
          families to protect themselves and be prepared for the 
          unexpected.
          Countless people across our country turn to the American Red 
          Cross every day for blood and blood products, disaster 
          assistance, and vital community services. We are grateful for 
          this essential and inspiring organization, and we celebrate 
          its legacy of help, hope, and healing for those in need.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red 
          Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the 
          Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim 
          March 2003 as American Red Cross Month. As we celebrate this 
          month, I call upon all citizens to become partners in 
          preparedness with their local Red Cross chapters and to become 
          active participants in advancing the noble mission of the 
          American Red Cross.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the

Proclamation 7649 of February 28, 2003

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          From the earliest days of our Republic, America has inspired 
          the hopes and dreams of countless individuals from around the 
          world who have come to share in our gifts of freedom, justice, 
          and opportunity. During Irish-American Heritage Month, we 
          celebrate the contributions of these talented and industrious 
          citizens and recognize their rich legacy of ingenuity, 
          creativity, and achievement.
          Throughout our history, America has welcomed millions of Irish 
          immigrants to its shores. These proud people arrived seeking a 
          better life for themselves, their families, and future 
          generations. Many courageous individuals came during the 
          terrible years of Ireland's Great Famine in the middle of the 
          19th century, and their road to prosperity was not easy. Many 
          faced significant obstacles, including discrimination and 
          poverty. Despite these challenges, Irish Americans have risen 
          to success in every sector of our society.
          Americans of Irish descent have played a vital role in shaping 
          our history and culture. Nineteen Presidents of the United 
          States have claimed Irish heritage. One-third to one-half of 
          the American troops during the Revolutionary War and 9 of the 
          56 signers of the Declaration of Independence were Irish 
          Americans. Irish Americans explored our frontiers, built many 
          of our Nation's bridges, canals, and railroads, and their 
          proud record of public service helped to fortify our 
          democracy.
          In all areas of American life, Irish Americans have made 
          significant and enduring contributions to our great country. 
          America is a better Nation because of the efforts of Irish 
          Americans like Henry Ford, who spurred innovation; Bing 
          Crosby, who entertained countless people around the world; and 
          activist Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, who worked for critical and 
          compassionate social reform. These individuals are just a few 
          of the many Irish Americans who helped to transform our 
          national identity and whose accomplishments reflect the 
          determination, joy, and hope of the Irish. The faith, 
          perseverance, and spirit of the Irish have helped to 
          strengthen our families, our communities, our ideals, and our 
          national character.
          Today, approximately one in four Americans can trace their 
          ancestry in part to Ireland's green shores, and we are proud 
          of and grateful for the many Irish Americans who continue to 
          enrich our country.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim March 2003 as Irish-American Heritage Month. I call 
          upon all Americans to observe this month by

[[Page 33]]

          learning about and commemorating the contributions of Irish 
          Americans to our Nation.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7650 of February 28, 2003

National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Colorectal cancer touches the lives of many Americans. This 
          year, it is estimated that more than 148,000 new cases of 
          colorectal cancer will be diagnosed. More than 56,000 people 
          may die from this disease, making it a leading cause of cancer 
          death in our Nation. We have achieved great progress in 
          understanding what causes colorectal cancer, and how it 
          develops and spreads. This fourth national observance once 
          again helps increase awareness. Increased awareness can help 
          us reach my Administration's goal, known as ``Healthy People 
          2010,'' administered by the Department of Health and Human 
          Services, to reduce the rate of colorectal cancer deaths by 34 
          percent by the year 2010.
          Like many cancers, the development of colorectal cancer can 
          take many years. Screening is an important tool to help detect 
          colorectal cancer early by identifying precancerous growths or 
          polyps, when treatment is more likely to be successful.
          More than 90 percent of people who are diagnosed with 
          colorectal cancer are over the age of 50. Yet, recent data 
          indicates that less than 40 percent of adults age 50 or older 
          have had one of the available colorectal cancer screening 
          tests within recommended intervals. Researchers estimate that 
          if everyone age 50 or older received regular colorectal cancer 
          screenings, at least one-third of the deaths would be 
          prevented.
          Individuals must realize the importance of talking with their 
          healthcare providers about when to begin screening, which 
          tests to have, the benefits and risks of each test, and how 
          often to schedule appointments. To help our citizens detect 
          this disease, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
          (CMS) provides Medicare coverage for regular colorectal cancer 
          screening tests to help detect precancerous conditions or 
          colorectal cancer early.
          The National Cancer Institute (NCI), a component of the 
          National Institutes of Health, is the Nation's principal 
          research agency in the fight against colorectal cancer. The 
          NCI invested approximately $245 million in 2002, and it will 
          dedicate an estimated $267 million this year to advance our 
          understanding of this disease. The Centers for Disease Control 
          and Prevention (CDC) also plays an important role in our 
          efforts to save lives and reduce the burden of colorectal 
          cancer. Last year, the CDC allocated $12 million

[[Page 34]]

          to educate the public and health professionals about 
          colorectal cancer screening, and to conduct and support 
          research efforts related to increasing national colorectal 
          cancer screening rates.
          The CDC, CMS, and NCI are participating together in the Screen 
          for Life: National Colorectal Cancer Action Campaign to 
          educate Americans aged 50 and older, particularly minority 
          groups, about the benefits of colorectal cancer screening. 
          Another coordinated effort is the Health Disparities 
          Collaboratives, a public-private partnership that involves the 
          Health Resources and Services Administration, CDC, NCI, and 
          the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. These groups are 
          focusing on screening and follow-up care for people who 
          traditionally lack access to quality health care.
          During this month, I encourage Americans to join me in the 
          crucial effort to save lives by taking action against 
          colorectal cancer by talking with healthcare providers about 
          screening, telling friends and family members about the 
          importance of early detection, and providing support for those 
          diagnosed with colorectal cancer. By working together to 
          increase awareness and supporting research about this disease, 
          we can make a difference in the lives of our citizens and 
          people around the world.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim March 2003 as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness 
          Month. I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our Nation's 
          continuing commitment to controlling and curing colorectal 
          cancer.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America

Women's History Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          As our Founding Fathers worked to develop the framework of our 
          Nation, Abigail Adams wrote to her husband: ``I long to hear 
          that you have declared an independency_and by the way in the 
          new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you 
          to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more 
          generous and favorable to them than your ancestors.'' An early 
          advocate of women's rights, a farm and financial manager, and 
          the mother of an American President, John Quincy Adams, 
          Abigail Adams is one of many American women who helped 
          establish the strength and vitality of our Nation. During 
          Women's History Month, we recognize the generations of 
          American women whose important contributions continue to shape 
          our Nation and enrich our society.

[[Page 35]]

          Through vision, hard work, and determination, countless 
          American women have broadened opportunities for themselves and 
          for others at home, in the community, and in the workplace. In 
          1809, Mary Kies became the first woman to receive a U.S. 
          patent. By developing a method of weaving straw with silk, she 
          helped advance American industry and set an inspiring example 
          for other American women. Her pioneering efforts helped define 
          our country's entrepreneurial spirit and paved the way for 
          future generations of women to take pride in their talents and 
          creativity.
          Since Mary Kies' groundbreaking achievement, many American 
          women have become successful entrepreneurs and business 
          professionals. In 1905, Madam C.J. Walker started her own 
          business by creating and selling hair care products for 
          African-American women. After a decade, her company was highly 
          successful and employed more than 3,000 people, and at the 
          time, was the largest African-American owned business in the 
          United States. Today, Madam Walker is remembered for her 
          business accomplishments, efforts to create new opportunities 
          for women, and for her contributions to her community.
          Driven by the legacy of these extraordinary figures, American 
          women from all backgrounds continue to break barriers and 
          fulfill their personal and professional potential. At the dawn 
          of the 21st century, women have more choices than ever before. 
          Between 1992 and 2002, the number of female college graduates 
          in the United States has increased from 15.9 million to 23.6 
          million. Women account for 47 percent of all employed persons 
          and are entering the American workforce in record numbers. In 
          the last 10 years, their ranks have increased by 8.7 million. 
          Furthermore, women-owned small businesses are growing twice as 
          fast as all other U.S. firms, employing 7 million Americans 
          and contributing to the vitality of our economy. To build on 
          these successes, my Administration will continue our work to 
          promote policies that advance the aspirations, hopes, and 
          dreams of every American.
          This month, as we celebrate remarkable women in our Nation's 
          past, I encourage all citizens to recognize the countless 
          American women whose efforts continue to enhance the economic, 
          social, and cultural life of our great Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim March 2003 as Women's History Month. I call upon all 
          the people of the United States to observe this month with 
          appropriate ceremonies and activities and to remember 
          throughout the year the many contributions of American women.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7652 of February 28, 2003

Save Your Vision Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Each year, the number of Americans who suffer from vision loss 
          increases, yet half of all blindness can be prevented through 
          early detection and treatment. During Save Your Vision Week, 
          we renew our commitment to protecting eyesight by promoting 
          healthy eye care and by encouraging Americans to receive 
          routine vision screenings and dilated eye exams.
          Our sense of sight affects how we work, communicate, and 
          learn. All Americans must be aware of the risk of vision loss 
          and take steps to preserve and protect their eyesight, 
          beginning with getting regular eye exams, using the 
          appropriate protective eyewear, and maintaining a healthy 
          lifestyle. These small steps can make a big difference. When 
          Americans take responsibility for improving their health, our 
          whole society benefits.
          Healthy vision is especially critical to our children's 
          ability to receive a good education and establish a strong 
          foundation in life. According to the American Optometric 
          Association, 80 percent of learning depends on vision, yet 86 
          percent of children entering school have not had a thorough 
          eye examination. Due to hereditary and prenatal factors, from 
          a very early age, many children are at high risk for 
          potentially severe eye diseases, including retinopathy of 
          prematurity (ROP), amblyopia, and congenital glaucoma. One in 
          four kids will develop myopia as teenagers. Children need 
          regular eye care from birth to prevent and treat conditions 
          that lead to visual impairment and blindness. Parents play a 
          key role in obtaining eye care for their children and must be 
          knowledgeable about the potential threats to a child's 
          eyesight. For the future of our Nation, it is vital that we 
          care for the visual health and well-being of America's 
          children so they are able to reach their full potential.
          As part of my HealthierUS Initiative and my Administration's 
          ongoing commitment to helping the American people live 
          healthier lives, I encourage all Americans to get preventative 
          health screenings. These screenings may tell you if you are 
          prone to developing certain diseases, can help protect your 
          vision, and could even save your life. I particularly urge 
          parents to ask their children's doctors about vision 
          screenings and eye exams, which can help ensure eye diseases 
          and conditions are detected and treated early, when treatment 
          is most effective. Through education about healthy vision and 
          promotion of good eye care, we help protect the eyesight of 
          countless people across our Nation.
          The Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, 
          as amended (77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and 
          requested the President to proclaim the first week in March of 
          each year as ``Save Your Vision Week.'' During this week, I 
          encourage all Americans to learn more about ways to prevent 
          eye problems and to help others maintain the precious gift of 
          sight.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim March 2 through March 8, 
          2003, as Save Your Vision Week. I urge all Americans to make 
          eye care and eye safety

[[Page 37]]

          an important part of their lives and to include dilated eye 
          examinations in their regular health maintenance programs. I 
          invite eye care professionals, teachers, the media, and all 
          public and private organizations dedicated to preserving 
          eyesight to join in activities that will raise awareness of 
          measures all Americans can take to protect and sustain our 
          vision.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7653 of March 14, 2003

National Poison Prevention Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          More than 40 years ago, President John F. Kennedy signed into 
          law National Poison Prevention Week. The annual observance of 
          this week continues to help American families learn how to 
          protect their children from accidental poisonings.
          Every year more than one million children under 5 years of age 
          are exposed to poisonous household chemicals and medicines, 
          and an estimated 30 children die as a result of these 
          accidental poisonings. Almost every child poisoning could be 
          prevented. The death of even one child from poisoning is too 
          many and for this reason, Poison Prevention Week Council 
          members representing 37 national organizations coordinate 
          events each year to raise awareness of childhood poisonings 
          and to encourage preventative steps that all Americans can 
          take to protect the lives of our children.
          The theme of this year's National Poison Prevention Week, 
          ``Children Act Fast . . . So Do Poisons!'' reminds parents 
          that they always must be watchful when household chemicals or 
          drugs are stored and used. Many incidents occur when adults 
          are using a product and are distracted for only a brief time. 
          Unfortunately, it only takes a moment for a small child to 
          grab and swallow something that could be poisonous. To guard 
          against these accidents, we must keep medicines and household 
          chemicals locked up, out of sight and reach of young children 
          at all times. The Consumer Product Safety Commission requires 
          child-resistant packaging for certain toxic medicines and 
          chemicals, but it is vital we recognize that the packaging is 
          not ``child-proof,'' and must be monitored with great care.
          When poisoning is suspected, individuals should immediately 
          call the national toll-free number, 1	800	222	1222 to speak to 
          the nearest poison control center. This telephone number and 
          local poison control centers are available 24 hours a day, 7 
          days a week, and can provide life-saving emergency advice. 
          Regional Poison Control Centers in the United States provide 
          information on recommended treatment for the ingestion of 
          household products and medicines, and parents and those 
          responsible for taking care of children are encouraged to keep 
          the national toll-free number on their

[[Page 38]]

          telephones. In cases of an emergency, callers should remain 
          calm and provide the Poison Control Center expert with 
          essential information about the victim's age, weight, existing 
          health conditions, and details about the substance that was 
          inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed by the victim. Through our 
          vigilance, we can work together to help stop child poisonings 
          and give every child an opportunity for a bright future.
          To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of 
          accidental poisonings and to take more preventive measures, 
          the Congress, by joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, 
          as amended (75 Stat. 681), has authorized and requested the 
          President to issue a proclamation designating the third week 
          of March each year as ``National Poison Prevention Week.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim March 16 through 22, 
          2003, as National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all 
          Americans to observe this week by participating in appropriate 
          ceremonies and activities and by learning how to prevent 
          poisonings among children.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          fourteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7654 of March 18, 2003

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          After nearly 400 years of rule by the Ottomans, Greece 
          declared its independence on March 25, 1821. Long before that, 
          ancient Athenians created a Greek culture that valued human 
          liberty and dignity, and modern Greeks have demonstrated that 
          preserving freedom is a powerful motivating force. Today, on 
          Greek Independence Day, we recognize the ancient Greek 
          influence in framing our own Constitution and celebrate the 
          Greek-American heritage that continues to strengthen our 
          communities and enrich our society.
          Bound by history, mutual respect, and common ideals, America 
          and Greece have been firm allies in the great struggles for 
          liberty. Our countries fought together in every major 
          twentieth-century war, and today, we remain united in the war 
          against terror that threatens the future of every nation. We 
          are working together to achieve peace and prosperity in the 
          Balkans and southeastern Mediterranean. As the current 
          president of the European Union, Greece is also playing a 
          critical role in our efforts to confront many other global 
          problems that affect our nations and our world.
          Our commitment to the friendship between our two nations has 
          grown from strong bonds of tradition and shared fundamental 
          values. On Greek Independence Day, I encourage all Americans 
          to recognize the countless

[[Page 39]]

          contributions Greek Americans have made to our country. 
          Embodying the independence and creativity that have made our 
          country strong, their proud history is a source of inspiration 
          for our Nation and our world.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim March 25, 2003, as Greek Independence Day: A National 
          Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. I call 
          upon all the people of the United States to observe this day 
          with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          eighteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America

Proclamation 7655 of March 24, 2003

Cancer Control Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Millions of Americans are winning the fight against cancer, 
          but much work remains. More than 3,500 Americans are diagnosed 
          with cancer each day, and more than 45,000 will die from the 
          disease this month. Yet, experts believe that half of all 
          cancer deaths are preventable. With exercise, nutrition, and 
          healthy behavior, we can help prevent this deadly disease and 
          save lives. During Cancer Control Month, we renew our 
          commitment to over coming cancer by learning more about its 
          prevention and early detection.
          To protect against disease, Americans can make smart choices 
          that will lead to longer, healthier lives. A critical step 
          that Americans can take to improve their health and reduce the 
          risk of cancer is to avoid the use of tobacco. Also, avoiding 
          excessive drinking and sun exposure can help guard against 
          cancer and help ensure better health.
          Improvements in diet and fitness can help prevent many serious 
          health problems. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables and 
          regular physical activity help protect us from illness and can 
          add years to our lives. Research suggests that we can decrease 
          the number of cancer deaths in America by one-third simply by 
          changing our diets and getting more exercise.
          Preventative health screening is vital to early detection and 
          treatment of cancer. Regular screening can save lives and 
          enhances the well-being of our Nation. Screening can detect 
          many forms of cancer at earlier, less dangerous stages, 
          allowing patients to seek treatment and defeat the cancer 
          before it spreads. I urge all Americans to talk to their 
          doctors about when to start preventative screening and how 
          often to schedule appointments.
          Our Nation's investment in cancer prevention and research is 
          making a difference, and recent medical discoveries offer hope 
          to many Americans. The

[[Page 40]]

          National Cancer Institute (NCI) is currently sponsoring more 
          than 60 clinical trials on cancer prevention and screening. 
          One major clinical trial for men and women at risk for lung 
          cancer began this year, and is investigating the most 
          effective method of detecting lung cancer in order to reduce 
          deaths from this devastating disease.
          As part of my HealthierUS Initiative and my Administration's 
          ongoing commitment to helping the American people live 
          healthier lives, I encourage all Americans to eat right, get 
          more exercise, and take advantage of preventative screening. 
          To learn more about ways to prevent cancer, you can talk to 
          your doctor or contact the NCI's Cancer Information Service at 
          1	800	4	CANCER or visit its Internet address at http://
          www.cancer.gov. Through healthy lifestyles, a better 
          understanding of this disease, and new technology, I believe 
          we will achieve a victory over cancer.
          In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint 
          resolution (52 Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103) as amended, 
          requesting the President to issue an annual proclamation 
          declaring April as ``Cancer Control Month.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim April 2003 as Cancer 
          Control Month. I encourage concerned citizens, government 
          agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and 
          other interested groups to join in activities that will 
          increase awareness of measures all Americans can take to 
          prevent and control cancer.

Proclamation 7656 of March 26, 2003

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Our Nation has an important responsibility to create a caring 
          environment in which our children can flourish and reach their 
          full potential. As we observe the 20th anniversary of National 
          Child Abuse Prevention Month, we recognize the significant 
          progress we have made to increase the safety and security of 
          our children. We also renew our commitment to protecting our 
          most vulnerable citizens from harm. Child abuse and neglect 
          are national tragedies, and we must work together to eradicate 
          them.
          Every day, thousands of children are mistreated by their 
          parents, guardians, relatives, or caregivers. On average, 
          three children a day die as a result of abuse and neglect, and 
          countless others remain silent, their pain unnoticed and 
          unreported. These children face challenges that no child 
          deserves, and young people who have experienced abuse may grow 
          into adults who are self-destructive and damaging to our 
          communities. To help these children become healthy and happy 
          adults, parents and caregivers must provide

[[Page 41]]

          them with love, security, emotional support, and a strong 
          connection to their extended families and communities.
          To help ensure the safety and well-being of our children, my 
          Administration is committed to supporting and strengthening 
          families. In the last year, we have worked with faith-based 
          and community organizations to promote healthy marriages, 
          responsible fatherhood, and partnerships that seek to prevent 
          child abuse and neglect. We also worked with the Congress to 
          reauthorize the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program. 
          This year, we are asking the Congress to fully fund this 
          program at $505 million, an increase of more than 65 percent. 
          In addition, we are working with the Congress to reauthorize 
          the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. This important 
          legislation will provide funding to States for child abuse 
          prevention activities and other vital programs.
          Every child is a blessing. Through the cooperation of Federal, 
          State, and local governments, faith-based and community 
          organizations, schools, law enforcement, and health and human 
          service agencies, we can develop and enhance successful 
          prevention strategies that protect our young people. In 
          addition, we must continue to recognize the spirit of 
          compassion in individuals and community groups across our 
          Nation that offer care, guidance, and support for young 
          people, parents, and caregivers. By working together, we can 
          put hope in our children's hearts and ensure healthy and safe 
          lives for all our children.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 2003 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. 
          I encourage all Americans to join together to support strong 
          families, protect our children from abuse, neglect, and 
          maltreatment, and make our Nation a more promising place for 
          all.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-

          section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
          (title I of Public Law 106	200) (AGOA), authorizes the 
          President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the 
          AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          country'' if

[[Page 42]]

          the President determines that the country meets the 
          eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA 
          (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set 
          forth in section 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
          2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to 
          designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an 
          ``eligible sub-Saharan African country'' if the President 
          determines that the country meets certain eligibility 
          requirements.
          3. Section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(B)) 
          provides special rules for certain apparel articles imported 
          from ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          countries.''
          4. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) 
          of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the Republic of The 
          Gambia (The Gambia) meets the eligibility requirements set 
          forth or referenced therein, and I have decided to designate 
          The Gambia as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and as a 
          beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
          5. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA, I have determined that 
          the Democratic Republic of Congo (DROC) meets the eligibility 
          criteria set forth therein, and I have decided to designate 
          DROC as an eligible sub-Saharan African country.
          6. I have further decided to authorize the United States Trade 
          Representative (USTR) to exercise the authority provided to 
          the President under section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act with 
          respect to DROC. The USTR shall announce any such exercise of 
          authority in a notice published in the Federal Register.
          7. The Gambia satisfies the criterion for treatment as a 
          ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country'' 
          under section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA. DROC, if it is 
          designated as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, would 
          also satisfy the criterion for treatment as a ``lesser 
          developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country'' under 
          section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA.
          8. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
          President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
          United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions 
          of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and 
          actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
          continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
          restriction.
          9. With respect to any designation of DROC as a beneficiary 
          sub-Saharan African country, I have decided to authorize the 
          USTR to exercise the authority provided to the President under 
          section 604 of the 1974 Act to embody modifications and 
          technical or conforming changes in the HTS.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, 
          including sections 506A and 604 of the 1974 Act and section 
          104 of the AGOA, do proclaim that:
          (1) The Gambia is designated as an eligible sub-Saharan 
          African country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          country.
          (2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general 
          note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical 
          sequence in the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          countries ``Republic of The Gambia.''

[[Page 43]]

          (3) DROC is designated as an eligible sub-Saharan African 
          country.
          (4) The USTR is authorized to exercise the authority provided 
          to the President under section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act with 
          respect to DROC. The USTR shall announce any such exercise of 
          authority in a notice published in the Federal Register. To 
          implement any designation of DROC as a beneficiary sub-Saharan 
          African country, the USTR is authorized to exercise the 
          authority provided to the President under section 604 of the 
          1974 Act to embody modifications and technical or conforming 
          changes in the HTS.
          (5) For purposes of section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA, The 
          Gambia is a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          country. If it is designated as a beneficiary sub-Saharan 
          African country, DROC would also be a lesser developed 
          beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of 
          section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA.
          (6) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive 
          Orders that are inconsistent with this proclamation are 
          superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
          (7) The modification to the HTS made by this proclamation 
          shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or 
          withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date 
          of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          eighth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7658 of April 1, 2003

National Donate Life Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Advances in medical research and technology are helping our 
          citizens to live longer and better lives. An important aspect 
          of these improvements is transplant technology. Today, up to 
          50 lives can be saved or enhanced by just one organ and tissue 
          donor. During National Donate Life Month, we honor living and 
          deceased donors and their families across our Nation who have 
          renewed the lives of others, and we call upon more Americans 
          to follow their example.
          Through our Nation's organ and tissue donor programs, 
          thousands of Americans have given the gift of life. In 2002, 
          24,851 organ transplants and 32,744 corneal transplants were 
          performed in the United States. In addition, the National Bone 
          Marrow Donor Registry facilitated an average of 173 
          transplants each month. These donors' spirit of giving 
          reflects the compassion of our great Nation.

[[Page 44]]

          Unfortunately, the current rate of donation is inadequate to 
          meet the growing needs of our fellow Americans. Nearly 81,000 
          of our citizens are on the national organ transplant waiting 
          list. Each day, an average of 68 of these individuals receive 
          an organ transplant, yet another 17 on the waiting list die. 
          As a Nation, we must strive to meet the needs of all Americans 
          awaiting such donations.
          Through the ``Gift of Life Donation Initiative,'' my 
          Administration is working to educate our Nation about the 
          importance of becoming a donor. During National Donate Life 
          Month, more than 6,000 partners, including Federal agencies, 
          State governments, private industries, unions, fraternal 
          organizations, and associations have committed to promoting 
          organ and tissue donation awareness. As a result, millions of 
          Americans will learn about the many ways they can help those 
          in need and save lives.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 2003 as National Donate Life Month. I call upon 
          our citizens to sign an organ and tissue donor card and to be 
          screened for bone marrow donation. I also urge healthcare 
          professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, and 
          private organizations to help raise awareness of the important 
          need for organ and tissue donors in communities throughout our 
          Nation.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this First day 
          of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7659 of April 4, 2003

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Crime brings trauma, pain, and insecurity into the lives of 
          too many Americans each year. As we work to reduce crime and 
          protect the rights of the accused, we must take equal care to 
          protect the rights of their victims. During National Crime 
          Victims' Rights Week, we remember those who have suffered as a 
          result of crime and honor those who have helped these victims.
          Americans suffered over 24 million crimes in 2001, 5.7 million 
          of which involved violence. While we have improved policies 
          and our justice system has treated victims with greater 
          respect in recent years, we must continue our work to ensure 
          the full rights of all crime victims and better protect our 
          citizens. My Administration believes that victims of violent 
          crime have important rights that deserve protection in our 
          Constitution, and to guarantee these rights, I strongly 
          support the passage of the bipartisan Crime Victims' Rights 
          Amendment. This amendment will provide victims of violent 
          crime the right to reasonable and timely notice of any public 
          proceedings involving the crime or release of the perpetrator, 
          and the right to

[[Page 45]]

          be heard at public proceedings regarding the criminal's 
          sentence or potential release. It will also assure that such 
          victims receive timely notice of any escape of their attacker. 
          Under this amendment, decision makers will duly consider the 
          victim's safety and payment of restitution from the offender 
          to the victim. This important amendment will strike the right 
          balance in protecting individual rights and ensuring fairness 
          and equity in our criminal justice system.
          Across our Nation, victims' rights groups work on behalf of 
          victims every day. Through care and compassion, these groups 
          and individuals are bringing hope and comfort to their 
          neighbors in need. Domestic violence shelters, support groups 
          for families of homicide victims, rape crisis centers, and 
          other organizations in our cities and communities offer vital 
          assistance to individuals who have been affected by crime. In 
          times of such crises, counselors, hotline operators, clergy, 
          doctors, nurses, law enforcement, and countless others also 
          help their fellow Americans cope with their pain and 
          suffering.
          As a Nation, we must continue to seek justice on behalf of all 
          people who have been victimized by crime. The heroes in these 
          efforts are the individuals and organizations who work to 
          provide valuable support and assistance to those who have 
          suffered from crime. This week allows us to recognize these 
          heroes and renew our commitment to fulfilling the promise of 
          our Nation of justice for all.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 6 through April 12, 2003, as National Crime 
          Victims' Rights Week. I encourage every community to embrace 
          the cause of victims' rights and to advance it in all sectors 
          of our society.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth 
          day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and

Proclamation 7660 of April 8, 2003

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          America's former prisoners of war (POWs) are national heroes 
          whose service to our country will never be forgotten. These 
          brave men and women who fought for America and endured 
          cruelties and deprivation as prisoners of war helped to 
          protect our Nation, liberated millions of people from the 
          threats of tyranny and terror, and advanced the cause of 
          freedom worldwide.
          This year, our Nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of the 
          signing of the armistice to end armed conflict in the Korean 
          War. We remember Operation Little Switch, conducted April 
          through May 1953, that freed 149

[[Page 46]]

          American POWs, and Operation Big Switch, conducted August 
          through September 1953, which returned 3,597 Americans to our 
          country. Finally, Operation Glory, conducted July through 
          November 1954, was responsible for the return of the remains 
          of 2,944 Americans from North Korea. During this observance, 
          we also recognize and honor the more than 8,100 Americans 
          still unaccounted for from the Korean War.
          This year also marks the 30th anniversary of Operation 
          Homecoming, in which 591 American POWs from Vietnam were 
          returned. We also recognize and honor those Americans still 
          unaccounted for from the Vietnam War.
          All of these individuals are to be honored for their strength 
          of character and for the difficulties they and their families 
          endured. From World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam, to 
          the 1991 Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and other 
          conflicts, our service men and women have sacrificed much to 
          secure freedom, defend the ideals of our Nation, and free the 
          oppressed. By answering the call of duty and risking their 
          lives to protect others, these proud patriots continue to 
          inspire us today as we work with our allies to extend peace, 
          liberty, and opportunity to people around the world.
          As we honor our former POWs, we are reminded of our current 
          POWs, captured in Operation Iraqi Freedom. We will work to 
          secure their freedom, and we pray for their speedy and safe 
          return. These brave men and women in uniform follow in the 
          footsteps of these former POWs who placed country above self 
          to advance peace in a troubled world.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 9, 2003, as National Former Prisoner of War 
          Recognition Day. I call upon all the people of the United 
          States to join me in remembering former American prisoners of 
          war by honoring the memory of their sacrifices and in praying 
          for the safe return of our POWs. I also call upon Federal, 
          State, and local government officials and private 
          organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies 
          and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth 
          day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and

Proclamation 7661 of April 9, 2003

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Drugs destroy the hopes, dreams, and the health of our 
          children, and we must continue to work to reduce drug use 
          among America's young people. Today we honor Drug Abuse 
          Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.), the most widely recognized 
          substance abuse and violence prevention curriculum in America. 
          As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of this important 
          program,

[[Page 47]]

          we recognize D.A.R.E.'s proud record of helping millions of 
          young people lead productive, drug-free, and violence-free 
          lives, and reaffirm our commitment to end illegal drug use 
          among our youth.
          D.A.R.E. was founded in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police 
          Department (LAPD), which faced an overwhelming drug use 
          problem among juveniles and saw the need for a program to 
          educate children and young adults about the destructive 
          realities of substance abuse. Teaming with the Los Angeles 
          Unified School District, the LAPD sent specially trained 
          police officers into classrooms to teach middle school 
          students how to resist peer pressure and make positive 
          decisions. Since that beginning 20 years ago, D.A.R.E. has 
          grown to reach 36 million students in more than 300,000 
          classrooms in the United States and around the world. Today, 
          D.A.R.E. programs are taught in 80 percent of our Nation's 
          school districts.
          D.A.R.E.'s in-school curriculum focuses on giving children 
          practical skills to avoid becoming involved in drugs, gangs, 
          and violence. D.A.R.E. officers serve as supportive role 
          models and encourage young people to develop healthy self-
          esteem. D.A.R.E. also helps young people in the critical 
          after-school hours through D.A.R.E. P.L.U.S. (Play and Learn 
          Under Supervision), a follow-up program that serves as a safe 
          and fun alternative to the local streets. D.A.R.E. P.L.U.S. is 
          designed to encourage middle school students to start taking 
          responsibility for their actions and to engage in activities 
          other than drug use.
          One of the core principles of my National Drug Control 
          Strategy is to stop drug use before it starts, and D.A.R.E. 
          and D.A.R.E. P.L.U.S. play an important role in my community-
          based approach. Through these programs, parents, educators, 
          law enforcement officials, and other caring citizens are 
          joining together in a collaborative fight against illegal 
          drugs. However, we have more to do to reduce illegal drug use 
          among America's youth. The most effective way to reduce the 
          supply of drugs is to reduce the demand, and I am confident 
          that we can help accomplish this goal through a focus on 
          effective, family-centered education and prevention.
          Toward this end, I have proposed the creation of a Parents 
          Drug Corps to educate and train parents to lead the effort in 
          preventing drug use among children and teens. In addition, I 
          have asked the Congress to support millions of parents and 
          concerned citizens in communities nationwide by doubling 
          funding for the Drug-Free Communities Support Program. These 
          new efforts will complement our ongoing work to surround our 
          most vulnerable children with caring adults who can offer 
          support, guidance, and encouragement.
          As we honor the dedicated individuals whose extraordinary 
          efforts make D.A.R.E. work, we resolve to continue to help 
          young people avoid the dangers of drug use and violence. By 
          helping to ensure that all our children are educated and 
          supported by positive and caring role models, we contribute to 
          a promising future that offers hope and opportunity for all.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 10, 2003, as National D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon 
          all the people of the United States, particularly our youth, 
          parents, and educators, to observe this day by joining the 
          fight against drugs in our communities. I also encourage our 
          citizens to express

[[Page 48]]

          appreciation for the law enforcement officers, volunteers, and 
          others who work to help young people avoid the dangers of drug 
          use.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day 
          of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two

          renew our commitment to providing quality education and to 
          teaching our children the values that prepare them for lives 
          as good neighbors and citizens.
          Education has always been one of our Nation's top priorities. 
          We place great reliance and confidence in our public education 
          system, recognizing that it is one of the most important 
          institutions of our free society. By helping our young 
          citizens learn and develop skills, education has spurred our 
          progress and prosperity, driven our Nation's economy, and 
          enriched our culture.
          Over the last 2 years, my Administration has taken significant 
          action to transform public education in America. In one of the 
          most comprehensive reforms ever passed, the No Child Left 
          Behind Act of 2001 strengthened our school systems and 
          affirmed our fundamental belief in the promise of every child. 
          By raising expectations and insisting on results, we can make 
          a difference in the lives of all our children.
          As part of our commitment to our children's future, we must 
          also teach young Americans to live lives of integrity and 
          purpose, and to realize the importance of loving others and 
          contributing to their communities. These values are first 
          learned within the family, but all of our citizens, and 
          especially our teachers, can support parents in the character 
          education of our children. By guiding young people to 
          understand universal values such as tolerance, honesty, 
          commitment to family, service to others, and respect for the 
          dignity of every life, our schools and communities can help 
          our Nation fulfill its great potential.
          For the past 19 years, on the anniversary of his birth, we 
          have recognized the contributions of the Rabbi Menachem Mendel 
          Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe who was instrumental in 
          establishing numerous educational, social, and rehabilitative 
          institutions. The Rebbe believed that education is critical in 
          cultivating the moral character of students. He lived what he 
          said: ``A single good deed on your part could transform the 
          world.''
          Today in the United States, there is a growing momentum of 
          acts of kindness. Across our country, millions of Americans 
          are helping to reinforce a

[[Page 49]]

          culture of service, citizenship, and responsibility, and are 
          applying the compassion of America to our biggest problems and 
          deepest wounds. To build on these successes, we must instill 
          these values in our next generation of leaders. Amidst a world 
          of challenges, we can equip our children to carry our Nation 
          into a future of promise and possibility for all.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 13, 2003, as Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. 
          I call upon all Americans to invest in our Nation's future by 
          helping our children understand the importance of character 
          and provide them the knowledge and values necessary to 
          succeed.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day 
          of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Our Nation takes great pride in the unity of the Pan American 
          community. We enjoy strong bonds of friendship with our 
          neighbors throughout the Western Hemisphere, and the almost 33 
          million citizens of Latin American and Caribbean descent who 
          are a part of the rich cultural diversity of our country. 
          Their contributions have enriched our Nation. In the Western 
          Hemisphere, we share common commitments to overcoming poverty, 
          achieving peace and prosperity for all, and providing safety 
          in our hemisphere. As we observe Pan American Day and Pan 
          American Week, we renew our dedication to working with the Pan 
          American community of nations to protect democracy, promote 
          economic growth, and provide for the defense and security of 
          all our citizens.
          The governments of the region continue to make important 
          progress in advancing democracy, as demonstrated by the free, 
          fair, and transparent elections that took place throughout the 
          region this past year. The United States joins with our 
          neighbors in the hemisphere in congratulating the citizens and 
          governments of those nations on their achievements, and my 
          Administration remains dedicated to working with the 
          democratically elected governments of the Americas to defend 
          freedoms whenever and wherever they are threatened. The 
          historic Inter-American Democratic Charter, adopted on 
          September 11, 2001, continues to guide efforts across the 
          region to protect human rights and political freedoms, combat 
          corruption, promote good governance, and strengthen democratic 
          institutions.
          The countries of our hemisphere have made great strides in 
          opening their economies in recent decades, and we must 
          continue to work towards open exchanges of ideas and goods 
          throughout Pan America. To promote these

[[Page 50]]

          goals, we must welcome the expansion of economic integration 
          and renew our dedication to creating a Free Trade Area of the 
          Americas.
          Ensuring hemispheric security remains one of our most 
          important common objectives. Today and in the future, we will 
          continue our efforts to safeguard our citizens and to ensure 
          that individuals throughout our hemisphere enjoy the full 
          benefits of freedom. By working together, we can achieve the 
          Pan American goals of protecting democracy and human rights, 
          defeating tyranny, and overcoming poverty and lawlessness.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 14, 2003, as Pan American Day, and April 13 
          through April 19, 2003, as Pan American Week. I encourage the 
          Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth 
          of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the 
          flag of the United States of America to honor these 
          observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh 
          day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and

Proclamation 7664 of April 15, 2003

National Fair Housing Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          The Fair Housing Act was signed on April 11, 1968, just one 
          week after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
          This landmark bill, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 
          1968, resulted from the hard work and leadership of Dr. King 
          and others in the civil rights movement and was an important 
          step toward confronting discrimination against minorities in 
          housing. As we celebrate the 35th anniversary of this historic 
          legislation, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that all 
          Americans have equal access to housing.
          The Fair Housing Act of 1968 has helped open doors of 
          opportunity for countless families. Since its passage, America 
          has made significant progress in achieving equal housing 
          access for all individuals.
          Despite this progress, more work remains in our struggle to 
          achieve equality and racial justice. Prejudice and 
          discriminatory practices in housing still exist in America. A 
          recent lending study showed that minorities continue to 
          receive less information, less assistance, and less favorable 
          terms and conditions than non-minorities while applying for 
          home loans. These practices are wrong. As a Nation, and as 
          individuals, we must be vigilant in responding to 
          discrimination wherever we find it and ensuring that minority 
          families have access to housing. With my minority 
          homeownership initiative and its partnership with the private 
          sector, I have set a goal to increase the number of minority 
          homeowners by 5.5 million by 2010.

[[Page 51]]

          All Americans should know their housing rights, and the 
          Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is working 
          to increase public awareness of fair housing laws, including 
          those combating discrimination in mortgage lending. The 2004 
          budget request for HUD includes $50 million for fair housing_a 
          9 percent increase over 2003 funding_with a substantial 
          portion specifically allocated for increased education and 
          outreach efforts. The Department is also collaborating with 
          the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on a financial 
          education program in minority neighborhoods. In addition, the 
          HUD, Education, and the Treasury Departments are advancing 
          initiatives to educate families about homeownership through 
          counseling programs and financial literacy efforts.
          We are also vigilantly enforcing fair housing laws, showing no 
          tolerance for those who discriminate. The Office of Fair 
          Housing and Equal Opportunity at HUD is working with private 
          industry and fair housing and community advocates to promote 
          voluntary compliance and to ensure that consumers are treated 
          in a lawful, respectful manner. When warranted, the Department 
          of Justice takes legal action to protect our citizens from 
          discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or 
          national origin.
          Finally, we are working to increase the supply of accessible 
          housing for citizens with disabilities. HUD continues to 
          aggressively enforce the law on behalf of people with 
          disabilities, and the Department is working cooperatively with 
          builders, architects, and others to provide technical 
          assistance to help construct more handicapped-accessible 
          housing.
          Fair Housing Month provides an opportunity to place special 
          emphasis on our goal to increase homeownership throughout our 
          country. Together, we can advance toward a future where all 
          our citizens have access to a key element of the American 
          Dream_homeownership.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 2003 as National Fair Housing Month. I call 
          upon the people of the United States to learn more about their 
          rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act and the 
          roles they can individually and collectively play to combat 
          housing discrimination.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth 
          day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7665 of April 18, 2003

National Park Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          America is a land of majestic beauty, and we are blessed with 
          immeasurable natural wealth. Americans are united in the 
          belief that we must preserve this treasured heritage and 
          conserve these natural resources for the benefit and enjoyment 
          of the American people.
          As a Nation, we can be proud of our diverse parklands, ranging 
          from the rugged wilderness of snow-capped mountains, thick 
          forests, sweeping desert sands, and remote canyons to national 
          symbols such as the Statue of Liberty and the Lincoln 
          Memorial. Our National Park Service has a long and important 
          history. In 1864, the Federal Government ensured a grand 
          natural landscape for generations to come when it designated 
          Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias to be 
          ``held for public use, resort, and recreation . . . 
          inalienable for all time.'' Eight years later in 1872, the 
          Congress created the first national park in the Yellowstone 
          region of the Territories of Montana and Wyoming. Finally, in 
          1916, the National Park Service was established to efficiently 
          administer our growing number of parks, which today includes 
          388 national parks on more than 84 million acres of public 
          lands. These lands continue to be cherished by all our 
          citizens.
          The full and safe enjoyment of our national parks depends on 
          dedicated National Park Service employees and thousands of 
          people who volunteer their time to conserve these sites. This 
          year's theme for National Park Week, ``Celebrating 
          Volunteers,'' recognizes their valuable contributions to 
          conserving and maintaining our natural, cultural, and 
          historical heritage.
          Across the country, my Administration is promoting volunteer 
          service, encouraging public-private partnerships, and 
          advocating community-based interest in our national parks. We 
          are committed to ensuring that our land is conserved, our air 
          is clean, our water is pure, and our parks are open and 
          accessible to all Americans. Recently, my Administration re-
          launched Take Pride in America, a national partnership that 
          engages volunteers from every corner of America to enhance our 
          parks and other public lands. As part of the USA Freedom Corps 
          initiative, Take Pride in America will encourage more 
          Americans to take part in volunteer service opportunities 
          available on public lands.
          My Administration has also supported improvements in park 
          management and is working to reduce the park maintenance 
          backlog. My fiscal year 2004 budget includes over $1 billion 
          to reduce the maintenance backlog, an increase of $180 million 
          over last year's request, along with $76 million, a $9 million 
          increase over last year's request, for the National Park 
          Service Natural Resource Challenge to monitor ``vital signs'' 
          of conditions in our parks. This initiative will help conserve 
          native species and habitats, maintain our natural resources, 
          eradicate invasive species, and provide the public with 
          information about resources in our parks. In addition, my 
          Administration has developed the website www.recreation.gov, 
          which is a user-

[[Page 53]]

          friendly way to obtain information about recreational 
          opportunities in the national parks and other public 
          recreation sites.
          As we observe National Park Week, I encourage all citizens to 
          explore our national parks and to commit to the conservation 
          and stewardship of these timeless treasures. By working 
          together, we can ensure that these special places thrive for 
          generations to come.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 21 through April 27, 2003, as National Park 
          Week. I call upon the people of the United States to join me 
          in recognizing the importance of our national parks and to 
          learn more about these areas of beauty, their historical 
          significance, and the many ways citizens can volunteer to help 
          preserve these precious resources.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          eighteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7666 of April 25, 2003

National Charter Schools Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Charter schools provide many children with a first-class 
          education, and they have gained national recognition for their 
          accountability standards, innovative programs, and success 
          with young people. The high expectations they set and the 
          opportunities for development they create help students 
          attending charter schools realize their potential and achieve 
          their dreams.
          Charter schools are held to the same standards, including 
          curriculum standards, as traditional schools, and are also 
          accountable to students, parents, and community leaders for 
          producing results and improving achievement. By defining 
          expected goals and offering options for children trapped in 
          low-performing schools, charter schools help improve the 
          overall quality of education in America.
          The success of charter schools is evident in the achievements 
          of the children who attend those schools and in the positive 
          response from the communities they serve. In little more than 
          a decade, 2,700 charter schools have opened in 36 States and 
          the District of Columbia, and nearly two-thirds of these 
          schools have waiting lists. Forty States and the District of 
          Columbia have enacted charter school laws, and this year four 
          additional States began considering charter school laws. To 
          help State and local districts provide parents with more 
          quality education alternatives, I have proposed increased 
          funding for charter schools so that more of our children can 
          receive the gift of a good education.

[[Page 54]]

          The accomplishments of charter schools prove that we can 
          improve our public education system by replacing low 
          expectations with a culture of achievement that rewards 
          success and does not tolerate failure. Over the last 2 years, 
          my Administration has taken steps to realize this vision by 
          supporting accountability for results, expanded parental 
          choice, increased local flexibility, and a focus on what 
          works. With the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, we continue 
          to build a stronger educational foundation for America's 
          children. States are now responsible for improving student 
          achievement in public schools by maintaining tough academic 
          standards and setting annual progress goals. The law further 
          requires regular testing to ensure all students are proficient 
          in reading and math and to help identify learning problems.
          My Administration is working to provide the resources schools 
          need to fund education reform and achieve these high 
          standards. We have increased funding for elementary and 
          secondary education by 36 percent in the last 2 years, and the 
          Federal Government will spend nearly $24 billion on these 
          programs this year. Through the new Reading First program, 
          over $500 million has been distributed to 29 States to assist 
          with reading programs that help ensure that our children will 
          know how to read by the third grade. Expansions of our charter 
          schools, and reforms in traditional public schools, are 
          helping build the mind and character of our future leaders.
          During National Charter Schools Week, we renew our commitment 
          to our children and their education. I urge every American to 
          visit a charter school and learn about its efforts to help 
          children in their community. Charter schools are just one of 
          many successful alternatives that ensure that no child is left 
          behind. By raising expectations and fostering hope, we can 
          help build a future of promise for our next generation of 
          Americans.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 27 through May 3, 2003, as National Charter 
          Schools Week. I commend the States with charter schools, and I 
          call on parents of charter school children to share their 
          success stories with others so that all Americans may 
          understand more about the important work of charter schools.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          fifth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

National Volunteer Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Volunteering is central to the American character and is a 
          fundamental expression of responsible citizenship. From our 
          Nation's earliest days, people

[[Page 55]]

          came together to do whatever was needed for the public good_
          from raising barns and providing mutual security to organizing 
          educational activities and caring for their neighbors. Though 
          our country has changed dramatically since its founding, the 
          need for service has not. During National Volunteer Week, we 
          recognize our proud legacy of volunteer service and resolve to 
          encourage more Americans to continue strengthening our country 
          by helping others.
          This is a time for all Americans to be active citizens, not 
          spectators. For that reason, I have created the USA Freedom 
          Corps to mobilize our citizens and provide opportunities for 
          individuals and organizations to contribute to important 
          causes. As part of this initiative, I have asked all Americans 
          to dedicate at least 4,000 hours over the rest of their lives 
          to serving their neighbors and their Nation. Since that call 
          to service, our citizens have responded with an outpouring of 
          kindness that is transforming our country, one heart and one 
          soul at a time. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
          more than 59 million Americans volunteered last year through 
          charitable organizations.
          These individuals served in a variety of ways_mentoring and 
          tutoring children, providing companionship to the elderly, 
          running community theaters and arts programs, cleaning 
          highways and parks, staffing essential community 
          organizations, and offering physical and spiritual aid to the 
          hungry and homeless. In addition, citizen volunteers have 
          contributed to the ongoing war on terror by helping families 
          and communities prevent, prepare for, and respond to 
          emergencies. Across our Nation, our citizens are recognizing 
          that everyone can do something to help and that serving those 
          in need benefits the volunteer also.
          My Administration has taken several steps to build on this 
          progress and continue the momentum created by these millions 
          of acts of service. Most recently, I formed the President's 
          Council on Service and Civic Participation, and charged them 
          with creating a nationwide recognition program called the 
          President's Volunteer Service Awards. These awards will be 
          given to individuals and organizations engaged in a variety of 
          volunteer services who have made a sustained commitment to 
          service over the course of 1 year, and enhance our ability to 
          pay tribute to volunteers and the impact their service has on 
          our communities and our country.
          National Volunteer Week offers each of us the opportunity to 
          recognize one of the true strengths of our Nation_the 
          compassionate spirit of our citizens. I urge all Americans to 
          continue to uphold this spirit and answer the call to service 
          to help ensure that all our citizens realize the promise of 
          America. Together, we can achieve a hopeful future for all.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim April 27 through May 3, 2003, as National Volunteer 
          Week. I call on all Americans to join together to celebrate 
          the invaluable work that volunteers perform every day across 
          our country, and to commit themselves to do more for their 
          neighbors in need through the many volunteer programs 
          available in their communities.

Proclamation 7668 of April 30, 2003

Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          America is strengthened by the rich cultural diversity of our 
          people, and we are blessed to be a Nation that welcomes 
          individuals of all races, religions, and cultural backgrounds. 
          The values and traditions of the Asian/Pacific-American 
          community_love of family, entrepreneurship, excellence in 
          education, and community service_have strengthened us as a 
          Nation. During Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, we 
          celebrate the contributions of these talented and hard-working 
          citizens and recognize their rich legacy of ingenuity, 
          perseverance, and achievement.
          Many Asian/Pacific immigrants came to America to discover the 
          promise of our Nation and to realize their dreams. Their 
          contributions were critical in establishing a robust economy. 
          Asian/Pacific Americans also worked tirelessly to build our 
          national railroad infrastructure, paving the way for our 
          western expansion and growth as a world leader. Generations of 
          Asian/Pacific Americans have proudly served our Nation with 
          honor and courage in wars and conflicts, including most 
          recently in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
          Freedom. Today, as in the past, their dedication and service 
          to advancing peace in a troubled world upholds the values that 
          make our country strong.
          Asian/Pacific Americans are also helping to shape America's 
          future. As entrepreneurs, artists, educators, public servants, 
          scientists, and explorers, they challenge the minds of our 
          next generation, expand commerce and innovation, probe the 
          frontiers of space, and search for cures for the world's 
          diseases. Our children are also inspired by the contributions 
          and sacrifices of dedicated individuals such as inventor An 
          Wang, experimental physicist Chien-Shiung Wu, Challenger 
          astronaut Ellison Onizuka, Columbia astronaut Kalpana Chawla, 
          and sculptor Isamu Noguchi.
          Since the earliest days of America, people from all cultures 
          have traveled to our Nation seeking the promise of freedom, 
          opportunity, and justice. As an integral part of our society, 
          Americans of Asian and Pacific heritage share in the pursuit 
          of this American Dream. I join with all Americans in 
          celebrating this rich and diverse culture, and I encourage 
          every citizen to recognize the role of Asian/Pacific Americans 
          in building and sustaining our Nation.
          To honor the achievements of Asian/Pacific Americans, the 
          Congress by Public Law 102	450 as amended, has designated the 
          month of May each year as ``Asian/Pacific American Heritage 
          Month.''

[[Page 57]]

          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim May 2003 as Asian/
          Pacific American Heritage Month. I call upon our citizens to 
          learn more about the history of Asian/Pacific Americans and 
          how they have contributed to the culture and heritage of our 
          Nation.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth 
          day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7669 of April 30, 2003

Older Americans Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Advances in medicine, public health, science, and technology 
          are keeping Americans healthier and adding years to our lives. 
          As our population of senior citizens continues to grow, our 
          Nation remains dedicated to fulfilling our promises to these 
          valuable members of our society. This year's observance of 
          Older Americans Month, ``What We Do Makes A Difference,'' 
          recognizes the important contributions of older Americans and 
          the network of services that support them. Older Americans 
          continue to work in a variety of jobs, from teachers, to 
          engineers, to business owners and entrepreneurs, and in so 
          doing bring invaluable experience and leadership skills. 
          Additionally, their wisdom, strength, and compassion reflect 
          the character of our great Nation. During this month, we honor 
          our seniors and thank them for the lessons they teach us and 
          the strong values they instill in families and communities 
          throughout our country.
          Serving as examples to others, throughout our Nation every 
          day, older Americans are engaging in acts of compassion. Over 
          a half million members of the Senior Corps are volunteering 
          their time and talents to help those in need. Retired doctors, 
          nurses, police, and firefighters are helping communities 
          prepare for emergencies, and countless other older Americans 
          are bringing comfort and care to their families and neighbors. 
          These individuals understand the importance of service, and 
          their efforts are helping to build a more welcoming society. 
          Many food banks, clothing distribution programs, and other 
          social service activities of faith-based and community 
          organizations could not operate without the senior Americans 
          who volunteer in these efforts.
          As these individuals continue to work on our behalf, our 
          Nation is working to fulfill our obligations to older 
          Americans by providing them with good health care and other 
          services to enhance their lives. My Administration is 
          coordinating with State and Area Agencies on Aging, and faith-
          based and community organizations to better provide essential 
          services, such as meals, nutrition, counseling, and health 
          screening, to our seniors. Seven million older Americans and 
          their families are currently being served by a large network 
          of Federal, State, tribal, local partnerships, and thousands 
          of volunteers. The services provided by these groups make it 
          easier for

[[Page 58]]

          older Americans to remain in their homes, communities, and the 
          workplace, which helps preserve their dignity and 
          independence.
          In addition, our Medicare system is our binding commitment as 
          a caring society. When Medicare was signed into law 38 years 
          ago, it was designed to bring the healing miracle of modern 
          medicine to our senior citizens. We must renew our commitment 
          to giving seniors access to the preventative medicines and new 
          drugs that are transforming health care in America. Medicare 
          must be available in a variety of forms, and older Americans 
          must have the opportunity to choose the healthcare plan that 
          best fits their needs. My Administration will continue its 
          efforts to improve programs that support older Americans and 
          to offer innovative options for long-term care.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim May 2003 as Older Americans Month. I commend our 
          senior citizens for their many contributions to our society. I 
          further commend the network of Federal, State, local, and 
          tribal organizations, service and healthcare providers, 
          caregivers, and millions of dedicated volunteers for their 
          daily efforts on behalf of our senior citizens. I encourage 
          all Americans to honor their elders, to find opportunities to 
          address their needs, and to work together to reinforce the 
          bonds that unite families and communities. I also call upon 
          all our citizens to publicly reaffirm our Nation's commitment 
          to older Americans this month, and throughout the year.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth 
          day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proc. 7670

Proclamation 7670 of April 30, 2003

Law Day, U.S.A., 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          America was founded on the ideals of liberty and equality for 
          all, and the Framers of the Constitution created three 
          branches of the national Government to uphold these 
          principles. The third branch, the Judicial, is responsible for 
          administering justice fairly and impartially. On Law Day, we 
          recognize the achievements of our Nation's legal system and 
          our independent Judiciary in sustaining the rights and 
          liberties we cherish.
          George Washington wrote, ``The administration of justice is 
          the firmest pillar of government.'' Our Judicial branch 
          upholds the rule of law in our society and strengthens our 
          democracy. Under the Constitution, judges are granted the 
          solemn responsibility of providing fair and impartial 
          resolution of criminal and civil disputes.

[[Page 59]]

          This year's Law Day theme, ``Independent Courts Protect Our 
          Liberties,'' focuses on one of the foundations of our 
          constitutional system: judicial independence, provided in the 
          Federal system by life tenure and an assured level of 
          compensation. In order to ensure equality for all citizens and 
          fairness in the judicial process, our judges must serve as 
          impartial arbiters who do not have a stake in their decisions 
          or seek to achieve a biased outcome or particular result in 
          the cases they oversee.
          Our constitutional system of separation of powers places 
          careful limits on the powers of judges and separates the 
          responsibilities of making laws and interpreting laws between 
          the Legislative and Judicial branches. Independent Federal 
          judges have the autonomy to make decisions and interpret the 
          law unfettered by outside influences. In this way, we are 
          assured that our laws will be interpreted justly and applied 
          with uniformity.
          Our Nation's judges must be men and women of exemplary 
          character, wisdom, experience, and good temperament, and have 
          a willingness to work hard. They must be jurists who will 
          honor the public office with which they are entrusted.
          This Law Day, we recognize the vital role of independent 
          judges in upholding justice in courts throughout our land, and 
          we resolve to continue to support and strengthen the Judicial 
          branch, thereby helping to preserve our rights and liberties.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87	20, as 
          amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2003, as Law Day, U.S.A. I 
          call upon all the people of the United States to observe this 
          day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call 
          upon Government officials to display the flag of the United 
          States in support of this national observance.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth 
          day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7671 of April 30, 2003

Loyalty Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          To be an American is not a matter of blood or birth. Our 
          citizens are bound by ideals that represent the hope of all 
          mankind: that all men are created equal, endowed with 
          unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
          happiness. On Loyalty Day, we reaffirm our allegiance to our 
          country and resolve to uphold the vision of our Forefathers.
          Our founding principles have endured, guiding our Nation 
          toward progress and prosperity and allowing the United States 
          to be a leader among nations of the world. Throughout our 
          history, honorable men and women have

[[Page 60]]

          demonstrated their loyalty to America by making remarkable 
          sacrifices to preserve and protect these values.
          Today, America's men and women in uniform are protecting our 
          Nation, defending the peace of the world, and advancing the 
          cause of liberty. The world has seen again the fine character 
          of our Nation through our military as they fought to protect 
          the innocent and liberate the oppressed in Operation Iraqi 
          Freedom. We are honored by the service of foreign nationals in 
          our Armed Services whose willingness to risk their lives for a 
          country they cannot yet call their own is proof of the loyalty 
          this country inspires. Their service and sacrifice are a 
          testament to their love for America, and our soldiers' honor 
          on and off the battlefield reaffirms our Nation's most deeply 
          held beliefs: that every life counts, and that all humans have 
          an unalienable right to live as free people.
          These values must be imparted to each new generation. Our 
          children need to know that our Nation is a force for good in 
          the world, extending hope and freedom to others. By learning 
          about America's history, achievements, ideas, and heroes, our 
          young citizens will come to understand even more why freedom 
          is worth protecting.
          Last September, I announced several initiatives that will help 
          improve students' knowledge of American history, increase 
          their civic involvement, and deepen their love for our great 
          country. The We the People initiative will encourage the 
          teaching of American history and civic education by providing 
          grants for curriculum development and training seminars. The 
          Our Documents initiative will use the Internet to bring 
          information about and the text of 100 of America's most 
          important documents from the National Archives to classrooms 
          and communities across the country. These initiatives are 
          important, for it is only when our children have an 
          understanding of our past that they will be able to lead the 
          future.
          This Loyalty Day, as we express allegiance to our Nation and 
          its founding ideals, we resolve to ensure that the blessings 
          of liberty endure and extend for generations to come.
          The Congress, by Public Law 85	529, as amended, has designated 
          May 1 of each year as ``Loyalty Day,'' and I ask all Americans 
          to join me in this day of celebration and in reaffirming our 
          allegiance to our Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2003, as Loyalty 
          Day. I call upon all the people of the United States to join 
          in support of this national observance. I also call upon 
          government officials to display the flag of the United States 
          on all government buildings on Loyalty Day.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth 
          day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two

National Day of Prayer, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          We are a Nation whose people turn to prayer in times of our 
          most heartfelt sorrow and our moments of greatest joy. On this 
          National Day of Prayer, first called for more than 225 years 
          ago by the Continental Congress, we come together to thank God 
          for our Nation's many blessings, to acknowledge our need for 
          His wisdom and grace, and to ask Him to continue to watch over 
          our country in the days ahead.
          America welcomes individuals of all backgrounds and religions, 
          and our citizens hold diverse beliefs. In prayer, we share the 
          universal desire to speak and listen to our Maker and to seek 
          the plans He has for our lives. We recognize the ways that He 
          has blessed our land abundantly, and we offer thanks for these 
          gifts and for the generosity of our Nation in helping those in 
          need. We are grateful for our freedom, for God's love, mercy, 
          and forgiveness, and for a hope that will never be shaken.
          Today, our Nation is strong and prosperous. Our Armed Forces 
          have achieved great success on the battlefield, but challenges 
          still lie ahead. Prayer will not make our path easy, yet 
          prayer can give us strength and hope for the journey.
          As we continue to fight against terror, we ask the Almighty to 
          protect all those who battle for freedom throughout the world 
          and our brave men and women in uniform, and we ask Him to 
          shield innocents from harm. We recognize the sacrifice of our 
          military families and ask God to grant them peace and 
          strength. We will not forget the men and women who have fallen 
          in service to America and to the cause of freedom. We pray 
          that their loved ones will receive God's comfort and grace.
          In this hour of history's calling, Americans are bowing humbly 
          in churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, and in their own 
          homes, in the presence of the Almighty. This day, I ask our 
          Nation to join me in praying for the strength to meet the 
          challenges before us, for the wisdom to know and do what is 
          right, for continued determination to work towards making our 
          society a more compassionate and decent place, and for peace 
          in the affairs of men.
          The Congress, by Public Law 100	307, as amended, has called on 
          our citizens to reaffirm the role of prayer in our society and 
          to honor the religious diversity our freedom permits by 
          recognizing annually a ``National Day of Prayer.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2003, as a 
          National Day of Prayer. I ask the citizens of our Nation to 
          pray, each after his or her own faith, in thanksgiving for the 
          freedoms and blessings we have received and for God's 
          continued guidance and protection. I also urge all Americans 
          to join in observing this day with appropriate programs, 
          ceremonies, and activities.

Jewish Heritage Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          The extraordinary heritage of Jewish Americans reflects the 
          strength and spirit of our Nation. Their deep family and 
          community ties and strong religious traditions exemplify 
          America's cultural diversity. Jewish Heritage Week provides an 
          opportunity to recognize the contributions of Jewish Americans 
          to our country and to celebrate their commitment to faith, 
          family, and freedom.
          The Jewish people began their search for freedom more than 
          3,000 years ago. From the struggle of the Exodus, to the 
          miracle of the Maccabees, to the horrors of the Holocaust, to 
          the creation of the democratic State of Israel, Jews have 
          faced and survived many challenges. Jews draw on their faith 
          to provide hope for the future.
          For centuries, Jews have immigrated to the United States to 
          realize their dreams and enjoy the blessings of religious 
          tolerance and individual liberty. Today, Jewish Americans play 
          an important role in the success and growth of our country. 
          Their accomplishments in education, industry, science, art, 
          literature, and dozens of other fields have strengthened our 
          Nation and enriched our culture.
          Throughout their history, Jewish Americans have demonstrated 
          that goodness can overcome evil. Guided by moral principles, 
          they bring to our Nation a rich heritage that recognizes the 
          dignity of every citizen and the possibilities of every life. 
          Countless Jewish charitable organizations are helping serve 
          the men, women, and children across our country who are in 
          need. Their works of kindness and mercy help to build a more 
          generous and compassionate Nation.
          During this week, we also recognize the many Jewish Americans 
          serving in our Armed Forces who are working to rid the world 
          of terror and bring freedom and justice to the oppressed. 
          Every generation of Americans must rise to meet its own 
          challenges, and this generation of Jewish Americans is 
          standing strong to defend our freedoms and help make America a 
          land of opportunity for all.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim May 4 through May 11, 2003, as Jewish Heritage Week. 
          I urge all Americans to learn more about the rich history of 
          Jewish Americans and to celebrate their contribution to our 
          cultural diversity.

Proclamation 7674 of May 7, 2003

Mother's Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          On Mother's Day, we honor the dedicated and caring women who 
          are devoted to their families and committed to improving the 
          world their children will inherit. Our first President, George 
          Washington, said that his mother was ``the most beautiful 
          woman I ever saw. All I am I owe to my mother.'' America owes 
          much of its goodness and strength to mothers, including 
          adoptive mothers, stepmothers, and foster mothers.
          Mother's Day began as a day of love and friendship, designed 
          to help heal families divided across battle lines during the 
          Civil War. In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson signed a 
          resolution officially establishing Mother's Day to honor the 
          role of women in the family. On Mother's Day, 2003, we carry 
          on the tradition by recognizing our mothers for their strength 
          and compassion. We also recognize them for showing 
          unconditional love and teaching positive values.
          Mothers nurture a child's physical and emotional growth, nurse 
          illness, ease failure, and cheer success. They instill 
          important values in children and help provide the tools they 
          need to make the right choices and grow up to be responsible, 
          compassionate, and successful members of society.
          As we honor our mothers on this special day, we celebrate 
          their contributions to the character of our next generation of 
          leaders. And we remember the lessons our mothers have taught 
          us: That it is better to give than to receive, that we must 
          love our neighbors as ourselves, and that service to others 
          brings joy.
          The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914, as 
          amended (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in 
          May each year as ``Mother's Day'' and has requested the 
          President to call for its appropriate observance. It is my 
          honor and privilege to do so again.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim May 11, 2003, as 
          Mother's Day. I encourage all Americans to express their love, 
          respect, and appreciation to mothers everywhere for their 
          contributions to their children, families, communities, and 
          our Nation. I also call upon citizens to observe this day with 
          appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh 
          day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7675 of May 9, 2003

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Every day across the country, from our largest cities to our 
          quietest crossroads, peace officers stand watch over our 
          citizens, selflessly risking their lives to protect 
          individuals, families, neighborhoods, and property against 
          crime. This week, we salute these men and women for their 
          courage, commitment, and service, and we honor those who have 
          fallen in the line of duty. We also reaffirm our commitment to 
          supporting law enforcement by bringing our communities 
          together to fight crime.
          Peace officers fulfill a great calling in upholding the rule 
          of law in our society. Law enforcement officers choose their 
          profession and take their oaths knowing that theirs is a 
          dangerous job. They accept these risks, answering the call of 
          duty and demonstrating a willingness to serve that reflects 
          the best of America.
          As they work to protect our communities, peace officers often 
          place themselves in harm's way. Some make the ultimate 
          sacrifice in defense of others. During Police Week, and 
          particularly on Peace Officers Memorial Day, we pay tribute to 
          the 148 law enforcement officers who gave their lives in the 
          line of duty last year. Those who have fallen are remembered 
          in our hearts and in the memory of our country. Through their 
          service and sacrifice, they have earned our Nation's respect 
          and gratitude.
          As we honor these fallen heroes, we should also resolve to 
          support all law enforcement officers by becoming active in the 
          fight against crime. Strong communities and neighborhoods help 
          deter crime. By coming together as neighbors, and by looking 
          out for each other, Americans can assist law enforcement in 
          preventing crime in our communities and also help secure our 
          homeland from the threat of terrorism. In the new world we 
          face since September 11, one of our best defenses is a 
          vigilant public working with law enforcement to help protect 
          our land.
          I created the USA Freedom Corps to foster a culture of 
          service, citizenship, and responsibility in America, and to 
          provide opportunities for Americans to get involved in helping 
          their communities. A key component of Freedom Corps is the 
          Citizen Corps, which helps coordinate volunteer activities 
          that make our communities safer, stronger, and better prepared 
          for emergencies. Since the Citizens Corps was launched last 
          year, more than 500 Citizen Corps Councils have been 
          established, bringing together first responders, local 
          government officials, and volunteer service organizations.
          Volunteers are also working with police departments through 
          more than 430 Volunteers in Police Service programs in our 
          Nation. Additionally, the number of registered Neighborhood 
          Watch groups continues to grow. To build on these successes, 
          we should continue to strengthen partnerships between citizens 
          and local law enforcement and work to engage more volunteers 
          in public safety and emergency preparedness. By joining 
          together to fight crime, we honor the memory and uphold the 
          legacy of all those who gave their lives to preserve our 
          safety and security.

[[Page 65]]

          By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended, 
          (76 Stat. 676), the Congress has authorized and requested the 
          President to designate May 15 of each year as ``Peace Officers 
          Memorial Day'' and the week in which it falls as ``Police 
          Week,'' and, by Public Law 103	322, as amended, (36 U.S.C. 
          136), has directed that the flag be flown at half-staff on 
          Peace Officers Memorial Day.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2003, as Peace 
          Officers Memorial Day and May 11 through May 17, 2003, as 
          Police Week. I call on all Americans to observe these events 
          with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on 
          Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
          Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of 
          government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on 
          Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans 
          to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and 
          businesses on that day.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day 
          of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of the

Proclamation 7676 of May 9, 2003

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          America's transportation system takes us where we need to go, 
          keeps our economy moving, and strengthens our Nation's 
          security. On National Defense Transportation Day and during 
          National Transportation Week, we celebrate how modern 
          transportation has transformed the world and recognize the men 
          and women who have contributed to its progress. We also renew 
          our commitment to increasing transportation safety and to 
          keeping our transportation system on the leading edge of 
          technology.
          Our 21st century transportation system safely and securely 
          transports our citizens and delivers a wide range of goods 
          throughout the country and the world. In times of war, our 
          transportation system also moves troops and carries defense 
          cargo efficiently. Preserving and enhancing our transportation 
          resources makes that infrastructure safer, facilitates growth 
          in business and industry, creates jobs, secures our Nation, 
          and improves the quality of life of our citizens.
          To sustain these advantages, we must continue to invest in our 
          Nation's transportation systems. From enhancing existing 
          highways, waterways, railway lines, pipelines, and airports, 
          to developing fuel-efficient and reduced-emissions vehicles, 
          we must work towards improving safety, protecting the 
          environment, and furthering our national defense. As part of 
          these efforts, my Administration has announced a hydrogen fuel 
          initiative to reverse America's growing dependence on foreign 
          oil by developing the technology

[[Page 66]]

          to produce commercially viable, hydrogen fuel cells, which 
          will help power cars and trucks with no emissions of air 
          pollution or greenhouse gases. This new national commitment 
          could make it possible for the first car driven by a child 
          born today to be powered by hydrogen, and be pollution-free.
          Through the newly created Department of Homeland Security, my 
          Administration is working towards strengthening protections 
          throughout our national transportation system. Designed to 
          increase protections for America's citizens while maintaining 
          the free flow of goods and people across our borders, our 
          comprehensive national plan includes selective maritime 
          restrictions, increased airport security, and improved 
          railroad infrastructure security. We are also enforcing 
          temporary flight restrictions and flying Combat Air Patrols 
          over critical sites, increasing surveillance of hazardous 
          material shipments within our country, and taking measures to 
          keep hazardous materials away from places where large numbers 
          of people gather. We are determined to defend the American 
          homeland, and we will do all in our power to make sure our 
          skies, rails, pipelines, waterways, and roads are safe from 
          terror.
          To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation 
          industry and who contribute to our Nation's well-being, and 
          defense, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 16, 
          1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), has designated the third 
          Friday in May of each year as ``National Defense 
          Transportation Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 
          14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), declared that the week 
          during which that Friday falls be designated as ``National 
          Transportation Week.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 16, 2003, as 
          National Defense Transportation Day and May 11 through May 17, 
          2003, as National Transportation Week. I encourage all 
          Americans to learn more about how our modern transportation 
          system enhances our economy and contributes to our freedom.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day 
          of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of the 
          Independence of the United States of America the two hundred

Proclamation 7677 of May 9, 2003

National Safe Boating Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          As summer approaches, Americans are looking forward to 
          enjoying our Nation's rivers, lakes, and oceans. National 
          statistics show that recreational boating is safer today than 
          ever before, with the number of boating fatalities declining 
          even as the number of boats increases. However, lives continue 
          to be lost needlessly, and we must remain committed to boating 
          safety.

[[Page 67]]

          During National Safe Boating Week, we are reminded that 
          practicing simple steps can make recreational boating safer 
          and more enjoyable.
          This year's theme, ``Boat Smart. Boat Safe. Wear It!'' 
          highlights the importance and ease of wearing life jackets. 
          Drowning remains the number one cause of recreational boating 
          fatalities. According to the United States Coast Guard, nearly 
          80 percent of those who died in boating accidents in 2001 were 
          not wearing life jackets. In many of these cases, life jackets 
          were available on board, but were useless to the passengers in 
          the boats because the speed and suddenness of the accident 
          prevented them from having time to put on their life jackets. 
          The chances of surviving a serious boating accident increase 
          dramatically by wearing a life jacket. Modern life jackets are 
          smaller, lighter, and more flexible, making them easier and 
          more comfortable to wear.
           The National Safe Boating Council, the National Association 
          of State Boating Law Administrators, and the U.S. Coast Guard 
          are working with other campaign partners to encourage safe 
          boating practices through the 2003 North American Safe Boating 
          Campaign. In addition to wearing life jackets, the campaign 
          encourages boaters to enroll in a boating safety class, to 
          ensure that boats are properly maintained and checked for 
          safety, to follow regulations and guidelines relating to 
          homeland security issues, and not to consume alcohol when 
          operating a boat. More information about staying safe on the 
          water is available by visiting the U.S. Coast Guard's Office 
          of Boating Safety website at www.uscgboating.org. By improving 
          our skills and increasing our knowledge of recreational 
          boating safety, we can reduce the loss of life, the injuries, 
          and the property damage that occur on our waterways.
          Safe boating also contributes to homeland security and frees 
          the time of public safety officers to focus on enforcement 
          issues. The same Coast Guard members, marine patrol, police, 
          and fire officers who respond to recreational boating 
          accidents are also responsible for protecting the security of 
          our ports and waterways. By avoiding boating accidents, 
          Americans can help these officials devote more time and effort 
          to safeguarding our homeland.
          In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, 
          the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 
          U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the 
          President to proclaim annually the 7-day period prior to 
          Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe Boating Week.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim May 17 through May 23, 
          2003, as National Safe Boating Week. I encourage the Governors 
          of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth 
          of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas subject to 
          the jurisdiction of the United States, to join in observing 
          this occasion. I also urge boaters to learn about proper 
          boating practices, including the wearing of life jackets, and 
          to take advantage of boating safety programs throughout the 
          year.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day 
          of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of the 
          Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
          and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7678 of May 15, 2003

National Hurricane Awareness Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Destructive winds, tornadoes, torrential rains, ocean water 
          storm surges, and flooding make hurricanes one of nature's 
          most extreme hazards. As hurricane season approaches, 
          Americans who live in hurricane-prone areas must prepare to 
          help ensure their safety and minimize damage to their 
          communities.
          Hurricane season officially begins June 1 and continues 
          through November 30. According to the National Oceanic and 
          Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Federal Emergency 
          Management Agency (FEMA), an average of 10 tropical storms 
          develop in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of 
          Mexico, and 6 become hurricanes each year. In the past 2 years 
          alone, 9 tropical storms and 1 hurricane hit our country, 
          causing 54 deaths and more than $6 billion in damages. While 
          we cannot stop these storms from occurring, we can take steps 
          to limit our vulnerability. Being aware of the dangers of 
          tropical storms and hurricanes and knowing what to do to 
          mitigate their devastating effects are our best defenses.
          Federal, State, and local agencies across America are working 
          diligently to prepare our communities for natural disasters. 
          Beginning this year, NOAA's hurricane forecasts will look 5 
          days into the future, rather than 3 days. This enhanced 
          forecasting ability, combined with efforts to improve the 
          accuracy of hurricane warnings, enables coastal residents and 
          emergency personnel to more effectively prepare for a storm's 
          arrival. In addition, Federal agencies such as FEMA and 
          organizations such as the American Red Cross have teamed up 
          with State and local agencies, rescue and relief 
          organizations, the private sector, and the news media to 
          distribute information to the public and coordinate efforts 
          before, during, and after a tropical storm or hurricane has 
          struck.
          To help individuals prepare for an approaching tropical storm 
          or hurricane, FEMA recommends practical measures, to make sure 
          that homes and businesses are ready by developing a plan for 
          what to do; securing loose objects and protecting property by 
          covering glass with plywood or shutters; and creating a 
          disaster supply kit with flashlights, a battery-powered radio, 
          food that does not need refrigeration, water, and first aid 
          supplies. The National Weather Service also encourages 
          acquiring a weather radio equipped with the Specific Area 
          Message Encoder feature that provides automatic alerts when 
          important weather information is issued for an area. For more 
          information on how to prepare for the ravages of hazardous 
          weather, you can go to the National Weather Service website at 
          www.nws.noaa.gov.
          Millions of Americans are at risk of being personally affected 
          by a tropical storm or hurricane. More than one in six 
          Americans in the continental United States lives along the 
          Eastern Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico coast, and millions of 
          tourists visit these areas annually. Because of the growing 
          populations in coastal areas, it is essential that Americans 
          prepare for hurricanes and other natural disasters. During 
          National Hurricane Awareness Week, we promote awareness of 
          these weather hazards, organize our efforts, and

[[Page 69]]

          work to improve our ability to endure and survive tropical 
          storms and hurricanes.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim May 18 through May 24, 2003, as National Hurricane 
          Awareness Week. I call upon government agencies, private 
          organizations, schools, and news media in hurricane-prone 
          areas to share information about hurricane preparedness and 
          response in order to help prevent storm damage and save lives. 
          I also call upon Americans living in these coastal areas of 
          our Nation to use this opportunity to learn more about how to 
          protect themselves against the effects of hurricanes and 
          tropical storms.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth 
          day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7679 of May 16, 2003

World Trade Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Trade expands prosperity, helps raise millions from poverty, 
          and is an engine of economic growth within our Nation and 
          around the world. Trade injects new energy and vitality into 
          the global economy by fostering the exchange of ideas and 
          innovations among people around the world. Free and open trade 
          also helps promote peace and security. During World Trade 
          Week, we renew our commitment to developing and implementing 
          trade policies that create new opportunities and promote 
          global economic growth.
          My Administration is pursuing an ambitious trade agenda that 
          is restoring America's leadership in the global trading 
          system. We worked hard for the passage of the Trade Act of 
          2002, which reinstated Trade Promotion Authority after an 8-
          year lapse. Trade Promotion Authority re-established the 
          ability of the United States to credibly negotiate 
          comprehensive trade agreements by ensuring that agreements 
          will be approved or rejected, by the Congress, but not 
          amended. This gives other countries renewed confidence in 
          their trade negotiations with the United States.
          To extend the benefits of trade and to improve the lives of 
          people in our Nation and around the world, my Administration 
          continues to pursue global, regional, and bilateral trade 
          agreements. Through the Doha Development Agenda negotiations 
          at the World Trade Organization, the United States is seeking 
          to strengthen the multilateral trading system, increase market 
          access opportunities, and promote global development. 
          Regionally, we are working to build on the success of the 
          North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the Free 
          Trade Area of the Americas, which will expand free trade 
          benefits throughout the Western Hemisphere. We are also

[[Page 70]]

          encouraging the free flow of trade and investment in the 
          Pacific among our partners in the Asia-Pacific Economic 
          Cooperation forum and the Association of Southeast Asian 
          Nations. In addition, we are negotiating a free trade 
          agreement with five Central American democracies and will soon 
          begin free trade agreement negotiations with the Southern 
          African Customs Union to help spur economic growth in these 
          two regions. Bilaterally, I recently signed a historic free 
          trade agreement with Singapore_the first of its kind between 
          the United States and an Asian/Pacific country, and we are 
          finalizing a similar agreement with Chile. Free trade 
          agreement negotiations are also underway with Australia and 
          Morocco.
          In America, trade is also critical to maintaining our economic 
          competitiveness in the global market. It has been estimated 
          that one in eleven American jobs_over 12 million_are supported 
          by exports of goods and services. In the 1990s, exports 
          accounted for about one-quarter of our economic growth. Our 
          Nation's two major trade agreements during this time, NAFTA 
          and the Uruguay Round, provided consumers with a greater 
          choice of goods at better prices, while raising living 
          standards for a typical American family of four by up to 
          $2,000 a year.
          My Administration is also providing assistance to help trade-
          impacted workers adapt to the challenge of international 
          competition. The Trade Adjustment Assistance program helps 
          trade-impacted workers gain or enhance job-related skills and 
          find new jobs. The program provides eligible workers with up 
          to 2 years of training, income support during training, job 
          search assistance, and relocation allowances.
          World trade allows all nations to share in the great economic, 
          social, and political progress of our age and provides a 
          foundation for a more peaceful and stable world. This week, we 
          recognize the importance of free trade in promoting prosperity 
          and freedom in the United States and around the world.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim May 18 through May 24, 2003, as World Trade Week. I 
          encourage all Americans to observe this week with events, 
          trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate the 
          benefits of trade to our Nation and the global economy.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth 
          day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7680 of May 21, 2003

National Maritime Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Today, as in the past, America depends on our maritime 
          services to help ensure our security, promote our prosperity, 
          and advance the universal

[[Page 71]]

          hope of freedom. We honor the service and proud history of our 
          merchant mariners and also recognize their important 
          contributions in strengthening our economy.
          For generations, merchant marines and commercial sailors have 
          assisted in the defense of our Nation. Most recently, more 
          than 5,000 merchant mariners supported Operations Enduring 
          Freedom and Iraqi Freedom by serving aboard 157 ships moving 
          essential supplies to our troops. As they continue to support 
          our troops in the ongoing war on terror, their mission 
          continues to be dangerous and difficult, and remains vital to 
          our efforts to defend the peace.
          We also remember the vital role the Merchant Marine has played 
          in past conflicts. More than 6,000 merchant mariners lost 
          their lives during World War II, and more than 700 U.S. 
          merchant ships were lost. Even before the United States 
          declared war, merchant mariners were making perilous runs to 
          Europe with desperately needed supplies. President Franklin 
          Roosevelt, the first President to issue a proclamation 
          honoring merchant mariners, wrote of their role during 
          wartime: ``They have delivered the goods when and where needed 
          in every theater of operations and across every ocean in the 
          biggest, the most difficult and dangerous transportation job 
          ever undertaken.'' We are grateful for the contributions and 
          sacrifices of America's merchant mariners before and after 
          World War II, in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, and around 
          the world today.
          In addition to their efforts to support our troops, merchant 
          marines play a vital role in moving the goods that we produce 
          around the United States and throughout the world. Their work 
          provides jobs and economic benefits to our country, and 
          strengthens our economy. By operating as the eyes and ears of 
          America at sea, they also help protect our homeland.
          In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, 
          the Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 20, 1933, as 
          amended, has designated May 22 of each year as ``National 
          Maritime Day,'' and has authorized and requested that the 
          President issue an annual proclamation calling for its 
          appropriate observance.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2003, as 
          National Maritime Day. I call upon the people of the United 
          States to celebrate this observance and to display the flag of 
          the United States at their homes and in their communities. I 
          also request that all ships sailing under the American flag 
          dress ship on that day.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7681 of May 22, 2003

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          On Memorial Day, America undertakes its solemn duty to 
          remember the sacred list of brave Americans who have 
          sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom and the 
          security of our Nation. By honoring these proud Soldiers, 
          Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen lost throughout 
          our country's history, we renew our commitment to upholding 
          the democratic ideals they fought and died to preserve.
          Each Memorial Day, we pray for peace throughout the world, 
          remembering what was gained and what was lost during times of 
          war. From the bravery of the men at Valley Forge, to the 
          daring of Normandy, the courage of Iwo Jima, and the steady 
          resolve in Afghanistan and Iraq, our men and women in uniform 
          have won for us every hour that we live in freedom. During 
          this year's observance, we particularly recognize the 
          courageous spirit of the men and women in our Nation's Armed 
          Forces who are working with our coalition partners to restore 
          civil order, provide critical humanitarian aid, and renew 
          Afghanistan and Iraq. As we honor those who have served and 
          have been lost, we better understand the meaning of patriotism 
          and citizenship, and we pledge that their sacrifices will not 
          be in vain.
          Throughout our history, the decency, character, and idealism 
          of our military troops have turned enemies into allies and 
          oppression into hope. In all our victories, American soldiers 
          have fought to liberate, not to conquer; and today, the United 
          States joins with a strong coalition in the noble cause of 
          liberty and peace for the world. On this day, America honors 
          her own, but we also recognize the shared victories and 
          hardships of our allied forces who have served and fallen 
          alongside our troops.
          The noble sacrifices of our service men and women will not be 
          forgotten. Every name, every life is a loss to our military, 
          to our Nation, and to their loved ones. Americans stand with 
          the families who grieve, and we share in their great sorrow 
          and great pride. There will be no homecoming on this Earth for 
          those lost in battle, but we know that this reunion will one 
          day come.
          In respect for their devotion to America, the Congress, by a 
          joint resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (64 
          Stat. 158), has requested the President to issue a 
          proclamation calling on the people of the United States to 
          observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent 
          peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
          the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by 
          Public Law 106	579, has also designated the minute beginning 
          at 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all 
          Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 26, 
          2003, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate 
          the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day 
          as a time to unite in prayer. I also ask all Americans to 
          observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at

[[Page 73]]

          3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I urge the press, radio, 
          television, and all other media to participate in these 
          observances.
          I also request the Governors of the United States and the 
          Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of 
          all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at 
          half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, 
          grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States, and 
          in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also 
          request the people of the United States to display the flag at 
          half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          second day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7682 of May 23, 2003

National Missing Children's Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          On National Missing Children's Day, we join with families, law 
          enforcement officials, and child advocates to highlight our 
          commitment to stopping the abduction and exploitation of 
          children. During this year's observance, we celebrate the 
          progress we have made in safeguarding children, and we renew 
          our dedication to protecting our most vulnerable citizens and 
          our most valuable resources.
          The Department of Justice estimates that more than 50,000 
          children will be victims of nonfamily abductions each year. 
          While the rate of recovery in such kidnappings is 
          approximately 99 percent, the trauma of abduction affects far 
          too many. No young person in America should ever know the 
          terror of abduction, and no family should ever have to 
          experience the nightmare of having a loved one suddenly taken.
          The safety and well-being of our children is a shared 
          responsibility for all Americans and for Federal, State, and 
          local authorities. My Administration is making the prevention 
          and investigation of child abductions a top priority. We are 
          working to use available resources to educate our citizens 
          about how to prevent child abductions. We are also creating 
          new lines of communication between authorities and the public 
          to help find and safely return missing children to their 
          families. We will continue to vigorously prosecute and 
          severely punish those who would harm our children.
          To further these efforts, in August 2002, my Administration 
          released a new guidebook, ``Personal Safety for Children: A 
          Guide for Parents'' to teach parents steps to improve their 
          children's safety. Since then, copies have been distributed to 
          public and private schools and public libraries throughout the 
          country, in both English and Spanish. In October 2002, I 
          convened the first White House Conference on Missing, 
          Exploited, and Runaway

[[Page 74]]

          Children to promote public awareness of the issues and to 
          generate recommendations and best practices from experts. And 
          in December 2002, I signed legislation creating the Dot Kids 
          domain, a child-friendly zone on the Internet. The sites on 
          this domain are monitored for content and safety, offering 
          parents peace of mind knowing that their children can learn in 
          a safe and healthy environment.
          Last month I signed the PROTECT Act, an important law that 
          provides valuable new ways to deter, investigate, prosecute, 
          and punish crimes against America's children. The PROTECT Act 
          also builds on my Administration's ongoing efforts to expand 
          and improve the AMBER Alert program, which has become an 
          increasingly important tool to help rescue kidnapped children 
          by quickly getting key information about the missing child and 
          the suspect to the public. This law formally establishes the 
          Federal Government's role in the AMBER Alert system and equips 
          the Department of Justice to help State and local officials 
          develop, enhance, and coordinate AMBER plans across America.
          Our Nation has come to know the names and faces of far too 
          many children because they have been the victims of acts of 
          cruelty and violence. These crimes break our hearts and stir 
          our anger. Our Nation shares the joy of the parents who are 
          reunited with their children, and prays with those who are 
          still hoping and waiting. We grieve with every family that has 
          suffered the loss of or injury to a child. We will continue 
          the fight against the threats that our children face.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim May 25, 2003, as National Missing Children's Day. I 
          call upon Americans to join me in commemorating this 
          observance by celebrating those children who have been 
          returned to their loved ones, remembering those young people 
          who are missing, and continuing to work together on every 
          front to protect our children from those who would seek to 
          harm them.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          third day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7683 of May 30, 2003

National Child's Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          On National Child's Day, we celebrate the future of our Nation 
          and the promise of America's youth. As a Nation, as parents, 
          and as community members, we have a responsibility to build a 
          secure and nurturing society so that our children have the 
          opportunity to grow, learn, work, and succeed.

[[Page 75]]

          Creating an environment that instills important values, builds 
          strong character, and provides sound education for our 
          children is a vital national priority. With a firm foundation, 
          children will be better able to face the challenges of the 
          future.
          Parents are a child's first teachers, and they can be the most 
          effective instructors. One of the most helpful activities 
          parents can do with their children is read with them. Children 
          who develop a love for reading expand their imaginations and 
          cultivate a thirst for learning that lasts a lifetime. By 
          talking, listening, and reading to our children, we can help 
          them build the confidence they need to succeed in life. 
          Parents' role as educators becomes even more important as 
          schools across the country prepare for summer recess. 
          Summertime is not only a time for children to relax and play, 
          it is also a time for parents to strengthen their ties to 
          their children by spending time with them and helping them to 
          broaden their experiences.
          To expand on the important work that parents do, my 
          Administration has taken significant steps to help give our 
          children greater opportunities to learn. By improving our 
          education system and encouraging early reading and language 
          skills, we give our children the tools they will need to 
          succeed in the world they will inherit from us. Children also 
          benefit from the immeasurable care and support of their 
          teachers, and are inspired by the model they set.
          Outside the home and the classroom, there are many adults who 
          touch children's lives. Family, mentors, neighbors, and 
          friends can help mold America's next generation through their 
          positive examples, showing children how to help those in need 
          and encouraging them to set high standards for themselves. To 
          help instill the value of volunteer service, the USA Freedom 
          Corps, through the Students in Service to America initiative, 
          is helping to create ways for young people to give back to 
          their communities. By using their time, talents, and 
          compassion to make a difference in the lives of others, 
          America's children are learning to become responsible and 
          engaged leaders in our democratic society.
          On this special day, we celebrate the possibility of every boy 
          and girl in America. In their faces, we see the hope of our 
          Nation. America is dedicated to their welfare and the full 
          development of their potential.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim June 1, 2003, as National Child's Day. I urge parents 
          to spend more time with their children, read to them, listen 
          to their concerns, offer guidance and love, and encourage 
          their dreams. I also urge all Americans to set a positive 
          example for our children and to assist parents in setting them 
          on the path to success. And I call upon citizens to observe 
          this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
          activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth 
          day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7684 of June 6, 2003

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Each year, we set aside June 14 to commemorate the day in 1777 
          when the Continental Congress adopted the Stars and Stripes as 
          the official flag of our Republic. With this act, the Congress 
          declared that we were one Nation, under one flag, united for 
          the cause of liberty and justice for all.
          As a symbol of our patriotism, the American flag continues to 
          invoke pride and resolve among our people, especially when we 
          see it next to a headstone, on the masts of our military 
          ships, worn by the generations of Americans who have proudly 
          served our country, or emerging from the wreckage caused by a 
          natural or manmade disaster. Flying over public buildings, 
          monuments, schools, and homes, our flag is testament to the 
          ideals of American democracy.
          Through the years, millions of immigrants have come to our 
          shores seeking to share in the promise of freedom represented 
          by our flag. From war-torn Europe, to the mountains of 
          Afghanistan, to the deserts of Iraq, the flag and those who 
          carry it are universally recognized as harbingers of 
          liberation, justice, and peace. Regardless of circumstance, 
          our flag endures as a sign of hope.
          On Flag Day, we look to the red, white, and blue as a symbol 
          of our commitment to advancing the universal hope of liberty 
          and justice for all. Old Glory abounds in the landscape of our 
          daily lives, reminding us of the freedom we share. The 50 
          stars and 13 stripes are not just a random pattern, they 
          symbolize the blessings of liberty we enjoy as Americans.
          To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by 
          joint resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 
          492), designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and 
          requested that the President issue an annual proclamation 
          calling for its observance and for the display of the Flag of 
          the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The 
          Congress also requested, by joint resolution approved June 9, 
          1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President issue 
          annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
          occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all citizens 
          of the United States to display the flag during that week.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2003, as Flag 
          Day and the week beginning June 8, 2003, as National Flag 
          Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag 
          on all Federal Government buildings during that week, and I 
          urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week 
          by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
          suitable places. I also call upon the people of the United 
          States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days 
          from Flag Day through Independence Day, also set aside by the 
          Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to 
          celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, 
          and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of 
          the United States of America.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day 
          of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of

Proclamation 7685 of June 13, 2003

National Homeownership Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Homeownership is more than just a symbol of the American 
          Dream; it is an important part of our way of life. Core 
          American values of individuality, thrift, responsibility, and 
          self-reliance are embodied in homeownership. I am committed to 
          helping more families know the security and sense of pride 
          that comes with owning a home.
          The Department of Housing and Urban Development is leading an 
          Administration-wide effort to bring new tools and resources to 
          would-be homeowners. We are providing financial assistance to 
          qualified families through the American Dream Downpayment 
          Fund, funding educational programs that stress financial 
          literacy, and offering a compassionate hand to those who dream 
          of moving from subsidized housing into homeownership. And 
          through the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, my 
          Administration partners with nonprofit organizations that 
          offer homeownership opportunities to families willing to 
          contribute their skills and labor to help build a home of 
          their own. We are also proposing ways to make it easier to 
          shop for a mortgage and to make mortgages available to more 
          families through the Federal Housing Administration.
          Today, the United States is fortunate in that our 
          homeownership rate is at an all-time high, and low interest 
          rates continue to encourage millions of Americans to become 
          first-time homeowners. Although a record number of Americans 
          own their own homes, we continue to see a gap between the 
          homeownership rates of minorities and nonminorities. By a 
          significant margin, minority families are less likely to own 
          their own homes. Therefore, I have called upon the entire 
          housing industry to join with my Administration to expand 
          minority homeownership across the Nation. Our goal is to help 
          at least 5.5 million minority families become homeowners by 
          the end of this decade, and our Blueprint for the American 
          Dream Partnership is taking bold steps to make this a reality.
          Across our Nation, every citizen, regardless of race, creed, 
          color, or place of birth, should have the opportunity to 
          become a homeowner. Homeownership represents a pathway to 
          pride and prosperity for many families, encourages values of 
          responsibility and sacrifice, creates stability for 
          neighborhoods and communities, and generates economic growth 
          that helps strengthen the entire Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and

[[Page 78]]

          laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2003 as 
          National Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the 
          United States to join me in recognizing the importance of 
          offering every American the opportunity to realize their dream 
          of homeownership and to help work towards making that dream a 
          reality.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          thirteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7686 of June 13, 2003

Father's Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Fatherhood is one of life's most challenging yet fulfilling 
          endeavors. On Father's Day, we honor America's fathers and 
          express our appreciation for all they do to help build a 
          strong foundation for our children and our Nation. We also 
          reaffirm our commitment to supporting fathers and encouraging 
          responsible fatherhood in our society.
          Fathers have indispensable roles to play in the lives of their 
          children: provider, protector, nurturer, teacher, and friend. 
          Every caring father unconditionally loves his sons and 
          daughters and strives for the best for his children in the 
          future. In seeking to give their children the opportunity to 
          succeed, fathers offer needed strength, guidance, and 
          discipline.
          Fathers teach their children many basic things in life: how to 
          read a book, throw a ball, tie a necktie, ride a bike, or 
          drive a car. More importantly, they also help instill time- 
          honored values in their children, such as hard work, respect, 
          honesty, and good citizenship. Through their words, actions, 
          and sacrifices, fathers play an important role in shaping the 
          characters of their sons and daughters.
          The time and attention that a father gives to a child is 
          irreplaceable_there is no substitute for the involvement and 
          commitment of a responsible father. Not only are fathers 
          essential to the healthy development of children, they also 
          influence the strength of families and the stability of 
          communities.
          For this reason, our Government is working to help fathers 
          succeed in this challenging, but life-affirming, role. Over 
          the last 2 years, my Administration has taken important steps 
          to promote responsible fatherhood and encourage community-
          based initiatives that help them fulfill their important 
          roles. We are working to provide funds for healthy marriage 
          and parenting education and for community mentoring programs 
          to help fathers become more engaged and involved in their 
          children's lives.
          This Father's Day, we recognize the many fathers who are 
          heroes and role models for their children, and we encourage 
          more men to fulfill this responsibility by loving their sons 
          and daughters with all their heart and

[[Page 79]]

          demonstrating this love daily. By working together to 
          encourage America's fathers, we can strengthen our society and 
          help ensure the well-being of all our children.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of 
          the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 
          109), do hereby proclaim June 15, 2003, as Father's Day. I 
          encourage all Americans to express love, admiration, and 
          thanks to their fathers for their contributions to our lives 
          and to society. I direct the appropriate officials of the 
          Government to display the flag of the United States on all 
          Government buildings on this day. I also call upon State and 
          local governments and citizens to observe this day with 
          appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          thirteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7687 of June 24, 2003

Black Music Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          For centuries, black artists have created or inspired 
          distinctively American musical styles. During Black Music 
          Month, we celebrate the ways that African-American music has 
          helped shape American society and reflect the character of our 
          Nation, and we recognize the pioneers who spearheaded these 
          important musical forms.
          Throughout history, African-American music has shown the 
          social climate of the time. From the days of slavery and 
          discrimination, through the progress of the Civil Rights 
          movement, to today, black music has told the story of the 
          African-American experience. In addition to giving voice to 
          black struggles, faith, and joys, African-American music has 
          helped also to bring people together. Before our Nation's 
          strides toward equal justice, music such as jazz and blues 
          provided a venue in which people of all races could be judged 
          by their talent, and not the color of their skin.
          The people who sang the earliest African-American music knew 
          the worst of human cruelty and earthly injustice. In 
          spirituals, work songs, and shouts, we hear the pain of 
          separation and the bitterness of oppression. We also hear 
          courage, and the comfort and strength of a faith that trusts 
          God to right every wrong and wipe away every tear. These songs 
          were used to share stories, spread ideas, preserve history, 
          and establish community.
          Early work songs and spirituals laid the creative foundation 
          for the development of gospel, blues, and jazz. In black 
          churches throughout the south, gospel offered a medium to 
          share the good news. The beauty of both gospel and the blues 
          lies in their power to express emotions that can be felt as 
          well as heard. The blues were first popularized in America by 
          W.C. Handy.

[[Page 80]]

          A classically trained musician, this ``Father of the Blues'' 
          helped to compose and distribute blues music throughout the 
          country. His music continues to touch people today.
          In the early 20th century, the progression to jazz took place 
          all over the country, from the deep south of New Orleans and 
          the Mississippi Delta to northern cities such as Chicago and 
          New York. Black artists migrated to Harlem, New York in large 
          numbers, creating a culturally diverse hub for black art, 
          writing, and music known as the Harlem Renaissance. Harlem 
          became a place of energy and magic, and timeless music emerged 
          from this period. The heart of the Harlem Renaissance is 
          reflected in the original and authentic music of such 
          influential figures as Bessie Smith, Count Basie, and Fletcher 
          Henderson.
          African Americans continued to influence popular music through 
          the 1940s and 50s, with the emergence of rhythm and blues and 
          rock and roll. These revolutionary styles built upon various 
          forms of African-American music, fusing elements of jazz, 
          blues, and gospel.
          African-American music continues to influence the American 
          music scene today with styles such as rap and hip-hop. As we 
          celebrate the many creative and inspiring African-American 
          artists whose efforts have enhanced our Nation, we recognize 
          their enduring legacy and look to a future of continued 
          musical achievement.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim June 2003 as Black Music Month. I encourage Americans 
          of all backgrounds to learn more about the heritage of black 
          musicians, and to celebrate the remarkable role they have 
          played in our history and culture.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          fourth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-seventh.

          imports from such least-developed beneficiary developing 
          countries.
          3. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C.

          6. Pursuant to section 503(d) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
          2463(d)), the President may waive the application of the 
          competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) with 
          respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary 
          developing country if certain conditions are met.
          7. (a) Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the 1974 
          Act, and after receiving advice from the International Trade 
          Commission in accordance with section 503(e) (19 U.S.C. 
          2463(e)), I have determined to designate certain articles, 
          previously designated under section 503(a)(1)(B), as eligible 
          articles when imported from any beneficiary developing

          amend the nomenclature of existing subheadings of the HTS.
           (b) Furthermore, I have determined that it is appropriate to 
          modify the application of duty-free treatment under title V of 
          the 1974 Act for a certain article, in particular for a good 
          previously eligible for such treatment that the Bureau of 
          Customs and Border Protection reclassified.
          8. Pursuant to section 503(a)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act, I have 
          determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles 
          under the GSP only for least-developed beneficiary developing 
          countries.
          9. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having 
          considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I 
          have determined to limit the application of duty-free 
          treatment accorded to certain articles from certain 
          beneficiary developing countries.
          10. Pursuant to sections 503(c)(1) and 503(c)(2)(A) of the 
          1974 Act, I have determined that certain beneficiary countries 
          should no longer receive preferential tariff treatment under 
          the GSP with respect to certain eligible articles that were 
          imported in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive 
          need limitation in 2002.
          11. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, I have 
          determined that certain countries should be redesignated as 
          beneficiary developing countries with respect to certain 
          eligible articles that previously had been imported in 
          quantities exceeding the competitive need limitations of 
          section 503(c)(2)(A).
          12. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have 
          determined that the competitive need limitation provided in 
          section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) should be waived with respect to 
          certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing 
          countries.
          13. Pursuant to section 503(d) of the 1974 Act, I have 
          determined that the competitive need limitations of section 
          503(c)(2)(A) should be waived with respect to certain eligible 
          articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. I have 
          received the advice of the International Trade Commission on 
          whether any industries in the United States are likely to be 
          adversely affected by such waiver, and I have determined, 
          based on that advice and on the considerations described in 
          sections 501 and 502(c), that such waivers are in the national 
          economic interest of the United States.
          14. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
          authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of 
          the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts 
          affecting import treatment, and actions

[[Page 83]]

          thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, 
          or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,

          to such article or articles for purposes of the GSP, and, in

          (b) In order to designate certain articles as eligible

Proclamation 7690 of July 1, 2003

30th Anniversary of the All-Volunteer Force

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Throughout our history, members of the United States Armed 
          Forces have inspired our citizens with their bravery, honor, 
          and dedication. Our Nation continues to be grateful for the 
          courageous men and women who have demonstrated extraordinary 
          patriotism in choosing to help defend America and the cause of 
          freedom.
          For the last 30 years, we have been fortunate to have a 
          military composed entirely of volunteers. When our country's 
          All-Volunteer Force was born on July 1, 1973, no comparable 
          military in the world operated on a fully volunteer basis. 
          Throughout most of the 20th century, the majority of our Armed 
          Forces personnel were drafted, serving our Nation in both 
          World Wars, the Korean conflict, and Vietnam. In the late 
          1960s, the American public's dissatisfaction with the draft 
          prompted President Richard Nixon to establish The President's 
          Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force. After studying 
          whether to retain the draft or establish a volunteer military, 
          the Commission concluded that a volunteer force would be 
          economically viable and potentially more effective. After much 
          debate, the Nixon Administration and the Congress allowed the 
          authority for the draft to lapse, and the All-Volunteer Force 
          was created.
          Since that time, our volunteer Armed Forces personnel have 
          upheld the finest traditions of our military and our country. 
          Today, more than 1.4 million men and women choose to serve on 
          active duty, along with nearly 880,000 members of the National 
          Guard and Reserves. These volunteer soldiers helped to win the 
          Cold War, turn back aggression during the Persian Gulf War, 
          keep the peace in the former Yugoslavia, liberate oppressed 
          people in Afghanistan and Iraq, and defend freedom around the 
          world.
          As we look toward the future of our country and our military, 
          our Nation gives thanks for the prowess of our military, and 
          we remain committed to providing our service men and women 
          with the tools and training they need to continue to be the 
          best in the world. On the celebration of the 30th anniversary 
          of our All-Volunteer Force, I join Americans in thanking these 
          brave men and women for choosing to serve in defense of the 
          Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim July 1, 2003, as the 30th Anniversary of the All-
          Volunteer Force. I call upon all Americans to join me in 
          recognizing this anniversary with heartfelt thanks and 
          continued support for the men and women who defend our great 
          Nation.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day 
          of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-seventh.

Proclamation 7691 of July 18, 2003

Captive Nations Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          During Captive Nations Week, first declared in 1959 as a 
          statement against the continuing Communist domination of 
          Eastern Europe, America expresses its dedication to freedom 
          and democracy. While many countries around the world uphold 
          these principles, millions of people still live under regimes 
          that violate their citizens' rights daily. In countries such 
          as Burma and Iran, citizens lack the right to choose their 
          government, speak out against oppression, and practice their 
          religion freely. The despot who rules Cuba imprisons political 
          opponents and crushes peaceful opposition, while in North 
          Korea hundreds of thousands languish in prison camps and 
          citizens suffer from malnutrition as the regime pursues 
          weapons of mass destruction. Violence, corruption, and 
          mismanagement reign in Zimbabwe and an authoritarian 
          government in Belarus smothers political dissent.
          Yet the cause of freedom is advancing. With the demise of the 
          brutal regime of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi people are no 
          longer captives in their own country. Their freedom is 
          evidence of the fall of one of the most oppressive dictators 
          in history. Today, American and coalition forces are helping 
          to restore civil order and provide critical humanitarian aid 
          to the Iraqi people. Iraqis are now meeting openly and freely 
          to discuss the future of their country. The United States vows 
          to continue to work with those trying to bring about peaceful 
          democratic change and greater respect for human rights.
          The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959, (73 
          Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to 
          issue a proclamation designating the third week in July of 
          each year as ``Captive Nations Week.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim July 20 through July 26, 
          2003, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon the people of the 
          United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies 
          and activities and to reaffirm their commitment to all those 
          seeking liberty, justice, and self-determination.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          eighteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7692 of July 24, 2003

National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          When North Korean troops invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, 
          the United States took immediate action to defend the freedom 
          of a people unjustly attacked. Leading a coalition of 20 other 
          countries, American and South Korean troops fought to advance 
          liberty and opportunity and to overcome cruelty and 
          repression. More than 1.7 million Americans faced forbidding 
          terrain and harsh combat in battles such as Pork Chop Hill, 
          Heartbreak Ridge, the Pusan Perimeter, and the Chosin 
          Reservoir. Throughout the conflict, the members of our Armed 
          Forces demonstrated extraordinary honor, skill, and courage.
          The Military Armistice Agreement of July 27, 1953, ended 3 
          years of bitter warfare on the Korean Peninsula and stopped 
          the spread of Communism in Korea, signaling to the world 
          America's resolve to stand against tyranny and totalitarian 
          regimes. Fifty years later, our Nation remains grateful for 
          the bravery and sacrifice of our Korean War veterans. They 
          defended human freedom, liberated the oppressed, and 
          selflessly protected the democratic ideals that made our 
          Nation strong. Their efforts reflect the honorable and decent 
          spirit of America. More than 34,000 of America's service men 
          and women gave their lives in battle in the Korean War. As we 
          continue our fight to extend freedom today, we remember and 
          honor their sacrifices and those of their families.
          Thanks in large measure to the veterans of the Korean War, 
          South Korea today stands as a shining example of the economic 
          and social benefits of democracy. As we observe the 50th 
          anniversary of the Armistice, America looks forward to the day 
          when the stability of the Korean Peninsula is built on 
          peaceful reconciliation of North and South. We pledge to work 
          with the Republic of Korea to further our shared values of 
          democracy, human rights, and free enterprise. And we will 
          continue to build upon the comprehensive and dynamic 
          relationship between our two nations to promote peace and 
          prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia.
          The Congress, by Public Law 104	19 as amended (36 U.S.C. 127), 
          has designated July 27, 2003, as ``National Korean War 
          Veterans Armistice Day'' and has authorized and requested the 
          President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2003, as 
          National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all 
          Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
          activities that honor and give thanks to our distinguished 
          Korean War veterans. I also ask Federal departments and 
          agencies and interested groups, organizations, and individuals 
          to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff on July 27, 
          2003, in memory of the Americans who died as a result of their 
          service in the Korean War.

[[Page 95]]

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7693 of July 25, 2003

Parents' Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Children are a daily reminder of the blessings and 
          responsibilities of life and a source of joy, pride, and 
          fulfillment. Parents, stepparents, adoptive parents, and 
          foster parents have the important responsibility of providing 
          for, protecting, nurturing, teaching, and loving their 
          children. On Parents' Day, we honor America's mothers and 
          fathers and celebrate the values that bind families from one 
          generation to the next and help define us as a Nation.
          As a child's first teachers, parents are the most influential 
          and effective instructors in a child's life. Through their 
          words, actions, and sacrifices, parents are living examples 
          for children. Young boys and girls watch their parents closely 
          and imitate their behavior. Parents play a critical role in 
          instilling responsibility, integrity, and other life lessons 
          that shape the lives of America's future leaders.
          My Administration is committed to supporting our Nation's 
          families. We are working with faith-based and community 
          organizations to promote healthy marriages, responsible 
          parenting, and education. And we are committed to fully 
          funding and supporting the Promoting Safe and Stable Families 
          Program, which helps strengthen family bonds, promote 
          adoption, and provide help for vulnerable children across our 
          country.
          Volunteer service is one way parents can spend time with their 
          children while encouraging them to learn the value of helping 
          others. The USA Freedom Corps' ``How I Spent My Summer'' 
          initiative includes volunteer opportunities where parents and 
          children can work together to meet the needs of their 
          communities. This initiative offers ideas such as collecting 
          food for local food banks or school supplies for children in 
          need. In addition, families can volunteer at one of our 
          Nation's parks or recreation areas creating trails, assisting 
          with archeological digs, or building and restoring houses. 
          Teaching by example, parents can help their children become 
          responsible citizens.
          Parenting is one of the most rewarding and challenging 
          endeavors in life. On this special day, we recognize the hard 
          work and compassion of America's parents and celebrate the 
          mothers and fathers who are positive role models for their 
          children. I encourage parents to spend more time reading, 
          talking, and volunteering with their children. I also urge 
          parents to share the joys and wisdom of parenthood with new 
          families in their communities and those planning families for 
          the future.

          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by

          with Public Law 103	362, as amended, do hereby proclaim 
          Sunday, July 27, 2003, as Parents' Day. I encourage all 
          Americans to express their respect and appreciation to parents 
          everywhere for their contributions to their children, 
          families, communities, and our Nation. I also call upon 
          citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
          ceremonies, and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-

Proclamation 7694 of July 28, 2003

Death of Bob Hope

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Today, America mourns the loss of one of its great treasures. 
          A gifted comedian who entertained audiences for decades with 
          his unique talents, Bob Hope brought joy and laughter to our 
          Nation. By tirelessly entertaining America's troops, he 
          demonstrated his extraordinary love of country and devotion to 
          the men and women who have served in our military.
          As a mark of respect for the memory of Bob Hope, I hereby 
          order, by the authority vested in me as President of the 
          United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United 
          States of America, that on the day of his interment, the flag 
          of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White 
          House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all 
          military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of 
          the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and 
          throughout the United States and its Territories and 
          possessions until sunset on such day. I also direct that the 
          flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all 
          United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and 
          other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and 
          naval vessels and stations.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          eighth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7695 of August 26, 2003

Women's Equality Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          The 19th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified on August 26, 
          1920, guaranteed the right to vote for American women. Women's 
          Equality Day commemorates this constitutional amendment and is 
          an opportunity for citizens across our country to honor those 
          who took part in the long and difficult struggle for women's 
          suffrage, as well those since 1920 who have continued to fight 
          for equal rights for women.
          Beginning with the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, women's 
          suffrage supporters lectured, wrote, marched, and lobbied for 
          enfranchisement of American women. Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth 
          Cady Stanton, and Lucretia Mott led this movement and 
          advocated an amendment to the Constitution that would 
          guarantee women the right to vote. Through their vision and 
          dedication, these women advanced the fight for equal rights.
          Today, American women are making a difference in their 
          communities and workplaces. Women's accomplishments in 
          education, business, science, art, medicine, athletics, and 
          every other field have made America better and stronger. The 
          courage and determination of American women are exemplified in 
          the personnel serving in our Armed Forces. Women across 
          America are also helping to secure our country by serving as 
          police officers, firefighters, doctors, nurses, paramedics, 
          and first-responders.
          Americans believe in opportunity for all and on this day, we 
          honor the achievements of women who have charted the path to 
          equal opportunity.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim August 26, 2003, as Women's Equality Day. I call upon 
          the people of the United States to observe this day with 
          appropriate programs and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7696 of August 27, 2003

To Extend Duty-Free Treatment for Certain Agricultural Products of Israel

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          1. On April 22, 1985, the United States entered into the 
          Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between 
          the Government of the United States of America and the 
          Government of Israel (FTA), which the Congress approved in the 
          United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 
          1985 (the ``FTA Act'')(19 U.S.C. 2112 Note).
          2. On November 4, 1996, the United States entered into an 
          agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in 
          agricultural products, effective from December 4, 1996, 
          through December 31, 2001 (the ``1996 Agreement''), in order 
          to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
          advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade 
          while acknowledging differing interpretations as to the 
          meaning of certain rights and obligations in the FTA as to 
          such trade.
          3. Section 4(b) of the FTA Act provides that, whenever the 
          President determines that it is necessary to maintain the 
          general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous 
          concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the FTA, 
          the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, 
          modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance 
          of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional 
          duties as the President determines to be required or 
          appropriate to carry out the FTA.
          4. Consistent with section 4(b) of the FTA Act, President 
          Clinton issued Proclamation 6962 of December 2, 1996, to 
          provide to Israel through the close of December 31, 2001, 
          access into the United States customs territory for specified 
          quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel free of 
          duty or certain fees or other import charges, consistent with 
          the 1996 Agreement.
          5. On December 31, 2001, the United States entered into an 
          agreement with Israel to extend the 1996 Agreement through 
          December 31, 2002, in order to allow for additional time to 
          negotiate a successor arrangement to the 1996 Agreement. 
          Consistent with section 4(b) of the FTA Act, I issued 
          Proclamation 7554, of May 3, 2002, to provide to Israel 
          through the close of December 31, 2002, access into the United 
          States customs territory for specified quantities of certain 
          agricultural products of Israel free of duty or certain fees 
          or other import charges. Several rounds of negotiations were 
          held in 2002 but did not result in conclusion of a successor 
          arrangement to the 1996 Agreement.
          6. On December 31, 2002, the 1-year extension of the 1996 
          Agreement expired. In order to allow additional time to 
          conclude negotiations, the United States and Israel each have 
          elected to extend through 2003 the tariff treatment provided 
          for agricultural products in 2002 under the 1996 Agreement. 
          Israel has already extended through 2003 the tariff benefits 
          for United States agricultural imports provided in 2002 under 
          the 1996 Agreement.

[[Page 99]]

          7. Consistent with section 4(b) of the FTA Act, I have 
          determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the 
          general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous 
          concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the FTA, to 
          provide through the close of December 31, 2003, duty-free 
          treatment for specified quantities of certain agricultural 
          products of Israel.
          8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2483) (the 
          ``Trade Act'') authorizes the President to embody in the 
          Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the 
          substance of the relevant provisions of that act, and of other 
          acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, 
          including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of 
          any rate of duty or other import restriction.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including 
          section 4 of the FTA Act and section 604 of the Trade Act, do 
          hereby proclaim:
          (1) In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and 
          mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel 
          provided for by the FTA, and, in particular, to provide duty-
          free treatment for specified quantities of certain 
          agricultural products of Israel, subchapter VIII of chapter 99 
          of the HTS is modified as provided in the Annex to this 
          proclamation.
          (2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive 
          Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this 
          proclamation are superseded to the extent of such 
          inconsistency.
          (3)(a) The modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this 
          proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods that are 
          the product of Israel and are entered, or withdrawn from 
          warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2003, 
          including entries for which the liquidation of duties has not 
          become final under section 514 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
          amended (19 U.S.C. 1514).
          (b) The provisions of subchapter VIII of chapter 99 of the 
          HTS, as modified by the Annex to this proclamation, shall 
          continue in effect through the close of December 31, 2003.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          seventh day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7697 of August 28, 2003

Family Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Children thrive in loving families where they are taught, 
          nurtured, and comforted. By spending time with our children 
          and stressing the importance of making the right choices, 
          parents and other family members help them develop into 
          confident, successful individuals.
          Families can help secure a healthy tomorrow for their children 
          by providing guidance, staying involved, and serving as role 
          models. I am committed to supporting strong families and 
          strong marriages to help ensure that every child grows up in a 
          safe, loving family. Statistics show that children from two-
          parent families are less likely to end up in poverty, drop out 
          of school, become addicted to drugs, have a child out of 
          wedlock, suffer abuse, or become a violent criminal. Because 
          stable families should be the central goal of American welfare 
          policy, I have proposed spending up to $300 million a year to 
          find the most effective programs to strengthen marriage.
          Parents play a critical role in discouraging harmful behavior 
          such as experimenting with alcohol, drugs, and tobacco. 
          Research shows that teens often listen to their parents when 
          it comes to decisions about harmful substances and risky 
          behaviors. Regular family activities provide opportunities for 
          parents to communicate important messages and enhance their 
          relationships with their children. Recent studies from the 
          National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia 
          University found that teens from families who eat dinner 
          together were less likely to use illegal drugs, alcohol, and 
          cigarettes, while teenagers who rarely eat dinner with their 
          parents were more likely to engage in these unhealthy 
          activities.
          Families and all Americans can act together to educate our 
          youth about the dangers of drugs and alcohol and help them 
          grow into healthy, responsible,

[[Page 101]]

          compassionate citizens. In order to ensure a brighter future 
          for our Nation, and safe, healthy, and happy lives for our 
          children, our children must learn that avoiding harmful 
          substances is an ongoing responsibility. As we work to educate 
          our next generation about making healthy choices, we renew our 
          commitment to the American family.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim September 22, 2003, as Family Day. I call upon the 
          people of the United States to observe this day by engaging in 
          activities to strengthen the relationships between parents and 
          children and help fight against substance abuse and risky 
          behaviors.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          eighth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7698 of September 1, 2003

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Alcohol addiction and drug addiction continue to challenge our 
          Nation. Addiction to alcohol or drugs destroys family ties, 
          friendship, ambition, and moral conviction, and reduces the 
          richness of life to a single destructive desire. During 
          National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we seek to 
          remind all Americans, particularly those who struggle with 
          alcohol or drug addiction, that recovery is possible. This 
          year's theme, ``Join the Voices of Recovery: Celebrating 
          Health,'' salutes the thousands of Americans currently 
          striving to address their alcohol or drug addiction, and the 
          many professionals, volunteers, clergy, community groups, 
          friends, and family members who support others in overcoming 
          addiction.
          For the addicted, the fight is an ongoing struggle for their 
          own lives. The process of treatment and recovery is personal, 
          and each individual's treatment needs are different. And as a 
          result, treatment programs must address a wide range of 
          physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs. When 
          properly tailored, alcohol and drug addiction treatment can be 
          very effective.
          Last year, approximately 100,000 individuals who sought 
          treatment for alcohol and drug addiction were unable to 
          receive the help they needed. To address this problem, I have 
          proposed a new initiative, Access to Recovery, that will 
          increase the availability and effectiveness of treatment 
          programs. With $600 million, an additional 300,000 Americans 
          will gain access to needed treatment over the next 3 years.
          Access to Recovery will build on existing alcohol and drug 
          treatment services by offering greater choices to those 
          seeking treatment. Our Nation is blessed with many recovery 
          programs that do exceptional work, and we

[[Page 102]]

          must make these programs available to more people. By 
          providing vouchers that enable those struggling with addiction 
          to get help from a wide range of sources that work, including 
          faith-based and community organizations, we will expand 
          treatment options and accountability. This flexibility will 
          strengthen our system and offer more hope to those in need.
          My Administration has taken important steps to cut off illegal 
          drug supplies and reduce demand through anti-drug education. 
          For those who become addicted to drugs or to alcohol, my 
          Administration is committed to tearing down the stigma 
          attached to recovery so that more people will seek the help 
          they need. Alcohol addiction and drug addiction are diseases 
          that touch all Americans_young and old, rich and poor, male 
          and female. As a Nation, we must continue our efforts to offer 
          the best possible opportunities, settings, and approaches to 
          prevent and treat alcohol and drug addiction. By caring for 
          those who need treatment, we are building a more welcoming and 
          compassionate culture that values every life.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim September 2003 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction 
          Recovery Month. I call upon all the people of the United 
          States to observe this month with appropriate programs, 
          ceremonies, and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day 
          of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7699 of September 1, 2003

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          It is estimated that more than 25,000 American women will be 
          diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year and that more than 
          14,000 will die from this disease. During National Ovarian 
          Cancer Awareness Month, we seek to increase understanding of 
          ovarian cancer and the importance of early detection, and to 
          recognize the advances made to eliminate this disease.
          Early detection and education are critical to treating ovarian 
          cancer. Today, only half of the women diagnosed with this 
          disease are expected to survive 5 years or more. However, the 
          5-year survival rate for those whose cancer is detected early 
          is more than 90 percent. When the disease is discovered in its 
          early stages, doctors are able to treat it with standard 
          methods, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
          Researchers have made significant progress in developing 
          screening tests that can accurately diagnose ovarian cancer. 
          Much work remains, however,

[[Page 103]]

          before we can reliably detect the disease in its earliest 
          stages when treatment is most effective. I urge all women to 
          talk to their doctors about ovarian cancer and the best course 
          of action to detect and treat this deadly disease. Doing so is 
          particularly important for women aged 40 or older, those with 
          a family history of ovarian cancer, and those with a personal 
          history of breast, endometrial, or colon cancer. And I urge 
          individuals across the country to learn more about this 
          disease and what can be done to reduce the number of 
          individuals who suffer from it.
          In addition to encouraging early detection and increasing 
          awareness about ovarian cancer, we must continue to advance 
          our knowledge through research. Scientists at the Centers for 
          Disease Control and Prevention, the National Cancer Institute, 
          the Department of Defense, the Food and Drug Administration, 
          other Federal agencies, and private companies are working hard 
          to discover the causes of ovarian cancer and to design more 
          effective screening and treatment options. Through their 
          research, we hope to learn how to reduce the chances of 
          developing this disease, how to recognize it in its earliest 
          stages, and how to successfully treat women in every stage of 
          ovarian cancer. The vision and determination of these 
          professionals, along with the courage of the women who 
          participate in clinical trials, are helping to turn today's 
          research advances into tomorrow's success stories.
          My Administration remains committed to supporting research 
          efforts to help find a cure for ovarian cancer. My fiscal year 
          2004 budget proposal includes more than $5.6 billion for 
          cancer research at the National Institutes of Health. This 
          investment will lead to a better understanding of ovarian 
          cancer and greater hope for women who suffer from this 
          disease. Through education and continued research, we can win 
          the fight against ovarian cancer and save the lives of 
          thousands of American women.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim September 2003 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness 
          Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
          this month with appropriate programs and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day 
          of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7700 of September 1, 2003

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer among 
          men in the United States. This year alone, it is estimated 
          that more than 220,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be 
          diagnosed and that nearly 29,000 men will die from this 
          disease. During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we 
          seek to increase understanding about the risk factors of 
          prostate

[[Page 104]]

          cancer, the importance of a healthy lifestyle, and the 
          benefits of detecting the disease in its earliest stages, when 
          it is most treatable.
          Although the exact cause of prostate cancer is unknown, 
          several factors have been found to increase the risk of 
          developing this disease. Men aged 65 years or older make up 
          about 70 percent of all diagnosed prostate cancer cases. In 
          addition, a man's risk of developing prostate cancer doubles 
          if a father or brother has been diagnosed with the disease.
          Making healthy choices is critical to prevent prostate cancer 
          and many other diseases. Research suggests that some men may 
          be able to reduce their risk of prostate cancer by eating 
          healthy foods and exercising on a regular basis.
          Early detection is important in successfully treating prostate 
          cancer. Preventative screenings can reveal a man's current 
          health status and identify whether he needs to adjust his diet 
          or behavior. I urge men, particularly those over 50, to learn 
          more about the disease and to talk to their doctors about when 
          to start preventative screening. Healthcare providers can 
          advise men as to which tests are most appropriate. Through 
          early detection and treatment, we can reduce the number of 
          deaths caused by prostate cancer.
          Today, our Nation is on the leading edge of new discoveries. 
          As we continue to make advancements in medicine, my 
          Administration remains committed to learning the causes of 
          prostate cancer and finding a cure. My fiscal year 2004 budget 
          proposal includes more than $13 million for the Centers for 
          Disease Control and Prevention to conduct, support, and 
          promote efforts that increase awareness of screening and early 
          detection, and more than $5.6 billion for cancer research at 
          the National Institutes of Health. Through my HealthierUS 
          Initiative, my Administration is also encouraging all citizens 
          to lead healthier lives by eating right, exercising, and 
          taking advantage of preventative screening. By working 
          together, we will improve our ability to prevent, treat, and 
          cure prostate cancer.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim September 2003 as National Prostate Cancer Awareness 
          Month. I call upon government officials, businesses, 
          communities, healthcare professionals, educators, volunteers, 
          and all people of the United States to reaffirm our Nation's 
          strong and continuing commitment to prevent, treat, and cure 
          prostate cancer.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day 
          of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          As we approach the second anniversary of September 11, 2001, 
          we remember all that we lost as Americans and recognize all 
          that we have witnessed about the character of America. During 
          these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we honor those 
          who were killed and their families, and we ask God for 
          strength and wisdom as we carry out the noble mission that our 
          Nation began that morning.
          The passage of time cannot erase the pain and devastation that 
          were inflicted on our people. We will always remember those 
          who were brutally taken from us. And we ask God to comfort the 
          loved ones left behind; their courage and determination have 
          inspired our Nation.
          We thank God for the unity and compassion Americans have 
          demonstrated since September 11, 2001. The great strength of 
          America is the heart and soul of the American people. And we 
          will continue to help those who are hurting or are in need.
          We pray that God watch over our brave men and women in 
          uniform. We are grateful to them, and to their families, for 
          their service and sacrifice. We pray for peace and ask God for 
          patience and resolve in our war against terror and evil.
          This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It 
          will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim Friday, September 5, through Sunday, September 7, 
          2003, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. I ask that 
          the people of the United States and places of worship mark 
          these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance with memorial 
          services, the ringing of bells, and evening candlelight 
          remembrance vigils. I invite the people of the world to share 
          in these Days of Prayer and Remembrance.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth 
          day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the

Proclamation 7702 of September 4, 2003

Patriot Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Two years ago, more than 3,000 innocent people lost their 
          lives when a calm September morning was shattered by 
          terrorists driven by hatred and destruction.
          On that day, and in its aftermath, we saw the greatness of 
          America in the bravery of victims; in the heroism of first 
          responders who laid down their lives to save others; in the 
          compassion of people who stepped forward to help those they 
          had never met; and in the generosity of millions of Americans 
          who enriched our country with acts of service and kindness. 
          Since that day, we have seen the greatness of America further 
          demonstrated in the courage of our brave men and women in 
          uniform who have served and sacrificed in Afghanistan, in 
          Iraq, and around the world to advance freedom and prevent 
          terrorist attacks on America.
          As we remember September 11, 2001, we reaffirm the vows made 
          in the earliest hours of our grief and anger. As liberty's 
          home and defender, America will not tire, will not falter, and 
          will not fail in fighting for the safety and security of the 
          American people and a world free from terrorism. We will 
          continue to bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to 
          them. This Patriot Day, we hold steady to this task.
          By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 
          107	89), the Congress has designated September 11 of each year 
          as ``Patriot Day.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2003, as 
          Patriot Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
          observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, 
          including remembrance services and candlelight vigils. I also 
          call upon the Governors of the United States and the 
          Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as well as appropriate officials 
          of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown 
          at half-staff on Patriot Day. In addition, I call upon all 
          Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes 
          on that day and to observe a moment of silence beginning at 
          8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the innocent victims 
          who lost their lives as a result of the terrorist attacks of 
          September 11, 2001.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth 
          day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7703 of September 12, 2003

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Historically Black Colleges and Universities have a 
          distinguished past and an important future in providing higher 
          education for Americans throughout our country. As we 
          celebrate National Historically Black Colleges and 
          Universities Week, we recognize these institutions for their 
          dedication to academic excellence. And we reaffirm our 
          Nation's commitment to equal educational opportunities for all 
          Americans.
          Since the mid 1800s, Historically Black Colleges and 
          Universities have provided superb education and training to 
          many Americans. And these schools opened the door to African 
          Americans when other doors were shamefully barred. Since their 
          inception, these schools have furthered the development of 
          young people who went on to become leaders in government, 
          business, education, science, the military, law, and many 
          other fields. Graduates of Historically Black Colleges and 
          Universities have made great contributions to America, and 
          continue to serve as role models for all Americans.
          The struggles and many successes of America's Historically 
          Black Colleges and Universities are the struggles and 
          successes of our Nation. Today, our Nation's 105 Historically 
          Black Colleges and Universities are building on their 
          commitment to excellence and their integral position within 
          our higher education system. Our Nation must continue to 
          support these schools for the sake of our students and our 
          future.
          In 2002, I signed an Executive Order supporting the White 
          House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and 
          Universities to help find new ways to strengthen these 
          schools. My Administration also has sought to increase fiscal 
          year 2004 funding for Historically Black Colleges and 
          Universities by 5 percent, requesting more than $224 million. 
          In addition, the President's Board of Advisors on Historically 
          Black Colleges and Universities is helping these colleges and 
          universities benefit from Federal programs, obtain private-
          sector support for their endowments, and build private-sector 
          partnerships to strengthen faculty development and cooperative 
          research.
          America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities have a 
          proud and storied tradition. America recognizes and salutes 
          their history and achievements and will work for their 
          continued success.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim September 14 through September 20, 2003, as National 
          Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I call upon 
          public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of 
          the United States to observe this week with appropriate 
          ceremonies, activities, and programs as we demonstrate our 
          appreciation for these important institutions and their many 
          successful graduates.

Proclamation 7704 of September 12, 2003

Small Business Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          The success of small businesses in America reflects the 
          innovation, determination, and hard work of the American 
          people. During Small Business Week, we celebrate the 
          entrepreneurs and business people who create goods, services, 
          and jobs, and bring opportunity and economic prosperity to 
          communities throughout our country. We also reaffirm our 
          commitment to helping more small business owners and their 
          employees realize the American Dream.
          Small businesses create the majority of new jobs in our Nation 
          and account for more than half of the output of our economy. 
          They lead the way in generating new ideas and creating new 
          technologies, goods, and services for our country and for the 
          world.
          Small businesses also reflect the diversity of America. Nearly 
          40 percent of small companies in the United States are owned 
          by women. There are also more than 3 million minority-owned 
          small businesses across the country.
          Because small businesses are vital to our Nation's prosperity 
          and reflect the hard work of the American people, my 
          Administration has taken important steps to assist small 
          businesses and the people they employ. We have reduced taxes, 
          encouraged investment, and removed obstacles to growth. The 
          Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 I signed 
          into law will provide 23 million small business owners with 
          tax cuts averaging more than $2,200 each. The Act also 
          quadrupled the amount that small businesses can expense for 
          new capital investments, encouraging new investment in 
          technology, machinery, and other equipment. This new 
          technology and equipment will increase productivity and create 
          new jobs, thereby contributing to the overall strength of our 
          economy.
          We are also seeking to permanently eliminate the death tax. 
          With the repeal of this tax, small business men and women will 
          be able to pass their life's work to the next generation 
          without having to pay a punitive tax that in many cases forces 
          the sale of the business or many of its assets. And I support 
          legislation that would make it easier for small businesses to 
          offer health coverage options to their employees. Through 
          Association Health Plans, small businesses could pool together 
          to offer group plans to all of their employees, like those 
          available to large businesses. In addition, we are working to 
          streamline small business regulations and paperwork. To this

[[Page 109]]

          end, I issued an Executive Order that requires all Federal 
          regulatory agencies to minimize these burdens on our Nation's 
          small businesses.
          The Small Business Administration (SBA), which helps American 
          innovators and risk-takers launch and build their businesses, 
          celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. By helping small 
          businesses succeed, the SBA continues to strengthen America.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim September 14 through September 20, 2003, as Small 
          Business Week. I call upon all the people of the United States 
          to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, 
          and programs that celebrate the achievements of small business 
          owners and their employees and encourage and foster the 
          development of new small businesses.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth 
          day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the

Citizenship Day and Constitution Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          In the summer of 1787, representatives from the States met in 
          Philadelphia to establish a new Constitution that would unite 
          America. They intended the Constitution to achieve six 
          purposes: ``to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, 
          insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, 
          promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of 
          Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.'' Their work was 
          successful and enduring. For more than two centuries, the 
          American people have honored the foresight and wisdom of the 
          Framers by respecting and defending our Constitution.
          Our Constitution and our country have grown stronger over the 
          last 216 years_through wars, searing internal conflicts, and 
          great social, economic, and technological change. In the last 
          2 years, America has again been tested, this time by terrorist 
          attacks designed to strike at our people, our institutions, 
          and our constitutional government. In the wake of those 
          attacks, we have renewed and strengthened our commitment to a 
          more perfect Union and common defense, to justice and domestic 
          tranquility, to the general welfare and the blessings of 
          liberty.
          On Citizenship Day and during Constitution Week, we remember 
          those who have fought and those who have died to preserve, 
          protect, and defend the Constitution. We recall and reiterate 
          the vow of President Abraham Lincoln that these ``dead shall 
          not have died in vain_that this Nation, under

[[Page 110]]

          God, shall have a new birth of freedom_and that government of 
          the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish 
          from the earth.''
          In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in 
          recognition of the Americans who strive to uphold the duties 
          and responsibilities of citizenship, the Congress, by joint 
          resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 106, as amended), 
          designated September 17 as ``Citizenship Day,'' and by joint 
          resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 108, as amended), 
          requested that the President proclaim the week beginning 
          September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as 
          ``Constitution Week.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2003, as 
          Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2003, 
          as Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local 
          officials, as well as leaders of civic, social, and 
          educational organizations, to conduct ceremonies and programs 
          to celebrate our Constitution and reaffirm our commitment as 
          citizens to this great Nation.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth 
          day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand three,

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          America's diversity has always been a great strength of our 
          Nation. As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, we 
          recognize and applaud the extraordinary accomplishments of 
          Hispanic Americans.
          From America's beginning, Hispanic Americans have served as 
          leaders in business, government, law, science, athletics, the 
          arts, and many other fields. In 1822, Joseph Marion 
          Hern[aacute]ndez became the first Hispanic to serve as a 
          member of the United States Congress, representing the newly 
          established territory of Florida. Businessman Roberto 
          Goizueta, a refugee from Cuba who rose to become the CEO of 
          one of America's largest corporations, is an inspiring example 
          of what immigrants to America can achieve through hard work 
          and character. Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Roberto 
          Clemente's athletic skills, generosity, and charity made him a 
          legend on and off the baseball field. Through memorable 
          recordings and performances, singer Celia Cruz celebrated her 
          heritage and helped introduce salsa music to the United

          Hispanic Americans have sacrificed in defense of this Nation's 
          freedom, serving in every major American conflict. More than 
          three dozen Hispanic Americans have earned the Medal of Honor. 
          Today, more than 125,000 Hispanic Americans serve in the Armed 
          Forces, approximately 9 percent of

          our active-duty military. As we work to advance peace, 
          freedom, and opportunity abroad, we are grateful to all of the 
          brave men and women who serve our Nation, and to their 
          families.
          During Hispanic Heritage Month, I join with all Americans in 
          recognizing the many contributions of Hispanic Americans to 
          the United States, and in celebrating Hispanic heritage and 
          culture. To honor the achievements of Hispanic Americans, the 
          Congress, by Public Law 100	402 as amended, has authorized and 
          requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
          designating September 15 through October 15, as ``National 
          Hispanic Heritage Month.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through 
          October 15, 2003, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call 
          upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the 
          people of the United States to observe this month with 
          appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          seventeenth day of September, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States 
          of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7707 of September 18, 2003

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          The sacrifice and service of America's veterans, including 
          those who became prisoners of war or who went missing in 
          action, have preserved freedom for America and brought freedom 
          to millions around the world. On National POW/MIA Recognition 
          Day, we honor the extraordinary courage of the Americans who 
          have been prisoners of war, and we pray for those who are 
          still missing in action and unaccounted for. This Nation also 
          remembers the challenges and heartache endured by the families 
          of prisoners of war and missing in action. We seek answers for 
          the families of those who are still missing, and we will not 
          rest until we have a full accounting.
          To mark this important day, on September 19, 2003, the flag of 
          the National League of Families of American Prisoners and 
          Missing in Southeast Asia will again be flown over the White 
          House, the Capitol, the Departments of State, Defense, and 
          Veterans Affairs, the Selective Service System Headquarters, 
          the National Vietnam Veterans and Korean War Veterans 
          Memorials, U.S. military installations, national cemeteries, 
          and other locations across our country. We raise this flag as 
          a reminder and a promise. The black-and-white flag is a symbol 
          that these missing Americans will not be forgotten, and is 
          flown as a testament to our Government's unwavering commitment 
          to pursue the fullest possible accounting for all our missing 
          in action service members.

Proclamation 7708 of September 25, 2003

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Almost half of the land in the United States is used for 
          agricultural production, and our Nation depends on our hard-
          working farm and ranch families for food, fiber, and the good 
          stewardship of our environment. As we celebrate National Farm 
          Safety and Health Week, we give thanks for their dedication, 
          sacrifice, and contributions to our country, and we renew our 
          commitment to the health and livelihoods of American farm and 
          ranch families.
          America must continue to promote the safety of our farmers and 
          ranchers. Farming and ranching can be dangerous work; in 2002, 
          the agriculture industry had the second-highest rate of deaths 
          due to accidents. Proper education and training are critical 
          to protecting the safety of farmers and ranchers. By working 
          together to encourage careful use of equipment and facilities, 
          America helps our farm and ranch families remain healthy and 
          more productive than any other farmers in the world.
          This year's theme for National Farm Safety and Health Week, 
          ``Secure Your Farming through Safety and Health,'' also 
          encourages farmers and ranchers to focus on farm security 
          issues. Farm and ranching communities play a vital role in 
          protecting America's food supplies, water resources, and farm 
          chemicals. Their efforts are important to the safety and 
          security of our citizens.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim September 21 through September 27, 2003, as National 
          Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon the agencies, 
          organizations, and businesses that serve America's 
          agricultural workers to strengthen their commitment to 
          promoting farm safety and

[[Page 113]]

          health programs. I also urge all Americans to honor our 
          agricultural heritage and to recognize our farmers and 
          ranchers for their remarkable contributions to our Nation's 
          vitality and prosperity.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7709 of September 25, 2003

Gold Star Mother's Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          As members of America's Armed Forces now protect our country 
          by engaging the enemies of freedom in Iraq, in Afghanistan, 
          and on other fronts in the war against terrorism, they carry 
          on a noble legacy. Today, Americans and millions around the 
          world enjoy freedom because of the service and sacrifice of 
          our military men and women.
          The cost of America's freedom is often personal. Few pay more 
          dearly than our Gold Star Mothers, who have endured the death 
          of a son or daughter in service to our country.
          More than 75 years ago, one mother's determination to 
          transform her personal loss into good works led to the 
          creation of the American Gold Star Mothers. After receiving 
          notice of her son's death in aerial combat during World War I, 
          Grace Darling Seibold devoted her energy to volunteering in a 
          local hospital. She began reaching out to other mothers whose 
          sons had died in military service to the Nation. She organized 
          a group of these special mothers to help them comfort each 
          other and care for hospitalized veterans. Their organization 
          was named after the gold star service flag that families hung 
          in their windows in honor of family members who had died in 
          military service. After years of planning, it became a 
          national organization in 1928. Since then, brave women have 
          continued to come together as Gold Star Mothers to ease the 
          burden of their loss and to serve others.
          Today, numerous chapters of Gold Star Mothers across our 
          Nation offer important programs and services to enhance the 
          lives of veterans and provide support for their families. 
          Their civic education programs and help for those in need 
          honor the lives of their sons and daughters and strengthen 
          America.
          The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 
          (49 Stat. 1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in 
          September as ``Gold Star Mother's Day,'' and has authorized 
          and requested the President to issue a proclamation in 
          observance of this day.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 28, 
          2003, as Gold Star Mother's Day. I call upon all Government 
          officials to display the flag of the

[[Page 114]]

          United States over Government buildings on this solemn day. I 
          also encourage the American people to display the flag and 
          hold appropriate meetings in their homes, places of worship, 
          or other suitable places as a public expression of the 
          sympathy and respect that our Nation holds for our Gold Star 
          Mothers.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America

Proclamation 7710 of September 26, 2003

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          America's more than 3 million minority-owned businesses 
          represent one of the fastest-growing segments of our Nation's 
          economy. Through skill, hard work, and determination, these 
          businesses are strengthening our Nation and our economy. 
          During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we recognize 
          these businesses, their owners, and their employees for their 
          commitment to free enterprise and equal opportunity.
          Most businesses in America_including those that are minority-
          owned_are small businesses. Small businesses are a path to the 
          American Dream and must be accessible to all of our citizens. 
          Through the Department of Commerce's Minority Business 
          Development Agency and the Small Business Administration, we 
          are promoting both the growth of minority-owned businesses and 
          equal access to Federal contracts, capital, and management and 
          technical assistance.
          Small businesses also create most of the new jobs in our 
          economy, and my Administration is acting to create an 
          environment where small businesses grow and thrive. On May 28, 
          I signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 
          2003, allowing entrepreneurs to keep more of their hard-earned 
          money. My Administration is also pursuing an ambitious trade 
          agenda. This year, I signed legislation implementing Free 
          Trade Agreements with Chile and Singapore. These new Free 
          Trade Agreements, and others that my Administration is 
          seeking, not only will provide cheaper goods for consumers, 
          but also will create new high-wage jobs for American workers.
          I encourage all Americans to recognize the strength and 
          importance of our country's minority entrepreneurs and their 
          employees. The talents, skills, and dedication of these 
          citizens enrich our communities, and we honor their 
          contributions to our Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim September 28 through October 4, 2003, as Minority 
          Enterprise Development Week. I encourage all

[[Page 115]]

          Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
          ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions 
          of our Nation's minority enterprises.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          six day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America

Proclamation 7711 of October 3, 2003

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Breast cancer touches the lives of many Americans, either 
          directly or through the diagnosis of a family member or 
          friend. We have made considerable progress in diagnosing this 
          disease and improving treatments, but we have not ended it. 
          While overall death rates are declining, breast cancer remains 
          the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. During 
          this 19th annual National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we 
          recognize the efforts being made to fight breast cancer 
          through prevention, early detection, and aggressive research 
          into new treatments and therapies.
          Monthly self exams and mammograms are still the best ways to 
          detect breast cancer at an early, treatable stage. The 
          National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the United States 
          Preventive Services Task Force agree that for women who are 40 
          or over, a mammogram every 1 to 2 years can greatly reduce the 
          risk of dying from breast cancer. I encourage all women to 
          consult with their physicians to obtain appropriate screenings 
          to help with early detection.
          This year in the United States, an estimated 212,000 
          individuals will be diagnosed with breast cancer and an 
          estimated 40,000 will die of the disease. My Administration is 
          committed to building on the research that has already 
          advanced our knowledge of the causes of and possible cures for 
          breast cancer. The NCI invested an estimated $564.6 million 
          this year in breast cancer research and will spend 
          approximately $584 million next year. Continued research 
          provides the opportunity to better understand the causes of 
          breast cancer and how we can better prevent, detect, and treat 
          it. The United States Postal Service is also helping with the 
          fight. Proceeds from the Postal Service's Breast Cancer 
          Awareness stamp go to breast cancer research. Since the launch 
          of this special stamp, more than $33 million has been raised 
          to help search for a cure.
          I urge all Americans to raise awareness of breast cancer by 
          talking with family members and friends about the importance 
          of screening and early detection. By educating ourselves and 
          working together, we will improve our ability to prevent, 
          detect, treat, and ultimately cure breast cancer.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and

[[Page 116]]

          laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the month of 
          October 2003 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I call 
          upon Government officials, businesses, communities, healthcare 
          professionals, educators, volunteers, and all the people of 
          the United States to continue our Nation's strong commitment 
          to controlling and curing breast cancer.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day 
          of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7712 of October 3, 2003

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          For Americans with disabilities, employment is vital to 
          independence, empowerment, and quality of life. During 
          National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we recognize 
          the many contributions citizens with disabilities make to our 
          society, and we reaffirm our commitment to helping them 
          achieve their full inclusion in our workforce.
          Today, Americans with disabilities enjoy improved access to 
          education, government services, public accommodations, 
          transportation, telecommunications, and employment 
          opportunities. The landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 
          1990 (ADA) removed barriers and enabled many individuals with 
          disabilities to find more opportunities to use their gifts and 
          talents in the workplace. This progress has made our Nation 
          stronger, more productive, and more just. People with 
          disabilities still encounter challenges, however, to their 
          full participation in American society.
          In February 2001, I launched the New Freedom Initiative to 
          address these challenges, to fulfill the promises of the ADA, 
          and to move toward an America where all our citizens live and 
          work with dignity and freedom. This comprehensive plan is 
          helping Americans with disabilities learn and develop skills, 
          engage in productive work, make choices about their daily 
          lives, and participate fully in their communities.
          A key component of the New Freedom Initiative is our 
          commitment to integrate individuals with disabilities into the 
          workforce. We have made substantial progress toward this goal. 
          The Department of Justice has established an ADA Business 
          Connection, a series of meetings between representatives of 
          the business and disability communities to open dialogue that 
          will promote greater understanding and increased voluntary 
          compliance with the ADA. Also, the Department of Health and 
          Human Services and the Social Security Administration are 
          implementing the landmark ``Ticket to Work'' program that 
          makes it possible for millions of Americans with disabilities 
          to no longer have to choose between having a job and receiving 
          health care. And the Department of Labor has established two 
          national technical assistance centers on workforce and 
          disability that offer

[[Page 117]]

          training, technical assistance, and information to improve 
          access for all in the workforce development system.
          By working together to open doors of opportunity for citizens 
          with disabilities, we can help fulfill the promise of our 
          great Nation.
          To recognize the contributions of Americans with disabilities 
          and to encourage all citizens to help ensure their full 
          inclusion in the workforce, the Congress, by joint resolution 
          approved August 11, 1945, as amended (36 U.S.C. 121), has 
          designated October of each year as ``National Disability 
          Employment Awareness Month.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim October 2003 as National 
          Disability Employment Awareness Month. I call upon government 
          officials, labor leaders, employers, and all the people of the 
          United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, 
          ceremonies, and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day 
          of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two

Proclamation 7713 of October 3, 2003

Fire Prevention Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          More than 1.7 million fires strike American homes, parks, and 
          businesses each year. This devastation costs lives, causes 
          injuries, ruins property, and disrupts businesses. While fires 
          are powerful and destructive, many fires are preventable. 
          During Fire Prevention Week, we join with our Nation's first 
          responders to help prevent fires and ensure the safety of our 
          homes and communities.
          As the official sponsor of Fire Prevention Week, the National 
          Fire Protection Association is joining forces with the 
          Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management 
          Agency and the United States Fire Administration to emphasize 
          the importance of being prepared to protect ourselves, our 
          families, and our communities. This year's Fire Prevention 
          Week theme is ``When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!''
          Across our country, most fire-related deaths occur where 
          people feel safest_in their own homes. National surveys reveal 
          that most Americans underestimate the risk of fire in their 
          homes and lack an emergency response plan. Fires can grow 
          quickly, and individuals may have as few as 2 minutes to 
          evacuate. Working smoke detectors give people more time to 
          escape fires. At least 94 percent of American homes are 
          equipped with smoke alarms, yet most home fire deaths happen 
          in homes where smoke alarms are not working. By installing and 
          maintaining working smoke alarms on every level of the home, 
          having a fire emergency response plan,

[[Page 118]]

          and evacuating if the alarm sounds, families and individuals 
          can be ready to respond to a fire.
          This week also reminds us of the dangers that brave first 
          responders face as they risk their lives to fight fires and 
          protect our communities, our people, and our natural 
          resources. Our fire services respond to more than 20 million

          courage, skill, and commitment to public safety, and we honor 
          the sacrifice of those who have been injured or killed in 
          their efforts to protect us. Through fire safety and

          all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen 
          Firefighters Memorial Service. I urge all Americans to protect 
          their homes by installing smoke detectors where needed and 
          regularly checking their existing smoke detectors. These small 
          efforts will help make our communities safer for all.

Proclamation 7714 of October 3, 2003

Marriage Protection Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Marriage is a sacred institution, and its protection is 
          essential to the continued strength of our society. Marriage 
          Protection Week provides an opportunity to focus our efforts 
          on preserving the sanctity of marriage and on building strong 
          and healthy marriages in America.
          Marriage is a union between a man and a woman, and my 
          Administration is working to support the institution of 
          marriage by helping couples build successful marriages and be 
          good parents.
          To encourage marriage and promote the well-being of children, 
          I have proposed a healthy marriage initiative to help couples 
          develop the skills and knowledge to form and sustain healthy 
          marriages. Research has shown that, on average, children 
          raised in households headed by married parents fare better 
          than children who grow up in other family structures. Through 
          education and counseling programs, faith-based, community, and 
          government organizations promote healthy marriages and a 
          better quality of life for children. By supporting responsible 
          child-rearing and strong families, my Administration is 
          seeking to ensure that every child can grow up in a safe and 
          loving home.

[[Page 119]]

          We are also working to make sure that the Federal Government 
          does not penalize marriage. My tax relief package eliminated 
          the marriage penalty. And as part of the welfare reform 
          package I have proposed, we will do away with the rules that 
          have made it more difficult for married couples to move out of 
          poverty.
          We must support the institution of marriage and help parents 
          build stronger families. And we must continue our work to 
          create a compassionate, welcoming society, where all people 
          are treated with dignity and respect.
          During Marriage Protection Week, I call on all Americans to 
          join me in expressing support for the institution of marriage 
          with all its benefits to our people, our culture, and our 
          society.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim the week of October 12 through October 18, 2003, as 
          Marriage Protection Week. I call upon the people of the United 
          States to observe this week with appropriate programs, 
          activities, and ceremonies.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day 
          of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7715 of October 3, 2003

German-American Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          German-American Day celebrates more than 300 years of German 
          immigration to our shores, beginning with the arrival of 13 
          Mennonite families from Krefeld on October 6, 1683. Seeking a 
          new life of freedom and opportunity, these immigrants settled 
          in Pennsylvania and founded Germantown near the city of 
          Philadelphia. On this day, we recognize the contributions of 
          those German pioneers, and millions of other German-American 
          immigrants and their descendants, to the life and culture of 
          our great Nation.
          As one of the largest ethnic groups in the United States, 
          German Americans have greatly influenced our country in the 
          fields of business, government, law, science, athletics, the 
          arts, and many others. Henry Engelhard Steinway and his sons 
          founded Steinway & Sons in 1853. The 300,000th Steinway piano, 
          the ``golden grand,'' was presented to President Franklin 
          Roosevelt in 1938, and is still on display at the White House. 
          John Augustus Roebling and his son pioneered the development 
          of suspension bridges and wire cable. Their construction of 
          the Brooklyn Bridge is a lasting landmark to their skill, 
          determination, and innovation. And entrepreneurs such as John 
          Davison Rockefeller, John Wanamaker, and Milton Snavely 
          Hershey helped to strengthen the American economy and inspire 
          others to reach for the American Dream.

[[Page 120]]

          In addition to their many professional achievements, German 
          Americans have influenced American culture. From Christmas 
          trees to kindergartens, the United States has adopted many 
          German traditions and institutions. By celebrating and sharing 
          their customs and traditions, German Americans help to 
          preserve their rich heritage and enhance the cultural 
          diversity of our Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim October 6, 2003, as German-American Day. I encourage 
          all Americans to recognize the contributions to the liberty 
          and prosperity of the United States of our citizens of German 
          descent.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day 
          of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-eighth.

Child Health Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America



          Parents, teachers, and mentors play a critical role in helping 
          children learn to make healthy choices in life. On Child 
          Health Day, we emphasize our commitment to teaching our 
          children the benefits of good health.
          The safety and well-being of our children is a priority shared 
          by all Americans. As children grow and develop, they face many 
          risks and dangers. Through the HealthierUS Initiative and the 
          President's Challenge, my Administration is working to help 
          children learn the benefits of a healthy body and mind.
          Across our country, parents and caregivers can play a vital 
          part in creating a more healthy America by teaching children 
          good nutrition and important safety procedures. We can all 
          help young Americans improve their health by encouraging them 
          to eat healthy foods and to get regular exercise. Good 
          nutrition can improve students' ability to concentrate and 
          help them succeed in the classroom. Families must encourage 
          our young people to avoid harmful activities. Families can 
          also protect their children by ensuring that they are 
          immunized against preventable diseases and making sure that 
          homes, day care centers, and schools have been checked for 
          potential hazards. Parents can help prevent accidents and 
          injuries by securing infants, toddlers, and small children in 
          child safety seats and booster seats, checking consumer safety 
          warnings, and making sure young people wear protective gear 
          during recreational activities.
          By teaching our children to make safe, healthy decisions, 
          families and all Americans can help our young people reach 
          their full potential, become responsible leaders in their 
          communities, and make our Nation better.

          The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as 
          amended (36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the 
          first Monday in October as ``Child Health Day'' and has 
          requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance 
          of this day.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 6, 2003, 
          as Child Health Day. I call upon families, schools, child

Proclamation 7717 of October 8, 2003

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Across our country, domestic violence traumatizes victims, 
          endangers children, harms families, and threatens communities. 
          According to the most recent report from the Department of 
          Justice, there were almost 700,000 incidents of domestic 
          violence in 2001. Approximately one-third of women who are 
          murdered each year are killed by their current or former 
          husband or partner. Children who are subjected to domestic 
          violence too often grow up to inflict violence on others, 
          creating a cycle of violence that must be stopped. During 
          National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we renew our 
          Nation's commitment to prevent and punish the perpetrators of 
          this despicable crime and bring hope and healing to those 
          affected by it.
          In some communities across our country, law enforcement, 
          medical, and legal services for domestic violence victims are 
          fragmented, requiring victims to travel to several different 
          places to receive the help and treatment they need. 
          Comprehensive service centers for domestic violence victims 
          and their dependents enable health and justice professionals 
          to better serve those in need. My Administration supports 
          efforts to provide a wide variety of victim services in one 
          location, including medical care, counseling and social 
          services, law enforcement and legal resources, faith-based 
          services, employment assistance, and housing assistance.
          Local nonprofit and faith-based programs and their volunteers 
          also offer critical assistance and support to victims in need_
          help that may not otherwise be available. In August of this 
          year, the dedicated advocates at the Federally supported 
          National Domestic Violence Hotline answered their one 
          millionth call for help. Volunteers who want to help victims 
          in the local community can find more information at the USA 
          Freedom Corps Volunteer Network (located at 
          www.usafreedomcorps.gov).
          My Administration is fighting domestic violence and 
          strengthening services for victims and their dependents by 
          supporting local and private efforts

[[Page 122]]

          and securing historic levels of funding for the Violence 
          Against Women programs at the Department of Justice. In fiscal 
          year 2002, we spent $390 million to prevent domestic violence 
          and help victims, which represented an approximately $100 
          million increase in funding. Since then, we have continued to 
          provide a similar level of funding, and cities and towns 
          across America are using this money to strengthen their 
          responses to the victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, 
          and stalking. The Federal commitment to domestic violence has 
          made it possible for women to seek relief from abuse and 
          reclaim their dignity and their lives. Moreover, Federal 
          prosecutions in cases involving violence against women 
          increased by 35 percent in 2002.
          Today is the first day of issue for the U.S. Postal Service 
          Stop Family Violence postage stamp, which will raise money to 
          support the national fight against domestic violence. On 
          behalf of families and communities across America, I call on 
          all citizens to help raise public awareness about how to 
          prevent, recognize, and stop domestic violence. I applaud the 
          commitment of all those who are helping to improve the lives 
          of domestic violence survivors and their families. Working 
          together, we can continue to find better solutions to this 
          national problem.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim October 2003 as National Domestic Violence Awareness 
          Month. I urge all Americans to help victims of domestic 
          violence and to work together to address this tragic problem.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth 
          day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the

Proclamation 7718 of October 9, 2003

Leif Erikson Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Traveling across the Atlantic as the first Nordic to lead an 
          expedition to North America, Leif Erikson showed great courage 
          in the face of danger. His actions marked the beginning of a 
          longstanding exchange of people, ideas, and innovations 
          between North America and the Nordic nations of Denmark, 
          Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. As the United States 
          celebrates Leif Erikson Day, we honor his historic voyage and 
          give thanks for the many contributions of Nordic Americans to 
          our Nation, and of our Nordic allies.
          Since Leif Erikson's voyage, millions of immigrants from the 
          Nordic countries have come to America. As teachers, lawyers, 
          judges, doctors, authors, athletes, artists, scientists, and 
          business people, and in many other occupations, Nordic 
          Americans have contributed to America's cultural, political,

[[Page 123]]

          and economic strength. America has also benefited from the 
          diplomatic relationships we have long enjoyed with the Nordic 
          nations.
          To honor Leif Erikson, Nordic-American heritage, and America's 
          continued relationship with Nordic countries, the Congress, by 
          joint resolution (Public Law 88	566) approved on September 2, 
          1964, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim 
          October 9 of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2003, as Leif 
          Erikson Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day 
          with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to honor 
          our rich Nordic-American heritage.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day 
          of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of 
          the Independence of the United States of America the two

National School Lunch Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Over the last 57 years, the National School Lunch Program has 
          provided more than 187 billion meals to young people across 
          our country. During National School Lunch Week, we recognize 
          the importance that good nutrition plays in the health of our 
          children and in the development of good eating habits and 
          healthy lifestyles.
          By helping our children make healthy choices not only about 
          food but also about their overall well-being, we can reduce 
          the rates of childhood obesity and diabetes and help prevent 
          heart disease, stroke, and other diseases later in life. 
          Nutritious meals can also improve students' concentration and 
          help them succeed in school.
          As part of the National School Lunch Program, the Department 
          of Agriculture's Team Nutrition advises school food service 
          professionals on how to prepare healthy meals for children. 
          Team Nutrition also provides nutrition programs for children, 
          families, and communities to illustrate the link between diet 
          and health. Today, more than 99,000 schools and childcare 
          centers are educating young people about good eating habits. 
          They are also helping to feed our Nation's needy children 
          through the National School Lunch Program. For many students, 
          low-cost or free school meals are sometimes the only 
          nutritious food they eat. Over the years, the dedication of 
          school officials, food service professionals, parents, and 
          community leaders has helped to expand the National School 
          Lunch Program to include breakfast, after-school snacks, milk 
          breaks, and summer food programs.
          In recognition of the contributions of the National School 
          Lunch Program to the health, education, and well-being of 
          America's children, the Congress, by joint resolution of 
          October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87	780), as

[[Page 124]]

          amended, has designated the week beginning on the second 
          Sunday in October of each year as ``National School Lunch 
          Week'' and has requested the President to issue a proclamation 
          in observance of this week.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim October 12 through 
          October 18, 2003, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon 
          all Americans to join the dedicated individuals who administer 
          the National School Lunch Program at the State and local 
          levels in appropriate activities to promote programs that 
          support the health and well-being of our Nation's children.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day 
          of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of

Proclamation 7720 of October 10, 2003

Columbus Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          When Christopher Columbus set out from Spain in August 1492, 
          he launched an era of discovery and exploration that continues 
          today. On Columbus Day, we honor this Italian explorer's 
          courage and vision, and recognize his four journeys to the 
          ``New World.''
          One of the first known celebrations of Christopher Columbus' 
          achievements was in 1792 when a ceremony in New York City 
          celebrated the 300th anniversary of his landing in the 
          Bahamas. Italian Americans began regularly honoring Columbus 
          in the 1860s. In 1892, President Benjamin Harrison issued a 
          Presidential proclamation on the 400th anniversary of 
          Columbus' first voyage, describing Columbus as ``the pioneer 
          of progress and enlightenment.'' The United States now 
          celebrates a national holiday in honor of Columbus.
          Columbus' willingness to sacrifice the comfort of his home to 
          pursue the unknown has inspired generations of daring 
          explorers. Through the years, Americans have followed in the 
          spirit of Columbus through exploration of land, sea, and 
          space, and are fulfilling Columbus' great legacy. Since the 
          days of Columbus, millions of Italian immigrants have crossed 
          the ocean and come to the United States. These Italian 
          Americans and their descendants have made America stronger and 
          better.
          In commemoration of Columbus' journey, the Congress, by joint 
          resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 
          107), as amended, has requested that the President proclaim 
          the second Monday of October of each year as ``Columbus Day.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim October 13, 2003, as 
          Columbus Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
          observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I 
          also direct that the flag of the United States be

[[Page 125]]

          displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in 
          honor of Christopher Columbus.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day 
          of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and of

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski sacrificed his life on 
          October 11, 1779, for America's independence and the universal 
          cause of freedom. His bravery in supporting the American 
          Revolutionary War is an inspiration to individuals around the 
          world who pursue peace and freedom for all.
          Growing up near Warsaw, Casimir Pulaski knew firsthand the 
          horror of tyranny and oppression. In 1768, he joined his 
          father and fellow compatriots in rising against injustice and 
          fighting for Polish independence. As a commander in the 
          rebellion, the young Pole demonstrated a devotion to freedom 
          and great courage. When the rebellion was quelled, Pulaski was 
          exiled to France, where he continued to pursue freedom with 
          the same spirit and determination that he had shown in Poland.
          While in Paris, he met with the American envoy to France, 
          Benjamin Franklin, who discussed with him America's struggle 
          for independence. Pulaski then volunteered his services to 
          General George Washington. In his first letter to General 
          Washington after arriving in America in the summer of 1777, 
          General Pulaski pledged that he ``came here, where freedom is 
          being defended, to serve it, and to live and die for it.'' 
          Impressed with General Pulaski's abilities and battle 
          experience, General Washington commissioned him as a Brigadier 
          General of the American cavalry. In May 1779, General 
          Pulaski's new cavalry division successfully defended the city 
          of Charleston, South Carolina. Several months later, in the 
          siege of Savannah, General Pulaski was mortally wounded while 
          trying to raise morale and rally his troops who were under 
          heavy enemy fire.
          General Pulaski's bravery and sacrifice helped lead America to 
          victory, and today, the Polish motto_``for your freedom and 
          ours''_echoes the great spirit of this Polish and American 
          hero. This day, we commemorate General Pulaski's service to 
          our Nation and draw strength from his example. We also honor 
          the sacrifices of the many men and women of Poland and other 
          allied nations who persevere with us in the fight for freedom.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim October 11, 2003, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I 
          encourage all Americans to commemorate this occasion with 
          appropriate programs and activities paying tribute to Casimir 
          Pulaski and honoring all those who defend the freedom of our 
          Nation.

Proclamation 7722 of October 15, 2003

White Cane Safety Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Every day, millions of Americans who are blind or visually 
          impaired use the white cane as they travel, attend school, or 
          work. The white cane remains one of the most important and 
          reliable tools for people who are blind or visually impaired. 
          It increases the mobility of these citizens, facilitating 
          their inclusion in all aspects of American life. Since 1964 on 
          White Cane Safety Day, America has reaffirmed our commitment 
          to achieving equal opportunity and full independence for those 
          who are blind or visually impaired.
          Today, more people with disabilities are attending school and 
          working than ever before. However, much work remains to fully 
          open the doors of opportunity for citizens who are blind or 
          visually impaired. To meet these challenges, I have created 
          the New Freedom Initiative, a comprehensive plan to assist 
          Americans with disabilities by increasing access to 
          educational and employment opportunities. This initiative is 
          lowering barriers more so that Americans can participate fully 
          in their communities, and live and work in dignity and 
          freedom.
          My Administration also continues to promote implementation of 
          section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This important 
          statute requires the Federal Government to make more of its 
          electronic and information technology resources, including 
          Government websites, accessible to people with disabilities.
          As we recognize the contributions of people who are blind or 
          visually impaired, we resolve to continue building a better 
          America where all individuals are celebrated for their 
          abilities and encouraged to achieve their dreams.
          The Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88	628) approved 
          on October 6, 1964, as amended, has designated October 15 of 
          each year as ``White Cane Safety Day.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2003, as 
          White Cane Safety Day. I call upon public officials, 
          educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States 
          to join with me in ensuring that all the benefits and 
          privileges of life in our great Nation are available to blind 
          and visually impaired individuals, and to observe this day 
          with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation 7723 of October 17, 2003

National Forest Products Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Our forests are a source of pride for our Nation. They benefit 
          many Americans who depend on healthy forests for their 
          livelihoods and quality of life. As we celebrate National 
          Forest Products Week, we recognize the importance of our 
          forest resources. We remain committed to sound, commonsense, 
          forest management.
          Beyond their scenic beauty, our forests are vital to our 
          economy and our way of life. Numerous jobs in the 
          manufacturing and construction industries, as well as in the 
          forest products industries, rely on the health and 
          sustainability of our forests. Forests provide lumber for 
          building our homes, they provide paper for publishing our 
          books and newspapers, and forests are the source of many other 
          wood and paper products that Americans use every day.
          We have a responsibility to maintain the health and 
          productivity of our forests. In the past, forests have been 
          spoiled by overgrowth, decimated by insects and disease, and 
          devastated by wildfires. My Administration's Healthy Forests 
          Initiative will help prevent this kind of destruction. Aided 
          by this Initiative, we treated nearly 2.6 million acres of 
          forests during the last fiscal year to reduce dangerous 
          overgrowth and restore forest health. This is more than double 
          the number of acres that were treated 3 years ago. My 
          Administration is also committed to fulfilling the promise of 
          the 1994 Northwest Forest Plan to protect our most sensitive 
          forest areas, while supporting a viable forest products 
          industry and jobs in rural America. By encouraging active 
          forest management and sustainable timber harvesting, we 
          strengthen our economy and ensure the lasting beauty of our 
          woodlands.
          Recognizing the importance of our forests in ensuring the 
          long-term welfare of our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 
          86	753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week 
          beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as 
          ``National Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and 
          requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance 
          of this week.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim October 19 through 
          October 25, 2003, as National Forest Products Week. I call 
          upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate 
          ceremonies and activities.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          seventeenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two

          of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7724 of October 18, 2003

National Character Counts Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Many of our society's most cherished values, such as equal 
          treatment for fellow citizens and respect for the law, depend 
          in practice on individual character. During National Character 
          Counts Week, we recognize the importance that good character 
          has played in our history, celebrate the great character 
          exhibited by our citizens, and reaffirm our commitment to 
          promoting the values that will ensure a better future for all.
          Throughout history, we see numerous examples of character in 
          action. Great social reformers like Harriet Tubman, Frederick 
          Douglass, and Susan B. Anthony demonstrated courage and 
          resolve when they stood firm in the face of injustice and 
          acted to right societal wrongs. Similarly, leaders like 
          Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt, were able to guide our 
          Nation through critical periods because of their strong 
          personal convictions and sense of moral clarity. Today, these 
          and other heroes of history inspire us to pursue virtue and 
          character in our own lives.
          Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we have 
          seen the great character of our Nation in the hearts and souls 
          of our citizens and soldiers, and in countless acts of 
          kindness, generosity, and sacrifice. To sustain this spirit 
          and continue to improve our society, we must promote a culture 
          of service, citizenship, and responsibility in our Nation. 
          Through the USA Freedom Corps, my Administration is offering 
          opportunities for citizens to give back to their communities, 
          helping millions of Americans meet vital needs as active and 
          engaged citizens in our democratic society.
          The development of character and citizenship has always been a 
          primary goal of America's schools. Today, it is more important 
          than ever that we educate our young people to be 
          knowledgeable, compassionate, and involved citizens of a free 
          society. Since 2002, 47 State education agencies and local 
          school districts have received grants to implement character 
          education programs. These grants help schools work with 
          students, parents, and community organizations to effectively 
          teach universal values such as respect, honesty, and 
          tolerance.
          This week, I urge all Americans to join me in promoting good 
          character in America. By teaching these values to our children 
          and living by these values in our own lives, we can build a 
          future of hope, compassion, and opportunity for all.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and

[[Page 129]]

          laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 19 
          through October 25, 2003, as National Character Counts Week. I 
          call upon public officials, educators, librarians, parents, 
          students, and all the people of the United States to observe 
          this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
          programs.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          eighteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States 
          of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Protection From Pornography Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Pornography can have debilitating effects on communities, 
          marriages, families, and children. During Protection From 
          Pornography Week, we commit to take steps to confront the 
          dangers of pornography.
          The effects of pornography are particularly pernicious with 
          respect to children. The recent enactment of the PROTECT Act 
          of 2003 strengthens child pornography laws, establishes the 
          Federal Government's role in the AMBER Alert System, increases 
          punishment for Federal crimes against children, and authorizes 
          judges to require extended supervision of sex offenders who 
          are released from prison.
          We have committed significant resources to the Department of 
          Justice to intensify investigative and prosecutorial efforts 
          to combat obscenity, child pornography, and child sexual 
          exploitation on the Internet. We are vigorously prosecuting 
          and severely punishing those who would harm our children. Last 
          July, the Department of Homeland Security launched Operation 
          Predator, an initiative to help identify child predators, 
          rescue children depicted in child pornography, and prosecute 
          those responsible for making and distributing child 
          pornography.
          Last year, I signed legislation creating the Dot Kids domain, 
          a child-friendly zone on the Internet. The sites on this 
          domain are monitored for content and safety, offering parents 
          assurances that their children are learning in a healthy 
          environment. Working together with law enforcement officials, 
          parents, and other caregivers, we are making progress in 
          protecting our children from pornography.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim October 26 through November 1, 2003, as Protection 
          From Pornography Week. I call upon public officials, law 
          enforcement officers, parents, and all the people of the 
          United States to observe this week with appropriate programs 
          and activities.

United Nations Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          The United Nations is a vital international arena for 
          countries to cooperate in pursuit of political, economic, and 
          social freedoms. Founded by 51 Member countries after World 
          War II, the organization has grown through the years to 
          include 191 Member States. On United Nations Day, we celebrate 
          the organization's founding principles of freedom, democracy, 
          and human rights, and we recognize the contributions of the 
          United Nations to improving lives around the world.
          As an original signatory of the United Nations Charter, the 
          United States continues to advance the United Nations' 
          founding principles. We are working with the United Nations to 
          reduce conflicts around the world, fight terrorism, abolish 
          trafficking in persons, and support those in need, including 
          the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as they continue to build 
          free and stable countries. As we commemorate the 58th 
          anniversary of the United Nations, we honor the victims of the 
          recent bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad 
          who worked to advance peace and freedom.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim October 24, 2003, as United Nations Day. I urge the 
          Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth 
          of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the 
          flag of the United States to honor the observance of United 
          Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          fourth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand

National Hospice Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Hospice care plays an important role in American medicine by 
          easing a patient's suffering while reaffirming individual 
          dignity in a familiar, comfortable environment. Across our 
          Nation, hospice care providers are assisting in hospitals, 
          nursing homes, and private residences, offering physical, 
          emotional, and spiritual support to patients who often have a 
          short life expectancy.
          Hospice teams consist of physicians, nurses, social workers, 
          counselors, and volunteers who are experts in end-of-life 
          issues. They offer pain management, therapy, nutrition, and 
          other supportive care in the home or other comfortable 
          surroundings, making it easier for patients, family members, 
          and friends to spend time together in their loved one's final 
          days. Hospice experts also offer grief counseling to friends 
          and family members after their loss.
          Every stage of human life deserves to be treated with respect 
          and care. I commend all those who work and volunteer as 
          hospice care providers. Their contributions make our Nation a 
          better place.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 2003 as National Hospice Month. I encourage 
          Americans to increase their awareness of hospice service and 
          to observe this month with appropriate activities and 
          programs.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth

Proclamation 7728 of October 31, 2003

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Recent studies estimate that 4.5 million Americans are 
          affected by Alzheimer's disease, and that more than 13 million 
          will be affected by the middle of this century. As we seek to 
          increase our understanding of the causes, symptoms, and 
          effects of this disease, we recognize the victims and the 
          family members, caregivers, and healthcare professionals who 
          care for those afflicted with it.
          Researchers have not yet discovered the cause of Alzheimer's 
          disease, but its effects are well documented. Alzheimer's 
          disrupts the processes that

[[Page 132]]

          keep nerve cells in the brain healthy, resulting in a decline 
          in cognitive abilities. Those affected by Alzheimer's disease 
          grow increasingly dependent on others.
          Alzheimer's disease has no known cure or certain treatment, 
          but research will continue to lead us to breakthroughs that 
          will help control the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease or 
          eventually cure or even reverse its effects. We are supporting 
          Alzheimer's research and helping those afflicted with the 
          disease get care. Through the National Institute on Aging 
          (NIA), we are funding Alzheimer's Disease Centers across the 
          country that care for patients, improve diagnostic techniques, 
          and participate in long-term research. The NIA also operates 
          the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, which 
          provides vital information to people with Alzheimer's disease 
          and their caregivers. In addition, scientists at the National 
          Institutes of Health and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
          are conducting clinical trials of drugs and enhancing overall 
          care.
          During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we 
          especially thank all who care for those affected by this 
          tragic disease. By caring for patients and continuing vital 
          research, we strive to improve the quality of life for today's 
          victims and enhance the health of future generations.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 2003 as National Alzheimer's Disease 
          Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States 
          to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
          activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-
          first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand

          Almost 17 million Americans have diabetes, a disease that 
          prevents the body from using its own insulin to break down 
          sugars. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United 
          States. During National Diabetes Month, we recognize 
          advancements in preventing, treating, and detecting this 
          disease, and we renew our commitment to helping Americans with 
          diabetes live longer, healthier lives.
          Diabetes can lead to severe complications, including heart 
          disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity 
          amputations. Up to 1 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, 
          an autoimmune disorder that destroys insulin-producing cells 
          in the pancreas, while an estimated 16 million Americans have 
          type 2 diabetes, in which the body does not sufficiently 
          produce

[[Page 133]]

          or process enough insulin. Type 2 diabetes is often related to 
          obesity, and it is rising rapidly among men and women of all 
          ages. Type 2 diabetes is also on the rise among children, for 
          whom it was once extremely rare. Modest weight loss, increased 
          exercise, and a healthy diet can decrease the risk of type 2 
          diabetes and help manage its complications.
          Through the HealthierUS Initiative, my Administration is 
          helping Americans develop the healthier habits that can 
          improve their quality of life. And the Centers for Disease 
          Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health 
          are working together through the National Diabetes Education 
          Program to educate Americans at risk for diabetes and to 
          instruct those living with the disease about controlling blood 
          glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol. By raising awareness 
          in our communities and providing assistance to those battling 
          the disease, we are fighting diabetes.
          My Administration also has demonstrated a strong commitment to 
          medical research by completing a 5-year commitment to double 
          the NIH budget to more than $27 billion. During fiscal year 
          2003, the NIH invested an estimated $860.5 million into 
          diabetes research. We will continue to support NIH scientists 
          and others working to treat and cure this disease.
          During National Diabetes Month, we commend those advancing the 
          fight against diabetes as they bring hope and health to 
          millions of Americans.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 2003 as National Diabetes Month. I call upon 
          all Americans to increase their awareness of the risk factors 
          and symptoms related to diabetes and to observe this month 
          with appropriate programs and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-
          first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

National Family Caregivers Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Millions of Americans make extraordinary efforts every day to 
          care for loved ones who are elderly, chronically ill, or 
          disabled. These caregivers make many sacrifices to improve the 
          lives of their loved ones. Through their love, dedication, and 
          courage, these compassionate children, parents, spouses, 
          grandparents, and extended family members strengthen and 
          preserve the importance of family and reflect the true 
          character of our Nation.

[[Page 134]]

          My Administration is supporting family caregivers in their 
          efforts to provide comfort and support to their loved ones. 
          The National Family Caregiver Support Program, managed by the 
          Administration on Aging of the Department of Health and Human 
          Services, gives family caregivers counseling, information, 
          respite care, and supplemental services.
          As we mark National Family Caregivers Month, we express our 
          gratitude to family caregivers, and celebrate the great 
          blessings they bring to their families and to our Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 2003 as National Family Caregivers Month. I 
          encourage all Americans to honor and support family members, 
          friends, and neighbors who assume important caregiving 
          responsibilities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-
          first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

National Adoption Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Every year, tens of thousands of American families answer the 
          call to adopt a child. During National Adoption Month, we 
          recognize America's adoptive and foster families. We also 
          commit to helping all of our children, including those waiting 
          in foster care, find safe, permanent, and loving homes.
          On November 22, communities across the country will come 
          together to celebrate National Adoption Day by finalizing the 
          adoptions of over 3,000 children from foster care. On this day 
          and all this month, we honor families that have opened their 
          hearts and homes to a child.
          The number of children who are adopted has increased in recent 
          years. Still, thousands of children in our country_many with 
          special needs_continue to wait in foster care for an adoptive 
          family.
          We are taking important steps to make adoption more 
          commonplace and to protect the well-being of our children. We 
          have eased the financial burden of adoption by nearly doubling 
          the maximum adoption tax credit. We expanded the Promoting 
          Safe and Stable Families Program, which encourages adoption at 
          the local level and supports adoptive families with services 
          that ease a child's transition into a new family and help to 
          strengthen the family. The Department of Health and Human 
          Services provides incentives to States that increase the 
          number of children adopted from State-supervised foster care.

[[Page 135]]

          Last year, my Administration launched the first Federal 
          adoption website, www.AdoptUSKids.org, which features pictures 
          and profiles of children available for adoption. This site 
          helps loving families connect with waiting children across the 
          country. Already, more than 1,700 children featured on the 
          site have been placed with adoptive families. This progress is 
          testimony to the selfless spirit of American families.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 2003 as National Adoption Month. I call on 
          all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs 
          and activities to honor adoptive families and to participate 
          in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh 
          day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the

World Freedom Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Fourteen years ago, freedom-loving people tore down the Berlin 
          Wall and began to set a nation free from Communist oppression. 
          On World Freedom Day, the United States joins with other 
          countries in commemorating that historic day. The United 
          States is committed to liberty, freedom, and the universal 
          struggle for human rights. We strive to advance peace and 
          democracy and to safeguard these ideals around the world.
          After dividing families, friends, and communities for 28 
          years, the dismantling of the Berlin Wall reunited Germany and 
          helped spread freedom across Central and Eastern Europe. With 
          free elections and the spread of democratic values, these 
          countries won their liberty, and their people became free. 
          These democracies today contribute to a strong Europe, and the 
          United States values their friendship and their partnership.
          On World Freedom Day, Americans express gratitude for our 
          freedom and dedicate ourselves to upholding the ideals of 
          democracy. Today, we are working with other nations to bring 
          freedom to people around the world. American and coalition 
          forces are sacrificing to bring peace, security, and liberty 
          to Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. This is a mission for all 
          who believe in democracy, tolerance, and freedom.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 9, 2003, as World Freedom Day. I call upon 
          the people of the United States to observe this day with 
          appropriate ceremonies and activities and to affirm their 
          dedication to freedom and democracy for all.

Proclamation 7733 of November 10, 2003

Veterans Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          The willingness of America's veterans to sacrifice for our 
          country has earned them our lasting gratitude. On this, our 
          Nation's 50th annual Veterans Day observance, we celebrate and 
          honor the patriots who have fought to protect the democratic 
          ideals that are the foundation of our country.
          When the armistice ending World War I was signed on November 
          11, 1918, more than 4.7 million Americans put down their arms 
          and turned to the work of strengthening our Nation. The end of 
          that first global conflict was initially commemorated as 
          Armistice Day. In 1954, the Congress renamed the day as 
          Veterans Day to recognize all those who have served in our 
          Armed Forces.
          Throughout our history, loyal citizens from every corner of 
          America have willingly assumed the duty of military life. And 
          time after time, in conflicts across the globe, they have 
          proven that democracy is mightier than tyranny. From World War 
          I and World War II, to the conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and 
          the Persian Gulf, to the recent battles in the war on terror, 
          our military has built a great tradition of courageous and 
          faithful service. Our veterans have helped bring freedom to 
          countries around the world. Free nations and peoples liberated 
          by American troops are grateful for the long, distinguished 
          line of American veterans who have come to their aid.
          Today, our veterans inspire new generations of Americans as we 
          work to defeat terrorism and advance peace. In respect for and 
          recognition of the contributions our service men and women 
          have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
          the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 
          of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to 
          honor veterans.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2003, as 
          Veterans Day and urge all Americans to observe November 9 
          through November 15, 2003, as National Veterans Awareness 
          Week. I encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and 
          sacrifice of our veterans through appropriate ceremonies and 
          prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to 
          display the flag of the United States and to participate in 
          patriotic activities in their communities. I invite civic and 
          fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, 
          businesses, unions, and the media to support this national 
          observance with suitable commemorative expressions and 
          programs.

America Recycles Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          To preserve America's majestic beauty, we must conserve our 
          natural resources and practice responsible stewardship. On 
          America Recycles Day, we reaffirm our commitment to 
          conservation and recognize the increase in recycling in the 
          last two decades.
          Twenty-five years ago, only one community in the United States 
          had a curbside recycling program. Today, more than 9,000 
          communities have curbside collection, and many others provide 
          drop-off centers or cooperative collection facilities. 
          Businesses and communities are boosting recycling collection 
          efforts, and companies are using new technologies and methods 
          to manufacture products more efficiently. Manufacturers, 
          retailers, and governmental and non-governmental organizations 
          are engaging in voluntary product stewardship partnerships to 
          reduce waste. Industries are also discovering ways to reduce 
          waste and cost, cut pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, 
          and conserve energy and water.
          Many of the products used every day, including aluminum cans, 
          appliances, office paper, cardboard boxes, furniture, and 
          clothing contain recycled materials. We also recycle motor 
          oil, tires, plastic, glass, batteries, and building materials, 
          and we are developing new ways to recycle electronic products_
          the fastest growing portion of America's municipal waste.
          On America Recycles Day, I encourage individuals, businesses, 
          communities, tribes, and government to continue to work 
          together as good stewards of America's resources. By using our 
          resources wisely, we help build a stronger economy and a 
          healthier future.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 15, 2003, as America Recycles Day. I call 
          upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
          appropriate programs and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          fourteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States

National American Indian Heritage Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          During National American Indian Heritage Month, we honor the 
          accomplishments and culture of American Indians and Alaska 
          Natives and recognize their contributions to our country. To 
          help educate Americans and illustrate the important role of 
          these native people to our Nation, the new National Museum of 
          the American Indian will open next year.
          American Indians and Alaska Natives have a long tradition of 
          serving with pride and accomplishment in the United States 
          Armed Forces. Today, their patriotism is reflected in the more 
          than 13,000 American Indians and Alaska Natives serving on 
          active duty and the more than 6,400 reservists. In Iraq, 
          Specialist Lori Piestewa of the Army's 507th Maintenance 
          Company and a member of the Hopi tribe, was the first American 
          servicewoman killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and the only 
          known American Indian woman killed in action in any conflict. 
          Her bravery, service, and sacrifice are an inspiration to our 
          men and women in uniform and to all Americans.
          To ensure the future success of America's tribal communities, 
          my Administration is committed to improving education, 
          increasing employment and economic development, and ensuring 
          better access to health and human services for all American 
          Indians and Alaska natives. Government-wide, we proposed in 
          the 2004 Budget to spend over $11 billion on Native American 
          programs. The Department of Education's Office of Indian 
          Education is working to implement the No Child Left Behind Act 
          of 2001 within the Native American community. Indian tribes, 
          schools, and local education agencies that serve American 
          Indian and Native Alaska children will have access to nearly 
          $122 million in grants to improve education opportunities. In 
          addition, the Department of the Interior's 2004 program 
          includes over $49 million for America's tribal colleges and 
          universities. This investment will help American Indian 
          students reach their full potential and achieve their dreams. 
          We are also working to address the healthcare needs of 
          American Indians, particularly the rising incidence of 
          diabetes.
          The United States has a strong relationship with American 
          Indian tribes and Alaska Native entities. By continuing to 
          work on a government-to-government basis with these tribal 
          governments, we are fostering greater understanding and 
          promoting tribal self-determination and self-governance.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 2003 as National American Indian Heritage 
          Month. This month, I encourage citizens to learn more about 
          the rich heritage of American Indians and Alaska Natives and 
          the role they have played in building and sustaining our 
          Nation and to commemorate this month with appropriate programs 
          and activities.

Proclamation 7736 of November 14, 2003

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          From before the American Revolution, to the Civil War, to the 
          wars in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf, our National Guard and 
          Reserve have served our country with distinction. Today, our 
          National Guard and Reserve forces are active on every front in 
          the War on Terror. During National Employer Support of the 
          Guard and Reserve Week, we honor our courageous citizen-
          soldiers and their employers, whose continued support is vital 
          to the success of our Armed Forces and to the strength of our 
          country.
          America's Guard and Reserve personnel are training hard and 
          deploying frequently to meet new challenges worldwide. These 
          brave defenders have performed combat operations in Iraq and 
          Afghanistan. They have provided security at Guantanamo Bay. 
          They have prepared for homeland security missions. Our Nation 
          is blessed and grateful for the service of the brave men and 
          women of the National Guard and Reserve.
          By supporting our Guardsmen and Reservists, employers across 
          our Nation also are helping to advance freedom and democracy 
          around the world. At the same time, these employers benefit 
          from the experience and leadership skills these citizen-
          soldiers bring home. Employer support of our Guard and Reserve 
          in the United States and abroad helps ensure our troops are 
          mission-ready and is a source of pride and assurance for all 
          Americans. This country is grateful to employers and workers 
          for their support of Guard and Reserve members and their 
          families. Because military deployment often disrupts families 
          and businesses, my Administration is working to make 
          deployments more predictable. Together, our National Guard and 
          Reserve forces and their employers are united in purpose and 
          reflect the highest standards of professionalism and honor.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 16 through November 22, 2003, as National 
          Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. I encourage 
          all Americans to join me in expressing our heartfelt thanks to 
          the members of our National Guard and Reserve and their 
          civilian employers for their extraordinary sacrifices on 
          behalf of our Nation. I also call on State and local 
          officials, private organizations, businesses, and all military 
          commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies 
          and activities.

Proclamation 7737 of November 19, 2003

National Farm-City Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          During National Farm-City Week, Americans honor the hard work 
          of the men and women who earn a living from the land, and we 
          recognize the importance of their partnerships with urban 
          communities.
          Our farmers and ranchers face many challenges, including 
          weather, crop disease, and uncertain pricing. Yet with hard 
          work and a love of the land, they have helped America build 
          the most productive agricultural economy in the world. This 
          industry generates 16 percent of America's Gross Domestic 
          Product and employs 17 percent of our workforce.
          Our farmers and ranchers build and sustain this industry with 
          the help of others. While farmers and ranchers manage almost 
          half of our Nation's land, they need processors, shippers, 
          retailers, food service providers, and many others to move 
          their products from the farm to the homes of Americans and 
          people around the world. As these cooperative networks provide 
          us with food, clothing, and energy, they help to create a 
          prosperous future for America and the world.
          As we celebrate National Farm-City Week, I urge citizens to 
          learn more about the American farm-city partnership and how it 
          strengthens our country.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 21 through November 27, 2003, as National 
          Farm-City Week. I encourage all Americans to join in 
          recognizing the hard work, entrepreneurship, and ingenuity of 
          those who produce and promote America's agricultural goods.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          nineteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States 
          of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7738 of November 21, 2003

Thanksgiving Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Each year on Thanksgiving, we gather with family and friends 
          to thank God for the many blessings He has given us, and we 
          ask God to continue to guide and watch over our country.
          Almost 400 years ago, after surviving their first winter at 
          Plymouth, the Pilgrims celebrated a harvest feast to give 
          thanks. George Washington proclaimed the first National Day of 
          Thanksgiving in 1789, and Abraham Lincoln revived the 
          tradition during the Civil War. Since that time, our citizens 
          have paused to express thanks for the bounty of blessings we 
          enjoy and to spend time with family and friends. In want or in 
          plenty, in times of challenge or times of calm, we always have 
          reasons to be thankful.
          America is a land of abundance, prosperity, and hope. We must 
          never take for granted the things that make our country great: 
          a firm foundation of freedom, justice, and equality; a belief 
          in democracy and the rule of law; and our fundamental rights 
          to gather, speak, and worship freely.
          These liberties do not come without cost. Throughout history, 
          many have sacrificed to preserve our freedoms and to defend 
          peace around the world. Today, the brave men and women of our 
          military continue this noble tradition. These heroes and their 
          loved ones have the gratitude of our Nation.
          On this day, we also remember those less fortunate among us. 
          They are our neighbors and our fellow citizens, and we are 
          committed to reaching out to them and to all of those in need 
          in our communities.
          This Thanksgiving, we again give thanks for all of our 
          blessings and for the freedoms we enjoy every day. Our 
          Founders thanked the Almighty and humbly sought His wisdom and 
          blessing. May we always live by that same trust, and may God 
          continue to watch over and bless the United States of America.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim Thursday, November 27, 2003, as a National Day of 
          Thanksgiving. I encourage Americans to gather in their homes, 
          places of worship, and community centers to share the spirit 
          of understanding and prayer and to reinforce ties of family 
          and community.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          first day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7739 of November 21, 2003

National Family Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          As Americans gather during Thanksgiving week, we honor our 
          families, and we recognize the family as a source of help, 
          hope, and stability for our citizens and for our country.
          Strong families make our Nation better. They teach our 
          children values and help them become responsible citizens. We 
          must encourage families to be loving and compassionate, 
          generous and supportive, and to serve and help others.
          On this Thanksgiving week, we also pay respect to our brave 
          military families whose loved ones are on active duty, many on 
          the front lines of freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. These 
          families provide a bond of love and encouragement to our men 
          and women in uniform as they defend liberty and protect our 
          Nation.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim November 23 through November 29, 2003, as National 
          Family Week. I invite the States, communities, and all the 
          people of the United States to join together in observing this 
          week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our 
          Nation's families.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-
          first day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand 
          three, and of the Independence of the United States of America 
          the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7740 of December 1, 2003

World AIDS Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          The HIV/AIDS pandemic presents one of the greatest medical and 
          social challenges of our time. On World AIDS Day, members of 
          the global community come together to demonstrate our shared 
          commitment to turning the tide against the spread of HIV/AIDS, 
          bringing hope and healing to those who are suffering, and 
          finding a cure.
          Over the last two decades, AIDS has claimed the lives of more 
          than 20 million people. Three million have died in the last 
          year alone. Today, more than 40 million people are living with 
          HIV, including nearly 30 million in

[[Page 143]]

          Africa. Behind these staggering numbers are the names and 
          faces of orphaned and suffering children, devastated 
          communities, and a continent in crisis.
          In my State of the Union Message to the Congress in January of 
          this year, I announced an ``Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief,'' 
          with a goal of helping millions around the world affected by 
          HIV/AIDS, particularly those in the most afflicted nations in 
          Africa and the Caribbean. In May, the Congress responded by 
          passing the ``United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, 
          Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003,'' which I signed into 
          law. A life-saving initiative, the Act commits $15 billion 
          over the next 5 years to prevent 7 million new HIV infections, 
          treat at least 2 million people with life-extending drugs, 
          provide care for at least 10 million people affected by AIDS, 
          continue bilateral programs in over 75 countries, and increase 
          support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and 
          Malaria. This work of mercy will help overcome fear, stigma, 
          and discrimination and create a cycle of hope and promise that 
          will benefit millions.
          Here at home, we will spend more than $15 billion this year to 
          combat AIDS in America. This money will support research 
          activities, care and treatment services, and prevention 
          programs, including the wide availability of rapid HIV 
          testing.
          Fighting HIV/AIDS is not only a great challenge but also a 
          moral imperative for those who believe in the value and 
          dignity of every human life. This World AIDS Day, the United 
          States remains committed to taking action, showing compassion, 
          and bringing hope to those affected by HIV/AIDS around the 
          world.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim December 1, 2003, as World AIDS Day. I urge the 
          Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
          officials of the other territories subject to the jurisdiction 
          of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
          reaffirming our commitment to combating HIV/AIDS. I encourage 
          all Americans to participate in appropriate commemorative 
          programs and ceremonies in houses of worship, workplaces, and 
          other community centers to remember those who have lost their 
          lives to this deadly disease and to comfort and support those 
          living with and affected by HIV/AIDS.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day 
          of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7741 of December 4, 2003

To Provide for the Termination of Action Taken With Regard to Imports of 
Certain Steel Products

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          1. Proclamation 7529 of March 5, 2002, implemented actions 
          (safeguard measures) of a type described in section 
          203(a)(3)(A) and (B) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 
          U.S.C. 2253(a)(3)(A) and (B)) (the ``Trade Act''), with 
          respect to imports of certain flat steel (consisting of slabs, 
          plate, hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel, and coated steel), 
          hot-rolled bar, cold-finished bar, rebar, certain welded 
          tubular products, carbon and alloy fittings, stainless steel 
          bar, stainless steel rod, tin mill products, and stainless 
          steel wire, as defined in paragraph 7 of Proclamation 7529 
          (collectively, ``certain steel products'').
          2. In Proclamation 7529 and Proclamation 7576 of July 3, 2002, 
          I authorized the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to 
          further consider any request for exclusion of a particular 
          product and upon finding that a particular product should be 
          excluded, to modify the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff 
          Schedule of the United States (HTS) created by the Annex to 
          Proclamation 7529 to exclude such particular product from the 
          pertinent safeguard measure established in Proclamation 7529. 
          Pursuant to that authorization, the USTR published four 
          notices of exclusions of products from the safeguard measures 
          in the Federal Register at 67 Fed. Reg. 16484 (April 5, 2002), 
          67 Fed. Reg. 46221 (July 12, 2002), 67 Fed. Reg. 56182 (August 
          30, 2002), and 68 Fed. Reg. 15494 (March 31, 2003). The USTR 
          also published notice in the Federal Register of technical 
          corrections to that Annex.
          3. In a Memorandum of March 5, 2002 (67 Fed. Reg. 10593), 
          pursuant to section 203(a)(3)(I) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 
          2253(a)(3)(I)), I instructed the Secretary of the Treasury and 
          the Secretary of Commerce to establish a system of import 
          licensing to facilitate the monitoring of imports of certain 
          steel products. To provide for efficient and fair 
          administration of this action, pursuant to section 203(g) of 
          the Trade Act, I instructed the Secretary of Commerce to 
          publish regulations in the Federal Register establishing such 
          a system of import licensing (the ``Licensing System''). Those 
          regulations were published on December 31, 2002, at 67 Fed. 
          Reg. 79845.
          4. Section 204(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)) 
          requires the United States International Trade Commission 
          (ITC) to monitor developments with respect to the domestic 
          industry while action taken under section 203 remains in 
          effect. If the initial period of a safeguard action exceeds 3 
          years, then the ITC must submit to the President a report on 
          the results of such monitoring not later than the date that is 
          the mid-point of the initial period of the safeguard action. 
          The ITC report in Investigation Number TA	204	9 was submitted 
          on September 19, 2003.
          5. Section 204(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 
          2254(b)(1)(A)) authorizes the President to reduce, modify, or 
          terminate a safeguard action if, after taking into account any 
          report or advice submitted by the ITC and after seeking the 
          advice of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of 
          Labor,

[[Page 145]]

          he determines that changed circumstances warrant such 
          reduction, modification, or termination. The President's 
          determination may be made, inter alia, on the basis that the 
          effectiveness of the action taken under section 203 has been 
          impaired by changed economic circumstances.
          6. In view of the information provided in the ITC report, and 
          having sought advice from the Secretary of Commerce and the 
          Secretary of Labor, I determine that the effectiveness of the 
          actions taken under section 203(a)(3)(A) and (B) of the Trade 
          Act with respect to imports of certain steel products and the 
          exclusions from and technical corrections to the coverage of 
          Proclamation 7529 has been impaired by changed economic 
          circumstances. Accordingly, I have determined, pursuant to 
          section 204(b)(1)(A)(ii), that termination of the actions 
          taken under section 203(a)(3)(A) and (B) set forth in 
          Proclamation 7529 taken with respect to certain steel imports 
          is warranted. The action taken under section 203(a)(3)(I) set 
          forth in the Memorandum of March 5, 2002, requiring the 
          licensing and monitoring of imports of certain steel products 
          remains in effect and shall not terminate until the earlier of 
          March 21, 2005, or such time as the Secretary of Commerce 
          establishes a replacement program.
          7. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes 
          the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the 
          relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting 
          import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the 
          removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate 
          of duty or other import restriction.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, 
          including, but not limited to sections 204 and 604 of the 
          Trade Act and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do 
          proclaim that:
          (1) The HTS is modified as provided in the Annex to this 
          proclamation.
          (2) The United States Trade Representative is authorized, upon 
          his determination that the Secretary of Commerce has 
          established a replacement program pursuant to paragraph 6 of 
          this proclamation, to terminate the action under section 
          203(a)(3)(I) of the Trade Act set forth in the Memorandum of 
          March 5, 2002, and the Licensing System and to publish notice 
          of this determination and action in the Federal Register.
          (3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive 
          Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this 
          proclamation are superseded to the extent of such 
          inconsistency.
          (4) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation 
          shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn 
          from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m., 
          eastern standard time, December 5, 2003.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth 
          day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7742 of December 5, 2003

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          More than 60 years ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
          told Americans that December 7, 1941, was ``a date which will 
          live in infamy.'' On that morning, America was attacked 
          without warning and without provocation. More than 2,400 
          Americans died and 1,100 were wounded. Our country was changed 
          forever. Following that attack, our citizens responded with 
          the strength and resolve that characterizes America in times 
          of adversity, and that same spirit and courage carried us to 
          victory in World War II. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance 
          Day, we honor the lives lost in that attack and salute the 
          veterans of World War II. We also pay tribute to all those now 
          serving America to advance freedom around the world.
          The USS ARIZONA Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii, stands as a 
          monument to that ship's 1,177 crew members who died as a 
          result of the attack. Since the Memorial's dedication, more 
          than 40 million visitors have honored the heroism of these 
          brave sailors and marines. Laura and I had the opportunity to 
          visit the Memorial in October of this year. It is a fitting 
          tribute to the lives lost in defense of our freedom during the 
          greatest global conflict in history.
          America's liberty is sustained by the courage of the American 
          people. Every generation of Americans has answered the call to 
          protect the blessings of freedom and democracy. With the help 
          of our friends and allies, the brave men and women of our 
          Armed Forces are now engaged in a global war on terrorism. And 
          as in the aftermath of the terrible attack on Pearl Harbor, 
          our Nation will stay the course, and we will prevail.
          The Congress, by Public Law 103	308, as amended, has 
          designated December 7, 2003, as ``National Pearl Harbor 
          Remembrance Day.''
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2003, as 
          National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all 
          Americans to observe this solemn occasion with appropriate 
          ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies, 
          interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the 
          flag of the United States at half-staff this December 7 in 
          honor of those who died as a result of their service at Pearl 
          Harbor.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day 
          of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7743 of December 8, 2003

National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          Last year, more than 17,000 people were killed and 258,000 
          more were injured in alcohol-related crashes. Such accidents 
          cause unnecessary suffering, loss of life, and expense. During 
          National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, we 
          continue our efforts to stop impaired driving and improve the 
          safety of our roads during the holiday season and throughout 
          the year.
          We are enhancing both the education of our citizens about the 
          dangers of driving while under the influence and our methods 
          for keeping impaired drivers off the road. My Administration 
          is helping in this fight by supporting the enforcement of 
          traffic programs that teach Americans about the risks of 
          impaired driving. Earlier this year, my Administration 
          proposed to the Congress the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and 
          Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003 (SAFETEA), which 
          would elevate safe transportation to a national priority and 
          increase State resources for existing enforcement and 
          education efforts. While Federal help and funding are 
          important, State and local involvement is also critical. As 
          part of the Department of Transportation's National Highway 
          Traffic Safety Administration's ``You Drink & Drive. You 
          Lose.'' national campaign, from December 19, 2003, through 
          January 4, 2004, more than 10,000 law enforcement agencies 
          will join forces with community, health, government, and 
          business organizations to demonstrate that impaired driving is 
          unacceptable and unlawful.
           NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim December 2003 as National Drunk and Drugged Driving 
          Prevention Month. I encourage all Americans to join the ``You 
          Drink & Drive. You Lose.'' national campaign to protect our 
          citizens from impaired drivers.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth 
          day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7744 of December 10, 2003

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          America's founders dedicated this country to life, liberty, 
          and the pursuit of happiness. During Human Rights Day, Bill of 
          Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we recognize the advances 
          we have made expanding freedom, democracy, and individual 
          rights in this country and around the world.
          America has helped bring liberty to Afghanistan and Iraq. In 
          countries like Belarus, Cuba, and Zimbabwe, we continue to 
          stand with those who struggle for democracy. We will continue 
          to call on Burma's ruling junta to release political prisoners 
          and engage in an inclusive dialogue with the democratic 
          opposition to bring democracy to Burma. We also look forward 
          to the day when the men and women of North Korea can live in a 
          free society.
          Freedom is the right of mankind and the future of every 
          nation. It is not America's gift to the world; it is God's 
          gift to every man and woman who lives in this world.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
          proclaim December 10, 2003, as Human Rights Day; December 15, 
          2003, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week beginning December 
          10, 2003, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the people of the 
          United States to mark these observances with appropriate 
          ceremonies and activities.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day 
          of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, and 
          of the Independence of the United States of America the two 
          hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7745 of December 17, 2003

Wright Brothers Day, 2003

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          A spirit of exploration and discovery has been a part of the 
          American character since our founding days. Orville and Wilbur 
          Wright exemplified this spirit when they made the dream of 
          human flight a reality on December 17, 1903. On Wright 
          Brothers Day, we honor the vision of these bicycle mechanics 
          from Dayton, Ohio, and celebrate the centennial of manned, 
          powered flight.

[[Page 150]]

          One hundred years ago, the Wright brothers changed our world 
          with their 12-second, 120-foot flight in North Carolina. Their 
          achievement inspired other aviation pioneers and marked the 
          beginning of a new era of freedom. Since that first flight, 
          aviation and aerospace technology has advanced at a remarkable 
          pace, allowing us to fly across oceans, break the sound 
          barrier, orbit the Earth, land on the moon, and study our 
          universe in a way our ancestors could not have imagined. Each 
          new generation of engineers and other inventors, following in 
          the Wright Brothers' footsteps, continues to move the 
          technology of flight further.
          Today, air transportation touches the lives of people 
          throughout the United States, and helps unite the American 
          people. Air transportation brings families and friends 
          together, delivers aid to those in need, and facilitates 
          industry and commerce.
          As we look to the future, we remember the extraordinary 
          accomplishments of the Wright Brothers. Their determination 
          and innovation continue to inspire us as we embark on the 
          second century of flight.
          The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963 
          (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143) as amended, has designated 
          December 17 of each year as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has 
          authorized and requested the President to issue annually a 
          proclamation inviting the people of the United States to 
          observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2003, as 
          Wright Brothers Day.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 
          seventeenth day of December, in the year of our Lord two 
          thousand three, and of the Independence of the United States 
          of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003

To Implement the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          1. On June 6, 2003, the United States entered into the United 
          States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA). The Congress 
          approved the USCFTA in section 101(a) of the United States-
          Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USCFTA 
          Act'') (Public Law 108	77, 117 Stat. 909) (19 U.S.C. 3805 
          note).
          2. Section 105 of the USCFTA Act authorizes the President to 
          establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an 
          office that shall be responsible for providing administrative 
          assistance to panels established under Chapter 22 of the 
          USCFTA.
          3. Section 201 of the USCFTA authorizes the President to 
          proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such 
          continuation of duty-free

[[Page 151]]

          or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the 
          President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry 
          out or apply articles 3.3 (including the schedule of United 
          States duty reductions with respect to originating goods set 
          forth in Annex 3.3 to the USCFTA), 3.7, 3.9, and 3.20(8), (9), 
          (10), and (11) of the USCFTA.
          4. Section 202 of the USCFTA Act provides certain rules for 
          determining whether a good is an originating good for the 
          purpose of implementing tariff treatment under the USCFTA. I 
          have decided that it is necessary to include these rules of 
          origin, together with particular rules applicable to certain 
          other goods, in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
          States (HTS).
          5. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the USCFTA Act, Chile 
          is to be removed from the enumeration of designated 
          beneficiary developing countries eligible for the benefits of 
          the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Further, 
          consistent with section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the 
          ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, I have determined 
          that other technical and conforming changes to the HTS are 
          necessary to reflect that Chile is no longer eligible to 
          receive benefits of the GSP.
          6. Section 208 of the USCFTA Act authorizes the President to 
          direct the Secretary of the Treasury to take certain actions 
          related to verifications conducted consistent with Article 
          3.21 of the USCFTA.
          7. Subtitle B of title III of the USCFTA Act authorizes the 
          President to take certain actions in response to a request by 
          an interested party for relief from imports that are a cause 
          of serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic 
          industry producing certain textile or apparel articles.
          8. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, 
          establishes the Committee for the Implementation of Textile 
          Agreements (CITA) to supervise the implementation of textile 
          trade agreements.
          9. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended, authorizes the 
          President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant 
          provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import 
          treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, including the 
          removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate 
          of duty or other import restriction.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, 
          including but not limited to sections 105, 201, 202, and 208 
          of the USCFTA Act, section 604 of the 1974 Act, and section 
          301 of title 3, United States Code, do proclaim that:
          (1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff 
          treatment being accorded under the USCFTA, to set forth rules 
          for determining whether goods imported into the customs 
          territory of the United States are eligible for preferential 
          tariff treatment under the USCFTA, to provide certain other 
          treatment to originating goods for the purposes of the USCFTA, 
          to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain 
          originating goods, to reflect Chile's removal from the 
          enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries for 
          purposes of the GSP, and to make technical and conforming 
          changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified 
          as set forth in Annex I of Publication 3652 of the United 
          States International Trade Commission, entitled Modifications 
          of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of

[[Page 152]]

          the United States Implementing the United States-Chile Free 
          Trade Agreement (Publication 3652), which is incorporated by 
          reference into this proclamation.
          (2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty 
          elimination provided for in the USCFTA, and to provide for 
          future staged reductions in duties for products of Chile for 
          purposes of the USCFTA, the HTS is modified as provided in 
          Annex II of Publication 3652, effective on the dates specified 
          in the relevant sections of such publication and on any 
          subsequent dates set forth for such duty reductions in that 
          publication.
          (3) The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to exercise the 
          authority of the President under section 105(a) of the USCFTA 
          Act to establish or designate an office within the Department 
          of Commerce to carry out the functions set forth in that 
          section.
          (4) The CITA is authorized to exercise the authority of the 
          President under section 208 of the USCFTA Act with respect to 
          verifications conducted in a manner consistent with article 
          3.21 of the USCFTA.
          (5) The CITA is authorized to exercise the authority of the 
          President under subtitle B of title III of the USCFTA Act to 
          review requests and to determine whether to commence 
          consideration of such requests; to cause to be published in 
          the Federal Register a notice of commencement of consideration 
          of a request and notice seeking public comment; to determine 
          whether a Chilean textile or apparel article is being imported 
          into the United States in such increased quantities and under 
          such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat 
          thereof, to a domestic industry producing an article that is 
          like, or directly competitive with, the imported article; and 
          to provide relief from imports of an article that is the 
          subject of such a determination.
          (6)(a) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraph (2) of this 
          proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, 
          or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the 
          relevant dates indicated in Annex II to Publication 3652.
          (b) Except as provided in paragraph (6)(a) of this 
          proclamation, this proclamation shall be effective with 
          respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
          consumption, on or after January 1, 2004.
          (7) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive 
          Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this 
          proclamation are superseded to the extent of such 
          inconsistency.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth 
          day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-eighth.

Proc. 7748

Proclamation 7748 of December 30, 2003

To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and

Opportunity Act, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

          1. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
          (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by 
          section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
          (title I of Public Law 106	200) (AGOA), authorizes the 
          President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the 
          AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          country'' if the President determines that the country meets 
          the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the 
          AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set 
          forth in section 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
          2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to 
          designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an 
          ``eligible sub-Saharan African country'' if the President 
          determines that the country meets certain eligibility 
          requirements.
          3. Section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(B)) 
          provides special rules for certain apparel articles imported 
          from ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          countries.''
          4. In Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, President Clinton 
          designated the State of Eritrea (Eritrea) and the Central 
          African Republic as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries 
          pursuant to section 506A(a) of the 1974 Act and provided that 
          they would be considered lesser developed beneficiary sub-
          Saharan African countries for purposes of section 112(b)(3)(B) 
          of the AGOA.
          5. Section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) 
          authorizes the President to terminate the designation of a 
          country as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for 
          purposes of section 506A if he determines that the country is 
          not making continual progress in meeting the requirements 
          described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, effective on 
          January 1 of the year following the year in which such 
          determination is made.
          6. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) 
          of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the Republic of Angola 
          (Angola) meets the eligibility requirements set forth or 
          referenced therein, and I have decided to designate Angola as 
          an eligible sub-Saharan African country and as a beneficiary 
          sub-Saharan African country.

[[Page 156]]

          7. Angola satisfies the criterion for treatment as a ``lesser 
          developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country'' under 
          section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA.
          8. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act, I have 
          determined that Eritrea and the Central African Republic are 
          not making continual progress in meeting the requirements 
          described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act. Accordingly, 
          I have decided to terminate the designation of Eritrea and the 
          Central African Republic as beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          countries for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act, 
          effective on January 1, 2004.
          9. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
          President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
          United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions 
          of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and 
          actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
          continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
          restriction.
          10. Section 203(e)(2)(A) of the Andean Trade Preference Act, 
          as amended (ATPA) (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(2)(A)), requires the 
          President to publish in the Federal Register notice of any 
          action he proposes to take under section 203(e)(1) of the ATPA 
          (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(1)) at least 30 days before taking the 
          action. Section 212(e)(2)(A) of the Caribbean Basin Economic 
          Recovery Act, as amended (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2702(e)(2)(A)), 
          requires the President to publish in the Federal Register 
          notice of any action he proposes to take under section 
          212(e)(1) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2702(e)(1)) at least 30 days 
          before taking the action. Proclamation 7616 of October 31, 
          2002, provided for the assignment of a publication function 
          under these sections to the United States Trade Representative 
          (USTR), but did not precisely specify the function assigned.
          NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United 
          States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, 
          including sections 506A and 604 of the 1974 Act, section 104 
          of the AGOA, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, 
          do proclaim that:
          (1) Angola is designated as an eligible sub-Saharan African 
          country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
          (2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general 
          note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical 
          sequence in the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
          countries ``Republic of Angola.''
          (3) For purposes of section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA, Angola 
          is a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
          (4) The designation of Eritrea and the Central African 
          Republic as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for 
          purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act is terminated, 
          effective on January 1, 2004.
          (5) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning January 1, 
          2004, Eritrea and the Central African Republic shall no longer 
          be designated as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, 
          general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by deleting ``State 
          of Eritrea'' and ``Central African Republic'' from the list of 
          beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. Further, note 2(d) 
          to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS is modified by 
          deleting ``State of

[[Page 157]]

          Eritrea'' and ``Central African Republic'' from the list of 
          lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.
          (6) The modification to the HTS made by this proclamation 
          shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or 
          withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 
          1, 2004.
          (7) In order to assign to the USTR the publication function 
          set forth in section 203(e)(2)(A) of the ATPA and section 
          212(e)(2)(A) of the CBERA, paragraph (3) of Proclamation 7616 
          of October 31, 2002, is revised by deleting the phrase ``of 
          this proclamation'' and inserting in lieu thereof the phrase 
          ``of an action he proposes to take.''
          (8) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive 
          Orders that are inconsistent with this proclamation are 
          superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth 
          day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand three, 
          and of the Independence of the United States of America the 
          two hundred and twenty-eighth.

          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution

          Section 1. Establishment of the Office of Global 
          Communications. There is hereby established within the White 
          House Office an Office of Global Communications (the 
          ``Office'') to be headed by a Deputy Assistant to the 
          President for Global Communications.
          Sec. 2. Mission. The mission of the Office shall be to advise 
          the President, the heads of appropriate offices within the 
          Executive Office of the President, and the heads of executive 
          departments and agencies (agencies) on utilization of the most 
          effective means for the United States Government to ensure 
          consistency in messages that will promote the interests of the 
          United States abroad, prevent misunderstanding, build support 
          for and among coalition partners of the United States, and 
          inform international audiences. The Office shall provide such 
          advice on activities in which the role of the United States 
          Government is apparent or publicly acknowledged.
          Sec. 3. Functions. In carrying out its mission:
          (a) The Office shall assess the methods and strategies used by 
          the United States Government (other than special activities as 
          defined in Executive Order 12333 of December 4, 1981) to 
          deliver information to audiences abroad. The Office shall 
          coordinate the formulation among appropriate agencies of 
          messages that reflect the strategic communications framework 
          and priorities of the United States, and shall facilitate the 
          development of a strategy among the appropriate agencies to 
          effectively communicate such messages.
          (b) The Office shall work with the policy and communications 
          offices of agencies in developing a strategy for disseminating 
          truthful, accurate, and effective messages about the United 
          States, its Government and policies, and the American people 
          and culture. The Office may, after consulting with the 
          Department of State and obtaining the approval of the 
          Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs on 
          the President's behalf,

          work with cooperating foreign governments in the development 
          of the strategy. In performing its work, the Office shall 
          coordinate closely and regularly with the Assistant to the 
          President for National Security Affairs, or the Assistant's 
          designee.
          (c) The Office shall work with appropriate agencies to 
          coordinate the creation of temporary teams of communicators

          media attention as determined by the Office. Team members 
          shall include personnel from agencies to the extent permitted 
          by law and subject to the availability of personnel. In 
          performing its functions, each information team shall work to 
          disseminate accurate and timely information about topics of 
          interest to the on-site news media, and assist media personnel 
          in obtaining access to information, individuals, and events 
          that reinforce the strategic communications objectives of the 
          United States and its allies. The Office shall coordinate when 
          and where information teams should be deployed; provided, 
          however, no information team shall be deployed abroad without 
          prior consultation with the Department of State and the 
          Department of Defense, and prior notification to the Office of 
          the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.
          (d) The Office shall encourage the use of state-of-the-art 
          media and technology and shall advise the United States 
          Government of events, technologies, and other communications 
          tools that may be available for use in conveying information.
          Sec. 4. Administration. The Office of Administration within 
          the Executive Office of the President shall provide the Office 
          with administrative and related support, to the extent 
          permitted by law and subject to the availability of 
          appropriations, as directed by the Chief of Staff to the 
          President to carry out the provisions of this order.
          Sec. 5. Relationship to Other Interagency Coordinating 
          Mechanisms. Presidential direction regarding National Security 
          Council-related mechanisms for coordination of national 
          security policy shall apply with respect to the Office in the 
          same manner as it applies with respect to other elements of 
          the White House Office. Nothing in this order shall be 
          construed to impair or otherwise affect any function assigned 
          by law or by the President to the National Security Council or 
          to the Assistant to the President for National Security 
          Affairs.
          Sec. 6. Continuing Authorities. This order does not alter the 
          existing authorities of any agency. Agencies shall assist the 
          Deputy Assistant to the President for Global Communications, 
          to the extent consistent with applicable law and direction of 
          the President, and to the extent such assistance is consistent 
          with national security objectives and with the mission of such 
          agencies, in carrying out the Office's mission.
          Sec. 7. General Provisions.
          (a) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any 
          right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at 
          law or equity by any party against the United States, its 
          agencies, instrumentalities or entities, its officers or 
          employees, or any other person.

[[Page 161]]

          (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to grant to the 
          Office any authority to issue direction to agencies, officers, 
          or employees.

participation.

          Sec. 3. Administration. (a) Each Federal agency, to the extent 
          permitted by law and subject to the availability of

          Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.) (Act), may 
          apply to the administration of any portion of this order, any 
          functions of the President under the Act, except that of

          follows:
          ``Critical Infrastructure Protection in the Information Age
          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
          and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to 
          ensure protection of information systems for critical 
          infrastructure, including emergency preparedness 
          communications and the physical assets that support such 
          systems, in the information age, it is hereby ordered as 
          follows:
          Section 1. Policy. The information technology revolution has 
          changed the way business is transacted, government operates, 
          and national defense is conducted. Those three functions now 
          depend on an interdependent network of critical information 
          infrastructures. It is the policy of the United States to 
          protect against disruption of the operation of information 
          systems for critical infrastructure and thereby help to 
          protect the people, economy, essential human and government 
          services, and national security of the United States, and to 
          ensure that any disruptions that occur are infrequent, of 
          minimal duration, and manageable, and cause the least damage 
          possible. The implementation of this policy shall include a 
          voluntary public-private partnership, involving corporate and 
          nongovernmental organizations.
          Sec. 2. Continuing Authorities. This order does not alter the 
          existing authorities or roles of United States Government 
          departments and agencies. Authorities set forth in 44 U.S.C. 
          chapter 35, and other applicable law, provide senior officials 
          with responsibility for the security of Federal Government 
          information systems.

[[Page 168]]

          (a) Executive Branch Information Systems Security. The 
          Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has the 
          responsibility to develop and oversee the implementation of 
          government-wide policies, principles, standards, and 
          guidelines for the security of information systems that 
          support the executive branch departments and agencies, except 
          those noted in section 2(b) of this order. The Director of OMB 
          shall advise the President and the appropriate department or 
          agency head when there is a critical deficiency in the 
          security practices within the purview of this section in an 
          executive branch department or agency.
          (b) National Security Information Systems. The Secretary of 
          Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) shall 
          have responsibility to oversee, develop, and ensure 
          implementation of policies, principles, standards, and 
          guidelines for the security of information systems that 
          support the operations under their respective control. In 
          consultation with the Assistant to the President for National 
          Security Affairs and the affected departments and agencies, 
          the Secretary of Defense and the DCI shall develop policies, 
          principles, standards, and guidelines for the security of 
          national security information systems that support the 
          operations of other executive branch departments and agencies 
          with national security information.

  (i) Policies, principles, standards, and guidelines developed under this 
subsection may require more stringent protection than those developed in 
accordance with section 2(a) of this order.

  (ii) The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs shall 
advise the President and the appropriate department or agency when there is 
a critical deficiency in the security practices of a department or agency 
within the purview of this section.

  (iii) National Security Systems. The National Security Telecommunications 
and Information Systems Security Committee, as established by and 
consistent with NSD-42 and chaired by the Department of Defense, shall be 
designated as the ``Committee on National Security Systems.''

          (c) Additional Responsibilities. The heads of executive branch 
          departments and agencies are responsible and accountable for 
          providing and maintaining adequate levels of security for 
          information systems, including emergency preparedness 
          communications systems, for programs under their control. 
          Heads of such departments and agencies shall ensure the 
          development and, within available appropriations, funding of 
          programs that adequately address these mission systems, 
          especially those critical systems that support the national 
          security and other essential government programs. 
          Additionally, security should enable, and not unnecessarily 
          impede, department and agency business operations.
          Sec. 3. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council. The 
          National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), established 
          on October 16, 2001, shall provide the President through the 
          Secretary of Homeland Security with advice on the security of 
          information systems for critical infrastructure supporting 
          other sectors of the economy: banking and finance, 
          transportation, energy, manufacturing, and emergency 
          government services.
          (a) Membership. The NIAC shall be composed of not more than 30 
          members appointed by the President. The members of the NIAC 
          shall be selected from the private sector, academia, and State 
          and local government. Members of the NIAC shall have expertise 
          relevant to the functions of the

[[Page 169]]

          NIAC and generally shall be selected from industry Chief 
          Executive Officers (and equivalently ranked leaders of other 
          organizations) with responsibilities for security of 
          information infrastructure supporting the critical sectors of 
          the economy, including banking and finance, transportation, 
          energy, communications, and emergency government services. 
          Members shall not be full-time officials or employees of the 
          executive branch of the Federal Government. The President 
          shall designate a Chair and Vice Chair from among the members 
          of the NIAC.
          (b) Functions of the NIAC. The NIAC will meet periodically to:

reports on this issue to the Secretary of Homeland Security, as 
appropriate;

  (ii) propose and develop ways to encourage private industry to perform 
periodic risk assessments of critical information and telecommunications 
systems;

  (iii) monitor the development of private sector Information Sharing and

best foster improved cooperation among the ISACs, the Department of 
Homeland Security, and other Federal Government entities;

  (iv) report to the President through the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
who shall ensure appropriate coordination with the Assistant to the 
President for Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President for

of the NIAC, as appropriate.

  (iv) Members shall serve without compensation for their work on the NIAC. 
However, members may be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem

appropriations, the Department of Homeland Security shall provide the NIAC

EO 13287

Executive Order 13287 of March 3, 2003

Preserve America

          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
          and the laws of the United States of America, including the 
          National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) 
          (NHPA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 
          4321 et seq.), it is hereby ordered:
          Section 1. Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the 
          Federal Government to provide leadership in preserving 
          America's heritage by actively advancing the protection, 
          enhancement, and contemporary use of the historic properties 
          owned by the Federal Government, and by promoting 
          intergovernmental cooperation and partnerships for the 
          preservation and use of historic properties. The Federal 
          Government shall recognize and manage the historic properties 
          in its ownership as assets that can support department and 
          agency missions while contributing to the vitality and 
          economic well-being of the Nation's communities and fostering 
          a broader appreciation for the development of the United 
          States and its underlying values. Where consistent with 
          executive branch department and agency missions, governing 
          law, applicable preservation standards, and where appropriate, 
          executive branch departments and agencies (``agency'' or 
          ``agencies'') shall advance this policy through the protection 
          and continued use of the historic

[[Page 184]]

          properties owned by the Federal Government, and by pursuing 
          partnerships with State and local governments, Indian tribes, 
          and the private sector to promote the preservation of the 
          unique cultural heritage of communities and of the Nation and 
          to realize the economic benefit that these properties can 
          provide. Agencies shall maximize efforts to integrate the 
          policies, procedures, and practices of the NHPA and this order 
          into their program activities in order to efficiently and 
          effectively advance historic preservation objectives in the 
          pursuit of their missions.
          Sec. 2. Building Preservation Partnerships. When carrying out 
          its mission activities, each agency, where consistent with its 
          mission and governing authorities, and where appropriate, 
          shall seek partnerships with State and local governments, 
          Indian tribes, and the private sector to promote local 
          economic development and vitality through the use of historic 
          properties in a manner that contributes to the long-term 
          preservation and productive use of those properties. Each 
          agency shall examine its policies, procedures, and 
          capabilities to ensure that its actions encourage, support, 
          and foster public-private initiatives and investment in the 
          use, reuse, and rehabilitation of historic properties, to the 
          extent such support is not inconsistent with other provisions 
          of law, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for 
          Archeology and Historic Preservation, and essential national 
          department and agency mission requirements.
          Sec. 3. Improving Federal Agency Planning and Accountability. 
          (a) Accurate information on the state of Federally owned 
          historic properties is essential to achieving the goals of 
          this order and to promoting community economic development 
          through local partnerships. Each agency with real property 
          management responsibilities shall prepare an assessment of the 
          current status of its inventory of historic properties 
          required by section 110(a)(2) of the NHPA (16 U.S.C. 470h	
          2(a)(2)), the general condition and management needs of such 
          properties, and the steps underway or planned to meet those 
          management needs. The assessment shall also include an 
          evaluation of the suitability of the agency's types of 
          historic properties to contribute to community economic 
          development initiatives, including heritage tourism, taking 
          into account agency mission needs, public access 
          considerations, and the long-term preservation of the historic 
          properties. No later than September 30, 2004, each covered 
          agency shall complete a report of the assessment and make it 
          available to the Chairman of the Advisory Council on Historic 
          Preservation (Council) and the Secretary of the Interior 
          (Secretary).
          (b) No later than September 30, 2004, each agency with real 
          property management responsibilities shall review its 
          regulations, management policies, and operating procedures for 
          compliance with sections 110 and 111 of the NHPA (16 U.S.C. 
          470h	2 & 470	3) and make the results of its review available 
          to the Council and the Secretary. If the agency determines 
          that its regulations, management policies, and operating 
          procedures are not in compliance with those authorities, the 
          agency shall make amendments or revisions to bring them into 
          compliance.
          (c) Each agency with real property management responsibilities 
          shall, by September 30, 2005, and every third year thereafter, 
          prepare a report on its progress in identifying, protecting, 
          and using historic properties in its ownership and make the 
          report available to the Council and the Secretary. The Council 
          shall incorporate this data into a report on the state of the 
          Federal Government's historic properties and their 
          contribution to local economic

[[Page 185]]

          development and submit this report to the President by 
          February 15, 2006, and every third year thereafter.
          (d) Agencies may use existing information gathering and 
          reporting systems to fulfill the assessment and reporting 
          requirements of subsections 3(a)	(c) of this order. To assist 
          agencies, the Council, in consultation with the Secretary, 
          shall, by September 30, 2003, prepare advisory guidelines for 
          agencies to use at their discretion.
          (e) No later than June 30, 2003, the head of each agency shall 
          designate a senior policy level official to have policy 
          oversight responsibility for the agency's historic 
          preservation program and notify the Council and the Secretary 
          of the designation. This senior official shall be an assistant 
          secretary, deputy assistant secretary, or the equivalent, as 
          appropriate to the agency organization. This official, or a 
          subordinate employee reporting directly to the official, shall 
          serve as the agency's Federal Preservation Officer in 
          accordance with section 110(c) of the NHPA. The senior 
          official shall ensure that the Federal Preservation Officer is 
          qualified consistent with guidelines established by the 
          Secretary for that position and has access to adequate 
          expertise and support to carry out the duties of the position.
          Sec. 4. Improving Federal Stewardship of Historic Properties. 
          (a) Each agency shall ensure that the management of historic 
          properties in its ownership is conducted in a manner that 
          promotes the long-term preservation and use of those 
          properties as Federal assets and, where consistent with agency 
          missions, governing law, and the nature of the properties, 
          contributes to the local community and its economy.
          (b) Where consistent with agency missions and the Secretary of 
          the Interior's Standards for Archeology and Historic 
          Preservation, and where appropriate, agencies shall cooperate 
          with communities to increase opportunities for public benefit 
          from, and access to, Federally owned historic properties.
          (c) The Council is directed to use its existing authority to 
          encourage and accept donations of money, equipment, and other 
          resources from public and private parties to assist other 
          agencies in the preservation of historic properties in Federal 
          ownership to fulfill the goals of the NHPA and this order.
          (d) The National Park Service, working with the Council and in 
          consultation with other agencies, shall make available 
          existing materials and information for education, training, 
          and awareness of historic property stewardship to ensure that 
          all Federal personnel have access to information and can 
          develop the skills necessary to continue the productive use of 
          Federally owned historic properties while meeting their 
          stewardship responsibilities.
          (e) The Council, in consultation with the National Park 
          Service and other agencies, shall encourage and recognize 
          exceptional achievement by such agencies in meeting the goals 
          of the NHPA and this order. By March 31, 2004, the Council 
          shall submit to the President and the heads of agencies 
          recommendations to further stimulate initiative, creativity, 
          and efficiency in the Federal stewardship of historic 
          properties.
          Sec. 5. Promoting Preservation Through Heritage Tourism.
          (a) To the extent permitted by law and within existing 
          resources, the Secretary of Commerce, working with the Council 
          and other agencies, shall

[[Page 186]]

          assist States, Indian tribes, and local communities in 
          promoting the use of historic properties for heritage tourism 
          and related economic development in a manner that contributes 
          to the long-term preservation and productive use of those 
          properties. Such assistance shall include efforts to 
          strengthen and improve heritage tourism activities throughout 
          the country as they relate to Federally owned historic 
          properties and significant natural assets on Federal lands.
          (b) Where consistent with agency missions and governing law, 
          and where appropriate, agencies shall use historic properties 
          in their ownership in conjunction with State, tribal, and 
          local tourism programs to foster viable economic partnerships, 
          including, but not limited to, cooperation and coordination 
          with tourism officials and others with interests in the 
          properties.
          Sec. 6. National and Homeland Security Considerations.
          Nothing in this order shall be construed to require any agency 
          to take any action or disclose any information that would 
          conflict with or compromise national and homeland security 
          goals, policies, programs, or activities.
          Sec. 7. Definitions. For the purposes of this order, the term 
          ``historic property'' means any prehistoric or historic 
          district, site, building, structure, and object included on or 
          eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic 
          Places in accordance with section 301(5) of the NHPA (16 
          U.S.C. 470w(5)). The term ``heritage tourism'' means the 
          business and practice of attracting and accommodating visitors 
          to a place or area based especially on the unique or special 
          aspects of that locale's history, landscape (including trail 
          systems), and culture. The terms ``Federally owned'' and ``in 
          Federal ownership,'' and similar terms, as used in this order, 
          do not include properties acquired by agencies as a result of 
          foreclosure or similar actions and that are held for a period 
          of less than 5 years.
          Sec. 8. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to 
          improve the internal management of the Federal Government and 
          it is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
          benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
          equity by a party against the United States, its departments, 
          agencies, instrumentalities or entities, its officers or 
          employees, or any other person.

Further Amendment to Executive Order 12958, as Amended, Classified National 
Security Information

          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
          and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to 
          further amend Executive Order 12958, as amended, it is hereby 
          ordered that Executive Order 12958 is amended to read as 
          follows:
          ``Classified National Security Information
          This order prescribes a uniform system for classifying, 
          safeguarding, and declassifying national security information, 
          including information relating to defense against 
          transnational terrorism. Our democratic principles require 
          that the American people be informed of the activities of 
          their Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on the 
          free flow of information. Nevertheless, throughout our 
          history, the national defense has required that certain 
          information be maintained in confidence in order to protect 
          our citizens, our democratic institutions, our homeland 
          security, and our interactions with foreign nations. 
          Protecting information critical to our Nation's security 
          remains a priority.
          NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by 
          the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, 
          it is hereby ordered as follows:
          PART 1_ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION
          Sec. 1.1. Classification Standards. (a) Information may be 
          originally classified under the terms of this order only if 
          all of the following conditions are met:

(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information;

(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the 
control of the United States Government;

(3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of 
information listed in section 1.4 of this order; and

(4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized 
disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in 
damage to the national security, which includes defense against 
transnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able 
to identify or describe the damage.

          (b) Classified information shall not be declassified 
          automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of 
          identical or similar information.
          (c) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government 
          information is presumed to cause damage to the national 
          security.
          Sec. 1.2. Classification Levels. (a) Information may be 
          classified at one of the following three levels:

(1) ``Top Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally 
grave damage to the national security that the original classification 
authority is able to identify or describe.

[[Page 197]]

(2) ``Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure 
of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the 
national security that the original classification authority is able to 
identify or describe.

(3) ``Confidential'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the 
national security that the original classification authority is able to 
identify or describe.

          (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms 
          shall be used to identify United States classified 
          information.
          Sec. 1.3. Classification Authority. (a) The authority to 
          classify information originally may be exercised only by:

(1) the President and, in the performance of executive duties, the Vice 
President;

(2) agency heads and officials designated by the President in the Federal 
Register; and

(3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.

          (b) Officials authorized to classify information at a 
          specified level are also authorized to classify information at 
          a lower level.
          (c) Delegation of original classification authority.

(1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to 
the minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible 
for ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and 
continuing need to exercise this authority.

(2) ``Top Secret'' original classification authority may be delegated only 
by the President; in the performance of executive duties, the Vice 
President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.

(3) ``Secret'' or ``Confidential'' original classification authority may be 
delegated only by the President; in the performance of executive duties, 
the Vice President; or an agency head or official designated pursuant to 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or the senior agency official described 
in section 5.4(d) of this order, provided that official has been delegated 
``Top Secret'' original classification authority by the agency head.

(4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in 
writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in 
this order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or position 
title.

          (d) Original classification authorities must receive training 
          in original classification as provided in this order and its 
          implementing directives. Such training must include 
          instruction on the proper safeguarding of classified 
          information and of the criminal, civil, and administrative 
          sanctions that may be brought against an individual who fails 
          to protect classified information from unauthorized 
          disclosure.
          (e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government 
          contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an 
          agency who does not have original classification authority 
          originates information believed by that person

[[Page 198]]

          to require classification, the information shall be protected 
          in a manner consistent with this order and its implementing 
          directives. The information shall be transmitted promptly as 
          provided under this order or its implementing directives to 
          the agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and 
          classification authority with respect to this information. 
          That agency shall decide within 30 days whether to classify 
          this information. If it is not clear which agency has 
          classification responsibility for this information, it shall 
          be sent to the Director of the Information Security Oversight 
          Office. The Director shall determine the agency having primary 
          subject matter interest and forward the information, with 
          appropriate recommendations, to that agency for a 
          classification determination.
          Sec. 1.4. Classification Categories. Information shall not be 
          considered for classification unless it concerns:
          (a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;
          (b) foreign government information;
          (c) intelligence activities (including special activities), 
          intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;
          (d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United 
          States, including confidential sources;
          (e) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to 
          the national security, which includes defense against 
          transnational terrorism;
          (f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear 
          materials or facilities;
          (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, 
          infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services 
          relating to the national security, which includes defense 
          against transnational terrorism; or
          (h) weapons of mass destruction.
          Sec. 1.5. Duration of Classification. (a) At the time of 
          original classification, the original classification authority 
          shall attempt to establish a specific date or event for 
          declassification based upon the duration of the national 
          security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the 
          date or event, the information shall be automatically 
          declassified. The date or event shall not exceed the time 
          frame established in paragraph (b) of this section.
          (b) If the original classification authority cannot determine 
          an earlier specific date or event for declassification, 
          information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from 
          the date of the original decision, unless the original 
          classification authority otherwise determines that the 
          sensitivity of the information requires that it shall be 
          marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date 
          of the original decision. All information classified under 
          this section shall be subject to section 3.3 of this order if 
          it is contained in records of permanent historical value under 
          title 44, United States Code.
          (c) An original classification authority may extend the 
          duration of classification, change the level of 
          classification, or reclassify specific information only when 
          the standards and procedures for classifying information under 
          this order are followed.

[[Page 199]]

          (d) Information marked for an indefinite duration of 
          classification under predecessor orders, for example, marked 
          as ``Originating Agency's Determination Required,'' or 
          information classified under predecessor orders that contains 
          no declassification instructions shall be declassified in 
          accordance with part 3 of this order.
          Sec. 1.6. Identification and Markings. (a) At the time of 
          original classification, the following shall appear on the 
          face of each classified document, or shall be applied to other 
          classified media in an appropriate manner:

(1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2 of this 
order;

(2) the identity, by name or personal identifier and position, of the 
original classification authority;

(3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident;

(4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of the 
following:

(A)

 the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in section 1.5(a) or 
section 1.5(c);

(B)

 the date that is 10 years from the date of original classification, as 
prescribed in section 1.5(b); or

(C)

 the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original classification, 
as prescribed in section 1.5 (b); and

(5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the 
applicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this order.

          (b) Specific information described in paragraph (a) of this 
          section may be excluded if it would reveal additional 
          classified information.
          (c) With respect to each classified document, the agency 
          originating the document shall, by marking or other means, 
          indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable 
          classification level, and which portions are unclassified. In 
          accordance with standards prescribed in directives issued 
          under this order, the Director of the Information Security 
          Oversight Office may grant waivers of this requirement. The 
          Director shall revoke any waiver upon a finding of abuse.
          (d) Markings implementing the provisions of this order, 
          including abbreviations and requirements to safeguard 
          classified working papers, shall conform to the standards 
          prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this 
          order.
          (e) Foreign government information shall retain its original 
          classification markings or shall be assigned a U.S. 
          classification that provides a degree of protection at least 
          equivalent to that required by the entity that furnished the 
          information. Foreign government information retaining its 
          original classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. 
          classification marking provided that the responsible agency 
          determines that the foreign government markings are adequate 
          to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings.
          (f) Information assigned a level of classification under this 
          or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at 
          that level of classification despite the omission of other 
          required markings. Whenever such information is

[[Page 200]]

          used in the derivative classification process or is reviewed 
          for possible declassification, holders of such information 
          shall coordinate with an appropriate classification authority 
          for the application of omitted markings.
          (g) The classification authority shall, whenever practicable, 
          use a classified addendum whenever classified information 
          constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified 
          document.
          (h) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be 
          appropriately marked to reflect their declassification.
          Sec. 1.7. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations.
          (a) In no case shall information be classified in order to:

(1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;

(2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;

(3) restrain competition; or

(4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require 
protection in the interest of the national security.

          (b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related 
          to the national security shall not be classified.
          (c) Information may be reclassified after declassification and 
          release to the public under proper authority only in 
          accordance with the following conditions:

(1) the reclassification action is taken under the personal authority of 
the agency head or deputy agency head, who determines in writing that the 
reclassification of the information is necessary in the interest of the 
national security;

(2) the information may be reasonably recovered; and

(3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office.

          (d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the 
          public under proper authority may be classified or 
          reclassified after an agency has received a request for it 
          under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or the 
          Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review 
          provisions of section 3.5 of this order only if such 
          classification meets the requirements of this order and is 
          accomplished on a document-by-document basis with the personal 
          participation or under the direction of the agency head, the 
          deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated 
          under section 5.4 of this order.
          (e) Compilations of items of information that are individually 
          unclassified may be classified if the compiled information 
          reveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) 
          meets the standards for classification under this order; and 
          (2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of 
          information. As used in this order, ``compilation'' means an 
          aggregation of pre-existing unclassified items of information.
          Sec. 1.8. Classification Challenges. (a) Authorized holders of 
          information who, in good faith, believe that its 
          classification status is improper are encouraged and expected 
          to challenge the classification status of the information in 
          accordance with agency procedures established under paragraph 
          (b) of this section.

[[Page 201]]

          (b) In accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant 
          to this order, an agency head or senior agency official shall 
          establish procedures under which authorized holders of 
          information are encouraged and expected to challenge the 
          classification of information that they believe is improperly 
          classified or unclassified. These procedures shall ensure 
          that:

(1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions;

(2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial official or 
panel; and

(3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency decisions to 
the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) established 
by section 5.3 of this order.

          PART 2_DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION
          Sec. 2.1. Use of Derivative Classification. (a) Persons who 
          only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, 
          or who only apply classification markings derived from source 
          material or as directed by a classification guide, need not 
          possess original classification authority.
          (b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings 
          shall:

(1) observe and respect original classification decisions; and

(2) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent 
classification markings. For information derivatively classified based on 
multiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:

(A)

 the date or event for declassification that corresponds to the longest 
period of classification among the sources; and

(B)

 a listing of these sources on or attached to the official file or record 
copy.

          Sec. 2.2. Classification Guides. (a) Agencies with original 
          classification authority shall prepare classification guides 
          to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification 
          of information. These guides shall conform to standards 
          contained in directives issued under this order.
          (b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in writing by 
          an official who:

(1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is 
the senior agency official; and

(2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level 
of classification prescribed in the guide.

          (c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure that 
          classification guides are reviewed and updated as provided in 
          directives issued under this order.

          PART 3_DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING
          Sec. 3.1. Authority for Declassification. (a) Information 
          shall be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the 
          standards for classification under this order.
          (b) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the 
          classification requirements under this order requires 
          continued protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the 
          need to protect such information may be outweighed by the 
          public interest in disclosure of the information, and in

[[Page 202]]

          these cases the information should be declassified. When such 
          questions arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or 
          the senior agency official. That official will determine, as 
          an exercise of discretion, whether the public interest in 
          disclosure outweighs the damage to the national security that 
          might reasonably be expected from disclosure. This provision 
          does not:

(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for 
classification; or

(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.

          (c) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight 
          Office determines that information is classified in violation 
          of this order, the Director may require the information to be 
          declassified by the agency that originated the classification. 
          Any such decision by the Director may be appealed to the 
          President through the Assistant to the President for National 
          Security Affairs. The information shall remain classified 
          pending a prompt decision on the appeal.
          (d) The provisions of this section shall also apply to 
          agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not have 
          original classification authority, but had such authority 
          under predecessor orders.
          Sec. 3.2. Transferred Records. (a) In the case of classified 
          records transferred in conjunction with a transfer of 
          functions, and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving 
          agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency for 
          purposes of this order.
          (b) In the case of classified records that are not officially 
          transferred as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but 
          that originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for 
          which there is no successor agency, each agency in possession 
          of such records shall be deemed to be the originating agency 
          for purposes of this order. Such records may be declassified 
          or downgraded by the agency in possession after consultation 
          with any other agency that has an interest in the subject 
          matter of the records.
          (c) Classified records accessioned into the National Archives 
          and Records Administration (National Archives) as of the 
          effective date of this order shall be declassified or 
          downgraded by the Archivist of the United States (Archivist) 
          in accordance with this order, the directives issued pursuant 
          to this order, agency declassification guides, and any 
          existing procedural agreement between the Archivist and the 
          relevant agency head.
          (d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to 
          declassify classified information contained in records 
          determined to have permanent historical value before they are 
          accessioned into the National Archives. However, the Archivist 
          may require that classified records be accessioned into the 
          National Archives when necessary to comply with the provisions 
          of the Federal Records Act. This provision does not apply to 
          records being transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 
          2203 of title 44, United States Code, or records for which the 
          National Archives serves as the custodian of the records of an 
          agency or organization that has gone out of existence.
          (e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt a system 
          of records management that will facilitate the public release 
          of documents at the time such documents are declassified 
          pursuant to the provisions for automatic declassification in 
          section 3.3 of this order.

[[Page 203]]

          Sec. 3.3. Automatic Declassification. (a) Subject to 
          paragraphs (b)	(e) of this section, on December 31, 2006, all 
          classified records that (1) are more than 25 years old and (2) 
          have been determined to have permanent historical value under 
          title 44, United States Code, shall be automatically 
          declassified whether or not the records have been reviewed. 
          Subsequently, all classified records shall be automatically 
          declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from 
          the date of its original classification, except as provided in 
          paragraphs (b)	(e) of this section.
          (b) An agency head may exempt from automatic declassification 
          under paragraph (a) of this section specific information, the 
          release of which could be expected to:

(1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or a human 
intelligence source, or reveal information about the application of an 
intelligence source or method;

(2) reveal information that would assist in the development or use of 
weapons of mass destruction;

(3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or 
activities;

(4) reveal information that would impair the application of state of the 
art technology within a U.S. weapon system;

(5) reveal actual U.S. military war plans that remain in effect;

(6) reveal information, including foreign government information, that 
would seriously and demonstrably impair relations between the United States 
and a foreign government, or seriously and demonstrably undermine ongoing 
diplomatic activities of the United States;

(7) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably impair the 
current ability of United States Government officials to protect the 
President, Vice President, and other protectees for whom protection 
services, in the interest of the national security, are authorized;

(8) reveal information that would seriously and demonstrably impair current 
national security emergency preparedness plans or reveal current 
vulnerabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, or projects 
relating to the national security; or

(9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement.

          (c) An agency head shall notify the President through the 
          Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs of 
          any specific file series of records for which a review or 
          assessment has determined that the information within that 
          file series almost invariably falls within one or more of the 
          exemption categories listed in paragraph (b) of this section 
          and which the agency proposes to exempt from automatic 
          declassification. The notification shall include:

(1) a description of the file series;

(2) an explanation of why the information within the file series is almost 
invariably exempt from automatic declassification and why the information 
must remain classified for a longer period of time; and

(3) except for the identity of a confidential human source or a human 
intelligence source, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
specific date or event for declassification of the information. The 
President

[[Page 204]]

may direct the agency head not to exempt the file series or to declassify 
the information within that series at an earlier date than recommended. 
File series exemptions previously approved by the President shall remain 
valid without any additional agency action.

          (d) At least 180 days before information is automatically 
          declassified under this section, an agency head or senior 
          agency official shall notify the Director of the Information 
          Security Oversight Office, serving as Executive Secretary of 
          the Panel, of any specific information beyond that included in 
          a notification to the President under paragraph (c) of this 
          section that the agency proposes to exempt from automatic 
          declassification. The notification shall include:

(1) a description of the information, either by reference to information in 
specific records or in the form of a declassification guide;

(2) an explanation of why the information is exempt from automatic 
declassification and must remain classified for a longer period of time; 
and

(3) except for the identity of a confidential human source or a human 
intelligence source, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a 
specific date or event for declassification of the information. The Panel 
may direct the agency not to exempt the information or to declassify it at 
an earlier date than recommended. The agency head may appeal such a 
decision to the President through the Assistant to the President for 
National Security Affairs. The information will remain classified while 
such an appeal is pending.

          (e) The following provisions shall apply to the onset of 
          automatic declassification:

(1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined in this 
order, that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under this 
section shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the 
year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the 
file block.

(2) By notification to the Director of the Information Security Oversight 
Office, before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an 
agency head or senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this 
order may delay automatic declassification for up to 5 additional years for 
classified information contained in microforms, motion pictures, 
audiotapes, videotapes, or comparable media that make a review for possible 
declassification exemptions more difficult or costly.

(3) By notification to the Director of the Information Security Oversight 
Office, before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an 
agency head or senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this 
order may delay automatic declassification for up to 3 years for classified 
records that have been referred or transferred to that agency by another 
agency less than 3 years before automatic declassification would otherwise 
be required.

(4) By notification to the Director of the Information Security Oversight 
Office, an agency head or senior agency official designated under section 
5.4 of this order may delay automatic declassification for up to 3 years 
from the date of discovery of classified records that were inadvertently 
not reviewed prior to the effective date of automatic declassification.

[[Page 205]]

          (f) Information exempted from automatic declassification under 
          this section shall remain subject to the mandatory and 
          systematic declassification review provisions of this order.
          (g) The Secretary of State shall determine when the United 
          States should commence negotiations with the appropriate 
          officials of a foreign government or international 
          organization of governments to modify any treaty or 
          international agreement that requires the classification of 
          information contained in records affected by this section for 
          a period longer than 25 years from the date of its creation, 
          unless the treaty or international agreement pertains to 
          information that may otherwise remain classified beyond 25 
          years under this section.
          (h) Records containing information that originated with other 
          agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests 
          or activities of other agencies shall be referred for review 
          to those agencies and the information of concern shall be 
          subject to automatic declassification only by those agencies, 
          consistent with the provisions of subparagraphs (e)(3) and 
          (e)(4) of this section.
          Sec. 3.4. Systematic Declassification Review. (a) Each agency 
          that has originated classified information under this order or 
          its predecessors shall establish and conduct a program for 
          systematic declassification review. This program shall apply 
          to records of permanent historical value exempted from 
          automatic declassification under section 3.3 of this order. 
          Agencies shall prioritize the systematic review of records 
          based upon the degree of researcher interest and the 
          likelihood of declassification upon review.
          (b) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic declassification 
          review program for classified records: (1) accessioned into 
          the National Archives as of the effective date of this order; 
          (2) transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 of 
          title 44, United States Code; and (3) for which the National 
          Archives serves as the custodian for an agency or organization 
          that has gone out of existence. This program shall apply to 
          pertinent records no later than 25 years from the date of 
          their creation. The Archivist shall establish priorities for 
          the systematic review of these records based upon the degree 
          of researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification 
          upon review. These records shall be reviewed in accordance 
          with the standards of this order, its implementing directives, 
          and declassification guides provided to the Archivist by each 
          agency that originated the records. The Director of the 
          Information Security Oversight Office shall ensure that 
          agencies provide the Archivist with adequate and current 
          declassification guides.
          (c) After consultation with affected agencies, the Secretary 
          of Defense may establish special procedures for systematic 
          review for declassification of classified cryptologic 
          information, and the Director of Central Intelligence may 
          establish special procedures for systematic review for 
          declassification of classified information pertaining to 
          intelligence activities (including special activities), or 
          intelligence sources or methods.
          Sec. 3.5. Mandatory Declassification Review. (a) Except as 
          provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all information 
          classified under this order or predecessor orders shall be 
          subject to a review for declassification by the originating 
          agency if:

[[Page 206]]

(1) the request for a review describes the document or material containing 
the information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to locate 
it with a reasonable amount of effort;

(2) the information is not exempted from search and review under sections 
105C, 105D, or 701 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 403-5c, 
403-5e, and 431); and

(3) the information has not been reviewed for declassification within the 
past 2 years. If the agency has reviewed the information within the past 2 
years, or the information is the subject of pending litigation, the agency 
shall inform the requester of this fact and of the requester's appeal 
rights.

          (b) Information originated by:

(1) the incumbent President or, in the performance of executive duties, the 
incumbent Vice President;

(2) the incumbent President's White House Staff or, in the performance of 
executive duties, the incumbent Vice President's Staff;

(3) committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent 
President; or

(4) other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely 
advise and assist the incumbent President is exempted from the provisions 
of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the Archivist shall have the 
authority to review, downgrade, and declassify papers or records of former 
Presidents under the control of the Archivist pursuant to sections 2107, 
2111, 2111 note, or 2203 of title 44, United States Code. Review procedures 
developed by the Archivist shall provide for consultation with agencies 
having primary subject matter interest and shall be consistent with the 
provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements that pertain to the 
respective Presidential papers or records. Agencies with primary subject 
matter interest shall be notified promptly of the Archivist's decision. Any 
final decision by the Archivist may be appealed by the requester or an 
agency to the Panel. The information shall remain classified pending a 
prompt decision on the appeal.

          (c) Agencies conducting a mandatory review for 
          declassification shall declassify information that no longer 
          meets the standards for classification under this order. They 
          shall release this information unless withholding is otherwise 
          authorized and warranted under applicable law.
          (d) In accordance with directives issued pursuant to this 
          order, agency heads shall develop procedures to process 
          requests for the mandatory review of classified information. 
          These procedures shall apply to information classified under 
          this or predecessor orders. They also shall provide a means 
          for administratively appealing a denial of a mandatory review 
          request, and for notifying the requester of the right to 
          appeal a final agency decision to the Panel.
          (e) After consultation with affected agencies, the Secretary 
          of Defense shall develop special procedures for the review of 
          cryptologic information; the Director of Central Intelligence 
          shall develop special procedures for the review of information 
          pertaining to intelligence activities (including special 
          activities), or intelligence sources or methods; and the 
          Archivist shall develop special procedures for the review of 
          information accessioned into the National Archives.

          Sec. 3.6. Processing Requests and Reviews. In response to a 
          request for information under the Freedom of Information Act, 
          the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of 
          this order, or pursuant to the automatic declassification or 
          systematic review provisions of this order:
          (a) An agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or 
          nonexistence of requested records whenever the fact of their 
          existence or nonexistence is itself classified under this 
          order or its predecessors.
          (b) When an agency receives any request for documents in its 
          custody that contain information that was originally 
          classified by another agency, or comes across such documents 
          in the process of the automatic declassification or systematic 
          review provisions of this order, it shall refer copies of any 
          request and the pertinent documents to the originating agency 
          for processing, and may, after consultation with the 
          originating agency, inform any requester of the referral 
          unless such association is itself classified under this order 
          or its predecessors. In cases in which the originating agency 
          determines in writing that a response under paragraph (a) of 
          this section is required, the referring agency shall respond 
          to the requester in accordance with that paragraph.
          Sec. 3.7. Declassification Database. (a) The Director of the 
          Information Security Oversight Office, in conjunction with 
          those agencies that originate classified information, shall 
          coordinate the linkage and effective utilization of existing 
          agency databases of records that have been declassified and 
          publicly released.
          (b) Agency heads shall fully cooperate with the Director of 
          the Information Security Oversight Office in these efforts.

          PART 4_SAFEGUARDING
          Sec. 4.1. General Restrictions on Access. (a) A person may 
          have access to classified information provided that:

(1) a favorable determination of eligibility for access has been made by an 
agency head or the agency head's designee;

(2) the person has signed an approved nondisclosure agreement; and

(3) the person has a need-to-know the information.

          (b) Every person who has met the standards for access to 
          classified information in paragraph (a) of this section shall 
          receive contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of 
          classified information and on the criminal, civil, and 
          administrative sanctions that may be imposed on an individual 
          who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized 
          disclosure.
          (c) Classified information shall remain under the control of 
          the originating agency or its successor in function. An agency 
          shall not disclose information originally classified by 
          another agency without its authorization. An official or 
          employee leaving agency service may not remove classified 
          information from the agency's control.
          (d) Classified information may not be removed from official 
          premises without proper authorization.
          (e) Persons authorized to disseminate classified information 
          outside the executive branch shall ensure the protection of 
          the information in a manner equivalent to that provided within 
          the executive branch.

[[Page 208]]

          (f) Consistent with law, directives, and regulation, an agency 
          head or senior agency official shall establish uniform 
          procedures to ensure that automated information systems, 
          including networks and telecommunications systems, that 
          collect, create, communicate, compute, disseminate, process, 
          or store classified information have controls that:

(1) prevent access by unauthorized persons; and

(2) ensure the integrity of the information.

          (g) Consistent with law, directives, and regulation, each 
          agency head or senior agency official shall establish controls 
          to ensure that classified information is used, processed, 
          stored, reproduced, transmitted, and destroyed under 
          conditions that provide adequate protection and prevent access 
          by unauthorized persons.
          (h) Consistent with directives issued pursuant to this order, 
          an agency shall safeguard foreign government information under 
          standards that provide a degree of protection at least 
          equivalent to that required by the government or international 
          organization of governments that furnished the information. 
          When adequate to achieve equivalency, these standards may be 
          less restrictive than the safeguarding standards that 
          ordinarily apply to United States ``Confidential'' 
          information, including modified handling and transmission and 
          allowing access to individuals with a need-to-know who have 
          not otherwise been cleared for access to classified 
          information or executed an approved nondisclosure agreement.
          (i) Except as otherwise provided by statute, this order, 
          directives implementing this order, or by direction of the 
          President, classified information originating in one agency 
          shall not be disseminated outside any other agency to which it 
          has been made available without the consent of the originating 
          agency. An agency head or senior agency official may waive 
          this requirement for specific information originated within 
          that agency. For purposes of this section, the Department of 
          Defense shall be considered one agency. Prior consent is not 
          required when referring records for declassification review 
          that contain information originating in several agencies.
          Sec. 4.2. Distribution Controls. (a) Each agency shall 
          establish controls over the distribution of classified 
          information to ensure that it is distributed only to 
          organizations or individuals eligible for access and with a 
          need-to-know the information.
          (b) In an emergency, when necessary to respond to an imminent 
          threat to life or in defense of the homeland, the agency head 
          or any designee may authorize the disclosure of classified 
          information to an individual or individuals who are otherwise 
          not eligible for access. Such actions shall be taken only in 
          accordance with the directives implementing this order and any 
          procedures issued by agencies governing the classified 
          information, which shall be designed to minimize the 
          classified information that is disclosed under these 
          circumstances and the number of individuals who receive it. 
          Information disclosed under this provision or implementing 
          directives and procedures shall not be deemed declassified as 
          a result of such disclosure or subsequent use by a recipient. 
          Such disclosures shall be reported promptly to the originator 
          of the classified information. For purposes of this section, 
          the Director of Central Intelligence may issue an implementing 
          directive governing the emergency disclosure of classified 
          intelligence information.

[[Page 209]]

          (c) Each agency shall update, at least annually, the 
          automatic, routine, or recurring distribution of classified 
          information that they distribute. Recipients shall cooperate 
          fully with distributors who are updating distribution lists 
          and shall notify distributors whenever a relevant change in 
          status occurs.
          Sec. 4.3. Special Access Programs. (a) Establishment of 
          special access programs. Unless otherwise authorized by the 
          President, only the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, 
          and the Director of Central Intelligence, or the principal 
          deputy of each, may create a special access program. For 
          special access programs pertaining to intelligence activities 
          (including special activities, but not including military 
          operational, strategic, and tactical programs), or 
          intelligence sources or methods, this function shall be 
          exercised by the Director of Central Intelligence. These 
          officials shall keep the number of these programs at an 
          absolute minimum, and shall establish them only when the 
          program is required by statute or upon a specific finding 
          that:

(1) the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is 
exceptional; and

(2) the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access applicable 
to information classified at the same level are not deemed sufficient to 
protect the information from unauthorized disclosure.

          (b) Requirements and limitations. (1) Special access programs 
          shall be limited to programs in which the number of persons 
          who will have access ordinarily will be reasonably small and 
          commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced 
          protection for the information involved.

(2) Each agency head shall establish and maintain a system of accounting 
for special access programs consistent with directives issued pursuant to 
this order.

(3) Special access programs shall be subject to the oversight program 
established under section 5.4(d) of this order. In addition, the Director 
of the Information Security Oversight Office shall be afforded access to 
these programs, in accordance with the security requirements of each 
program, in order to perform the functions assigned to the Information 
Security Oversight Office under this order. An agency head may limit access 
to a special access program to the Director and no more than one other 
employee of the Information Security Oversight Office, or, for special 
access programs that are extraordinarily sensitive and vulnerable, to the 
Director only.

(4) The agency head or principal deputy shall review annually each special 
access program to determine whether it continues to meet the requirements 
of this order.

(5) Upon request, an agency head shall brief the Assistant to the President 
for National Security Affairs, or a designee, on any or all of the agency's 
special access programs.

          (c) Nothing in this order shall supersede any requirement made 
          by or under 10 U.S.C. 119.
          Sec. 4.4. Access by Historical Researchers and Certain Former 
          Government Personnel. (a) The requirement in section 4.1(a)(3) 
          of this order that access to classified information may be 
          granted only to individuals who have a need-to-know the 
          information may be waived for persons who:

[[Page 210]]

(1) are engaged in historical research projects;

(2) previously have occupied policy-making positions to which they were 
appointed by the President under section 105(a)(2)(A) of title 3, United 
States Code, or the Vice President under 106(a)(1)(A) of title 3, United 
States Code; or

(3) served as President or Vice President.

          (b) Waivers under this section may be granted only if the 
          agency head or senior agency official of the originating 
          agency:

(1) determines in writing that access is consistent with the interest of 
the national security;

(2) takes appropriate steps to protect classified information from 
unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the information is 
safeguarded in a manner consistent with this order; and

(3) limits the access granted to former Presidential appointees and Vice 
Presidential appointees to items that the person originated, reviewed, 
signed, or received while serving as a Presidential appointee or a Vice 
Presidential appointee.

          PART 5_IMPLEMENTATION AND REVIEW
          Sec. 5.1. Program Direction. (a) The Director of the 
          Information Security Oversight Office, under the direction of 
          the Archivist and in consultation with the Assistant to the

information, and other cooperation that may be necessary to fulfill its 
responsibilities. If granting access to specific categories of classified 
information would pose an exceptional national security risk, the affected 
agency head or the senior agency official shall submit a written 
justification recommending the denial of access to the President through 
the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs within 60 days 
of the request for access. Access shall be denied pending the response;

(5) review requests for original classification authority from agencies or 
officials not granted original classification authority and, if deemed

order; and

(9) convene and chair interagency meetings to discuss matters pertaining to 
the program established by this order.

          Sec. 5.3. Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.
          (a) Establishment and administration.

(1) There is established an Interagency Security Classification Appeals 
Panel. The Departments of State, Defense, and Justice, the Central 
Intelligence Agency, the National Archives, and the Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs shall each be represented by a 
senior-level representative who is a full-time or permanent part-time 
Federal officer or employee designated to serve as a member of the Panel by 
the respective agency head. The President shall select the Chair of the 
Panel from among the Panel members.

(2) A vacancy on the Panel shall be filled as quickly as possible as

          establish the rules and procedures that the Panel will follow 
          in accepting, considering, and issuing decisions on appeals. 
          The rules and procedures of the Panel shall provide that the 
          Panel will consider appeals only on actions in which:

  (1) the appellant has exhausted his or her administrative remedies within 
the responsible agency;

  (2) there is no current action pending on the issue within the Federal 
courts; and

  (3) the information has not been the subject of review by the Federal 
courts or the Panel within the past 2 years.

          (d) Agency heads shall cooperate fully with the Panel so that 
          it can fulfill its functions in a timely and fully informed 
          manner. An agency head may appeal a decision of the Panel to 
          the President through the Assistant to the President for 
          National Security Affairs. The Panel shall report to the 
          President through the Assistant to the President for National 
          Security Affairs any instance in which it believes that an 
          agency head is not cooperating fully with the Panel.
          (e) The Panel is established for the sole purpose of advising 
          and assisting the President in the discharge of his 
          constitutional and discretionary authority to protect the 
          national security of the United States. Panel decisions are 
          committed to the discretion of the Panel, unless changed by 
          the President.
          (f) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (e) of this 
          section, whenever the Panel reaches a conclusion that 
          information owned or controlled by the Director of Central 
          Intelligence (Director) should be declassified, and the 
          Director notifies the Panel that he objects to its conclusion 
          because he has determined that the information could 
          reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national 
          security and to reveal (1) the identity of a human 
          intelligence source, or (2) information about the application 
          of an intelligence source or method (including any information 
          that concerns, or is provided as a result of, a relationship 
          with a cooperating intelligence element of a foreign 
          government), the information shall remain classified unless 
          the Director's determination is appealed to the President, and 
          the President reverses the determination.

          originate or handle classified information shall:

EO 13304

Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003

Termination of Emergencies With Respect to Yugoslavia and Modification of 
Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001

          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
          and the laws of the United States of America, including the 
          International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as amended (50 
          U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 
          U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 5 of the United Nations 
          Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c) (UNPA), 
          and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
          I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, 
          have determined that the situations that gave rise to the 
          declarations of national emergencies in Executive Order 12808 
          of May 30, 1992, and Executive Order 13088 of June 9, 1998, 
          with respect to the former Socialist Federal Republic of 
          Yugoslavia, have been significantly altered by the peaceful 
          transition to democracy and other positive developments in 
          Serbia and

[[Page 230]]

          Montenegro (formerly the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
          (Serbia and Montenegro)). Accordingly, I hereby terminate the 
          national emergencies declared in those orders and revoke those 
          and all related orders (Executive Orders 12810 of June 5, 
          1992, 12831 of January 15, 1993, 12846 of April 25, 1993, 
          12934 of October 25, 1994, 13121 of April 30, 1999, and 13192 
          of January 17, 2001). At the same time, and in order to take 
          additional steps with respect to continuing, widespread, and 
          illicit actions that obstruct implementation of the Ohrid 
          Framework Agreement of 2001, relating to Macedonia, United 
          Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of June 10, 1999, 
          relating to Kosovo, or the Dayton Accords or the Conclusions 
          of the Peace Implementation Conference Council held in London 
          on December 8	9, 1995, including the decisions or conclusions 
          of the High Representative, the Peace Implementation Council 
          or its Steering Board, relating to Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
          including the harboring of individuals indicted by the 
          International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and 
          the national emergency described and declared in Executive 
          Order 13219 of June 26, 2001, I hereby order:
          Section 1. Pursuant to section 202 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 
          1622), termination of the national emergencies declared in 
          Executive Order 12808 of May 30, 1992, and Executive Order 
          13088 of June 9, 1998, shall not affect any action taken or 
          proceeding pending not finally concluded or determined as of 
          the effective date of this order, or any action or proceeding 
          based on any act committed prior to such date, or any rights 
          or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred prior 
          to such date. Pursuant to section 207 of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 
          1706), I hereby determine that the continuation of 
          prohibitions with regard to transactions involving any 
          property blocked pursuant to Executive Orders 12808 or 13088 
          that continues to be blocked as of the effective date of this 
          order is necessary on account of claims involving successor 
          states to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
          or other potential claimants.
          Sec. 2. The Annex to Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001, 
          is replaced and superseded in its entirety by the Annex to 
          this order.
          Sec. 3. (a) Section 1(a) and 1(b) of Executive Order 13219 are 
          revised to read as follows:
          ``Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 
          203(b)(1), (3), and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), 
          and (4)), and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export 
          Enhancement Act of 2000 (Title IX, Public Law 106	387), and in 
          regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may 
          hereafter be issued pursuant to this order, and 
          notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or 
          permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all 
          property and interests in property of:
          (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
          (ii) persons designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
          consultation with the Secretary of State, because they are 
          determined:
          (A) to be under open indictment by the International Criminal 
          Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, unless circumstances 
          warrant otherwise, or
          (B) to have committed, or to pose a significant risk of 
          committing, acts of violence that have the purpose or effect 
          of threatening the peace in or

[[Page 231]]

          diminishing the stability or security of any area or state in 
          the Western Balkans region, undermining the authority, 
          efforts, or objectives of international organizations or 
          entities present in the region, or endangering the safety of 
          persons participating in or providing support to the 
          activities of those international organizations or entities, 
          or
          (C) to have actively obstructed, or pose a significant risk of 
          actively obstructing, the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 
          relating to Macedonia, United Nations Security Council 
          Resolution 1244 relating to Kosovo, or the Dayton Accords or 
          the Conclusions of the Peace Implementation Conference held in 
          London on December 8	9, 1995, including the decisions or 
          conclusions of the High Representative, the Peace 
          Implementation Council or its Steering Board, relating to 
          Bosnia and Herzegovina, or
          (D) to have materially assisted in, sponsored, or provided 
          financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or 
          services in support of, such acts of violence or 
          obstructionism or any person listed in or designated pursuant 
          to this order, or
          (E) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to 
          act directly or indirectly for or on behalf of, any person 
          listed in or designated pursuant to this order, that are or 
          hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
          hereafter come within the possession or control of United 
          States persons, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, 
          exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.
          (b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the 
          type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 
          1702(b)(2)) by or to persons determined to be subject to the 
          sanctions imposed under this order would seriously impair the 
          ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this 
          order, and hereby prohibit such donations as provided in 
          paragraph (a) of this section.''
          Sec. 4. New sections 7 and 8 are added to Executive Order 
          13219 to read as follows:
          ``Sec. 7. For those persons listed in the Annex to this order 
          or determined to be subject to the sanctions imposed under 
          this order who might have a constitutional presence in the 
          United States, I have determined that, because of the ability 
          to transfer funds or assets instantaneously, prior notice to 
          such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order 
          would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine 
          that for these measures to be effective in addressing the 
          national emergency declared in this order, there need be no 
          prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to 
          this order.
          Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
          the Secretary of State, is authorized to determine, subsequent 
          to the issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer 
          warrant inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and 
          that such person is therefore no longer covered within the 
          scope of the sanctions set forth herein. Such a determination 
          shall become effective upon publication in the Federal 
          Register.''
          Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
          the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such 
          actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, 
          and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and 
          UNPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this 
          order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of 
          these

[[Page 232]]

          functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
          Government. All agencies of the United States Government are 
          hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their 
          authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, where 
          appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a 
          timely manner of the measures taken.
          Sec. 6. Nothing contained in this order shall create any right 
          or benefit or privilege, substantive or procedural, 
          enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the 
          United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers 
          or employees, or any other person.
          Sec. 7. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight 
          time on May 29, 2003. This order shall be transmitted to the

          in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997;
          I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, 
          hereby order:
          Section 1. Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1),

          States persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked 
          and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
          otherwise dealt in:
          (a) the persons listed in the Annex attached and made a part 
          of this order; and
          (b) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
          consultation with the Secretary of State,

(i)

 to be a senior official of the Government of Burma, the State Peace and 
Development Council of Burma, the Union Solidarity and Development 
Association of Burma, or any successor entity to any of the foregoing; or

(ii)

 to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on 
behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

          Sec. 2. Except to the extent provided in section 203(b) of 
          IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)), the TSRA, or regulations, orders,

          and
          (b) any approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee by a 
          United States person, wherever located, of a transaction by a 
          foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person 
          would be prohibited by this order if performed by a United 
          States person or within the United States;
          Sec. 3. Beginning 30 days after the effective date of this 
          order, and except to the extent provided in section 8 of this 
          order and in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that 
          may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any 
          contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior 
          to 30 days after the effective date of this order, the 
          importation into the United States of any article that is a 
          product of Burma is hereby prohibited.
          Sec. 4. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or 
          within the United States that evades or avoids, has the 
          purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of 
          the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
          (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions 
          set forth in this order is prohibited.
          Sec. 5. For purposes of this order:
          (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
          (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, 
          trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other 
          organization;
          (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
          citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the 
          laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the 
          United States (including foreign branches), or any person in 
          the United States; and

[[Page 243]]

          (d) the term ``Government of Burma'' means the Government of 
          Burma (sometimes referred to as Myanmar), its agencies, 
          instrumentalities and controlled entities, and the Central 
          Bank of Burma.
          Sec. 6. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the 
          type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 
          1702(b)(2)) by or to persons whose property and interests in 
          property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would 
          seriously impair my ability to deal with the national 
          emergency declared in Executive Order 13047, and hereby 
          prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of this 
          order.
          Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in 
          property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who 
          might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I 
          find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other 
          assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
          measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these 
          measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these 
          measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency 
          declared in Executive Order 13047, there need be no prior 
          notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this 
          order.
          Sec. 8. Determining that such a waiver is in the national 
          interest of the United States, I hereby waive the prohibitions 
          described in section 3 of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy 
          Act of 2003 with respect to any and all articles that are a 
          product of Burma to the extent that prohibiting the 
          importation of such articles would conflict with the 
          international obligations of the United States under the 
          Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the Vienna 
          Convention on Consular Relations, the United Nations 
          Headquarters Agreement, and other legal instruments providing 
          equivalent privileges and immunities.
          Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
          the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such 
          actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, 
          and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and 
          sections 3(a) and 4 of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act 
          of 2003, other than the authority to make the determinations 
          and certification to the Congress that Burma has met the 
          conditions described in 3(a)(3) of the Act, as may be 
          necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The 
          Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these 
          functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
          Government consistent with applicable law. The Secretary of 
          State is authorized to exercise the functions and authorities 
          conferred upon the President by section 3(b) of the Burmese 
          Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and to redelegate these 
          functions and authorities consistent with applicable law. All 
          agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed 
          to take all appropriate measures within their authority to 
          carry out the provisions of this order.
          Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
          the Secretary of State, is authorized to determine, subsequent 
          to the issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer 
          warrant inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and 
          that the property and interests in property of that person are 
          therefore no longer blocked pursuant to section 1 of this 
          order.
          Sec. 11. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the 
          continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, 
          licenses, or other forms of administrative action issued, 
          taken, or continued in effect heretofore or hereafter

[[Page 244]]

          under 31 C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly terminated, 
          modified, or suspended by or pursuant to this order.
          Sec. 12. Sections 1 through 7 of Executive Order 13047 are 
          hereby revoked to the extent they are inconsistent with this 
          order. All delegations, rules, regulations, orders, licenses, 
          and other forms of administrative action made, issued, or 
          otherwise taken under Executive Order 13047, not inconsistent 
          with section 3 of this order and not revoked administratively, 
          shall remain in full force and effect under this order until 
          amended, modified, or terminated by proper authority. The 
          revocation of any provision of Executive Order 13047 pursuant 
          to this section shall not affect any violation of any rules, 
          regulations, orders, licenses, or other forms of 
          administrative action under that order during the period that 
          such provision of that order was in effect.
          Sec. 13. All provisions of this order other than section 3 
          shall not apply to any activity, or any transaction incident 
          to an activity, undertaken pursuant to an agreement, or 
          pursuant to the exercise of rights under such an agreement, 
          that was entered into by a United States person with the 
          Government of Burma or a nongovernmental entity in Burma prior 
          to 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on May 21, 1997.
          Sec. 14. This order is not intended to, and does not, create 
          any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable 
          at law or in equity by any party against the United States, 
          its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its 
          officers or employees, or any other person.
          Sec. 15. This order is effective on 12:01 a.m. eastern 
          daylight time on July 29, 2003.
          Sec. 16. This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and 
          published in the Federal Register.

EO 13312

Executive Order 13312 of July 29, 2003

Implementing the Clean Diamond Trade Act

          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
          and the laws of the United States of America, including the 
          Clean Diamond Trade Act (Public Law 108	19) (the ``Act''), the 
          International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as amended (50 
          U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
          1601 et seq.), section 5 of the United Nations Participation 
          Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c), and section 301 of title 3, 
          United States Code, and in view of the national emergency 
          described and declared in Executive Order 13194 of January 18, 
          2001, and expanded in scope in Executive Order 13213 of May 
          22, 2001,
          I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, 
          note that, in response to the role played by the illicit trade 
          in diamonds in fueling conflict and human rights violations in 
          Sierra Leone, the President declared a national emergency in 
          Executive Order 13194 and imposed restrictions on the 
          importation of rough diamonds into the United States from 
          Sierra Leone. I expanded the scope of that emergency in 
          Executive Order 13213 and prohibited absolutely the 
          importation of rough diamonds from Liberia. I further note 
          that representatives of the United States and numerous other 
          countries announced in the Interlaken Declaration of November 
          5, 2002, the launch of the Kimberley Process Certification 
          Scheme (KPCS) for rough diamonds, under which Participants 
          prohibit the importation of rough diamonds from, or the 
          exportation of rough diamonds to, a non-Participant and 
          require that shipments of rough diamonds from or to a 
          Participant be controlled through the KPCS. The Clean Diamond 
          Trade Act authorizes the President to take steps to implement 
          the KPCS. Therefore, in order to implement the Act, to 
          harmonize Executive Orders 13194 and 13213 with the Act, to 
          address further threats to international peace and security 
          posed by the trade in conflict diamonds, and to avoid 
          undermining the legitimate diamond trade, it is hereby ordered 
          as follows:
          Section 1. Prohibitions. Notwithstanding the existence of any 
          rights or obligations conferred or imposed by any contract 
          entered into or any license or permit granted prior to July 
          30, 2003, the following are, except to the extent a waiver 
          issued under section 4(b) of the Act applies, prohibited:
          (a) the importation into, or exportation from, the United 
          States on or after July 30, 2003, of any rough diamond, from 
          whatever source, unless the rough diamond has been controlled 
          through the KPCS;
          (b) any transaction by a United States person anywhere, or any 
          transaction that occurs in whole or in part within the United 
          States, that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading 
          or avoiding, or attempts to violate, any of the prohibitions 
          set forth in this section; and

[[Page 247]]

          (c) any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions 
          of this section.
          Sec. 2. Assignment of Functions. (a) The functions of the 
          President under the Act are assigned as follows:
          (i) sections 4(b), 5(c), 6(b), 11, and 12 to the Secretary of 
          State; and
          (ii) sections 5(a) and 5(b) to the Secretary of the Treasury.
          (b) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury 
          may reassign any of these functions to other officers, 
          officials, departments, and agencies within the executive 
          branch, consistent with applicable law.
          (c) In performing the function of the President under section 
          11 of the Act, the Secretary of State shall establish the 
          coordinating committee as part of the Department of State for 
          administrative purposes only, and shall, consistent with 
          applicable law, provide administrative support to the 
          coordinating committee. In the performance of functions 
          assigned by subsection 2(a) of this order or by the Act, the 
          Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the 
          Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult the coordinating 
          committee, as appropriate.
          Sec. 3. Amendments to Related Executive Orders. (a) Section 1 
          of Executive Order 13194 of January 18, 2001, is revised to 
          read as follows:
          ``Section 1. Except to the extent provided by section 2 of 
          this order, and notwithstanding the existence of any rights or 
          obligations conferred or imposed by any contract entered into 
          or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date 
          of this order, the importation into, or exportation from, the 
          United States of any rough diamond from Sierra Leone, on or 
          after July 30, 2003, is prohibited.''
          (b) Section 2 of Executive Order 13194 is revised to read as 
          follows: ``Sec. 2. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order 
          shall not apply to the importation or exportation of any rough 
          diamond that has been controlled through the Kimberley Process 
          Certification Scheme.''
          (c) Sections 4(c), (d), and (e) of Executive Order 13194 are 
          deleted, and the word ``and'' is added after the semicolon at 
          the end of section 4(a).
          (d) Section 1 of Executive Order 13213 of May 22, 2001, is 
          revised to read as follows: ``Section 1. Notwithstanding the 
          existence of any rights or obligations conferred or imposed by 
          any contract entered into or any license or permit granted 
          prior to the effective date of this order, the direct or 
          indirect importation into the United States of all rough 
          diamonds from Liberia, whether or not such diamonds originated 
          in Liberia, on or after July 30, 2003, is prohibited.''
          Sec. 4. Definitions. For the purposes of this order and 
          Executive Order 13194, the definitions set forth in section 3 
          of the Act shall apply, and the term ``Kimberley Process 
          Certification Scheme'' shall not be construed to include any 
          changes to the KPCS after April 25, 2003.
          Sec. 5. General Provisions. This order is not intended to, and 
          does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or 
          procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party 
          against the United States, its departments, agencies, 
          instrumentalities or entities, its officers or employees, or 
          any other person.

          time on July 30, 2003. The remaining provisions of this order

Blocking Property of the Former Iraqi Regime, Its Senior Officials and 
Their Family Members, and Taking Certain Other Actions

          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
          and the laws of the United States of America, including the 
          International Emergency

[[Page 253]]

          Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
          National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 5 
          of the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
          287c) (UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, 
          in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 of 
          May 22, 2003, and in order to take additional steps with 
          respect to the situation in Iraq,
          I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, 
          hereby expand the scope of the national emergency declared in 
          Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003, to address the unusual 
          and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
          policy of the United States posed by obstacles to the orderly 
          reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of 
          peace and security in that country, and the development of 
          political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. 
          I find that the removal of Iraqi property from that country by 
          certain senior officials of the former Iraqi regime and their 
          immediate family members constitutes one of these obstacles. I 
          further determine that the United States is engaged in armed 
          hostilities and that it is in the interest of the United 
          States to confiscate certain additional property of the former 
          Iraqi regime, certain senior officials of the former regime, 
          immediate family members of those officials, and controlled 
          entities. I intend that such property, after all right, title, 
          and interest in it has vested in the Department of the 
          Treasury, shall be transferred to the Development Fund for 
          Iraq. Such property shall be used to meet the humanitarian 
          needs of the Iraqi people, for the economic reconstruction and 
          repair of Iraq's infrastructure, for the continued disarmament 
          of Iraq, for the costs of Iraqi civilian administration, and 
          for other purposes benefiting the Iraqi people. I determine 
          that such use would be in the interest of and for the benefit 
          of the United States. I hereby order:
          Section 1. Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), 
          (3), and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), or 
          regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be 
          issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any 
          contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior 
          to the effective date of this order, all property and 
          interests in property of the former Iraqi regime or its state 
          bodies, corporations, or agencies, or of the following 
          persons, that are in the United States, that hereafter come 
          within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within 
          the possession or control of United States persons, are 
          blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, 
          or otherwise dealt in:
          (a) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
          (b) persons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
          consultation with the Secretary of State,

   (i) to be senior officials of the former Iraqi regime or their immediate 
family members; or

   (ii) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or 
on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any of the persons listed in the 
Annex to this order or determined to be subject to this order.

          Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
          the Secretary of State, is authorized to confiscate property 
          that is blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order and that 
          he determines, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to 
          belong to a person, organization, or country that has planned, 
          authorized, aided, or engaged in armed hostilities against the 
          United States. All right, title, and interest in any property 
          so confiscated

[[Page 254]]

          shall vest in the Department of the Treasury. Such vested 
          property shall promptly be transferred to the Development Fund 
          for Iraq.
          Sec. 3. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or 
          within the United States that evades or avoids, has the 
          purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of 
          the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
          (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions 
          set forth in this order is prohibited.
          Sec. 4. For purposes of this order:
          (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
          (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, 
          trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other 
          organization;
          (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
          citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the 
          laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the 
          United States (including foreign branches), or any person in 
          the United States;
          (d) the term ``former Iraqi regime'' means the Saddam Hussein 
          regime that governed Iraq until on or about May 1, 2003;
          (e) the term ``coalition authority'' means the Coalition 
          Provisional Authority under the direction of its 
          Administrator, and the military forces of the United States, 
          the United Kingdom, and their coalition partners present in 
          Iraq under the command or operational control of the Commander 
          of United States Central Command; and
          (f) the term ``Development Fund for Iraq'' means the fund 
          established on or about May 22, 2003, on the books of the 
          Central Bank of Iraq, by the Administrator of the Coalition 
          Provisional Authority responsible for the temporary governance 
          of Iraq and all accounts held for the fund or for the Central 
          Bank of Iraq in the name of the fund.
          Sec. 5. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the 
          type specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 
          1702(b)(2)) by or to persons determined to be subject to the 
          sanctions imposed under this order would seriously impair my 
          ability to deal with the national emergency declared in 
          Executive Order 13303 and expanded in scope in this order and 
          would endanger Armed Forces of the United States that are 
          engaged in hostilities, and I hereby prohibit such donations 
          as provided by section 1 of this order.
          Sec. 6. For those persons listed in the Annex to this order or 
          determined to be subject to this order who might have a 
          constitutional presence in the United States, I find that 
          because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets 
          instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to 
          be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures 
          ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to 
          be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in 
          Executive Order 13303 and expanded in scope in this order, 
          there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination 
          made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
          Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
          the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such 
          actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, 
          and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and 
          UNPA as may be necessary to carry out the purposes

[[Page 255]]

          of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate 
          any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the 
          United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All 
          agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed 
          to take all appropriate measures within their authority to 
          carry out the provisions of this order.
          Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
          the Secretary of State, is authorized to determine, subsequent 
          to the issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer 
          warrant inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and 
          that such person is therefore no longer covered within the 
          scope of the order.
          Sec. 9. Nothing in this order is intended to affect the 
          continued effectiveness of any rules, regulations, orders, 
          licenses, or other forms of administrative action issued, 
          taken, or continued in effect heretofore or hereafter under 31 
          C.F.R. chapter V, except as expressly terminated, modified, or 
          suspended by or pursuant to this order.
          Sec. 10. This order shall not apply to such property as is or 
          may come under the control of the coalition authority in Iraq. 
          Nothing in this order is intended to affect dispositions of 
          such property or other determinations by the coalition 
          authority.
          Sec. 11. This order is not intended to, and does not, create 
          any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable 
          at law or in equity by any party against the United States, 
          its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, 
          officers or employees, or any other person.
          Sec. 12. This order is effective on 12:01 a.m. EDT on August 
          29, 2003.
          Sec. 13. This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and 
          published in the Federal Register.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

EO 13317

Executive Order 13317 of September 25, 2003

Volunteers for Prosperity

          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
          and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to 
          encourage volunteer service by highly skilled Americans to 
          support major initiatives by the United States for promoting 
          health and prosperity around the world, it is hereby ordered 
          as follows:
          Section 1. (a) Policy. A part of USA Freedom Corps, 
          ``Volunteers for Prosperity'' is a call to service to support 
          major U.S. initiatives that promote health and prosperity 
          around the world. Deploying highly skilled volunteers abroad 
          is an efficient way to use our resources consistent with the 
          objectives of the United States Government's global prosperity 
          agenda. United States volunteers will help to achieve the 
          objectives of the global prosperity agenda, including 
          providing clean water to the poor, promoting democratic 
          governance, developing economic freedom, promoting free and 
          open markets, and stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS.
          The investment of Federal resources to enable U.S. volunteers 
          to work with nongovernmental and voluntary service 
          organizations overseas is a preferred use of our resources and 
          also will help leverage private sector resources. United 
          States citizens who are skilled professionals and who 
          volunteer, when matched with organizations working on specific 
          U.S. prosperity initiatives overseas, can provide invaluable 
          support for these initiatives and will supplement and 
          complement the traditions and accomplishments of the Peace 
          Corps.
          United States prosperity initiatives that can benefit from 
          volunteer service include, but are not limited to, the 
          Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Digital Freedom 
          Initiative, the Water for the Poor Initiative, the Trade for 
          African Development and Enterprise Initiative, and the Middle 
          East Partnership Initiative.
          Volunteer service in support of other initiatives, consistent 
          with U.S. foreign policy, shall be considered as well.
          (b) Applicability. The following agencies are subject to the 
          requirements of this order: the United States Agency for 
          International Development (USAID), the Department of State, 
          the Department of Commerce, the Department of Health and Human 
          Services, and such other Federal agencies as the President may 
          designate in the future.
          Sec. 2. Establishment. (a) Agencies subject to this order 
          shall each establish within their respective organizations an 
          Office for Volunteers for Prosperity (Office) or, as 
          appropriate, an operating unit within an office.

[[Page 264]]

          (b) Each agency subject to this order shall provide its Office 
          or unit with appropriate staff, administrative support, and 
          resources to meet its responsibilities under this order.
          (c) Each of these Offices or units shall begin operations no 
          later than 30 days from the date of this order.
          (d) Agencies subject to this order shall consider, in 
          evaluating grant applications for assistance activities to be

          voluntary service organizations around the world in support of 
          major U.S. prosperity initiatives as identified in section 1 
          of this order. Such promotion, expansion, and enhancement 
          would include actively participating in the design and 
          selection processes for grants within their agencies, tracking 
          the use of U.S. private volunteer organizations by their 
          agencies, and coordinating with White House Offices including

          highly skilled U.S. volunteers to accomplish the objectives 
          identified in those initiatives.
          Sec. 5. Coordination. The USAID shall serve as the inter-
          agency coordinator for the Volunteers for Prosperity 
          initiative. In that capacity, the USAID shall coordinate the 
          activities that fall within the scope of the initiative and 
          report on the progress of the initiative to the USA Freedom 
          Corps Office, within the White House Office. The reports shall 
          be submitted within 180 days after the date of this order and 
          annually thereafter. The USA Freedom Corps Council shall 
          encourage consistency in policies and practices within the 
          agencies subject to this order, as appropriate, for purposes 
          related to the Volunteers for Prosperity initiative.
          Sec. 6. Administration. The actions directed by this order 
          shall be carried out subject to the availability of 
          appropriations, to the extent permitted by law, and consistent

          Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to 
          improve the internal management of the executive branch of the 
          Federal Government, and it is not intended to, and does not,

          enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, 
          its departments, agencies, or other entities, its officers or 
          employees, or any other person.

Presidential Management Fellows Program

          By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution 
          and the laws of the United States of America, including 
          sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and in 
          order to provide for the recruitment and selection of 
          outstanding employees for service in public sector management, 
          it is hereby ordered as follows:
          Section 1. There is hereby constituted the Presidential 
          Management Fellows Program. The purpose of the Program is to 
          attract to the Federal service outstanding men and women from 
          a variety of academic disciplines and career paths who have a 
          clear interest in, and commitment to, excellence in the 
          leadership and management of public policies and programs. 
          Individuals selected for the Program shall be known as 
          Presidential Management Fellows (PMFs) or Senior Presidential 
          Management Fellows (Senior PMFs).
          Sec. 2. (a) Individuals eligible for appointment as a PMF 
          under this order are those who, in pursuing a course of study 
          at the graduate level, have demonstrated both exceptional 
          ability and the commitment to which section 1 refers. Such 
          individuals at the time of application must have received, or 
          must expect to receive soon thereafter, an appropriate 
          advanced degree as defined by the Director of the Office of 
          Personnel Management (OPM).
          (b) Individuals eligible for appointment as a Senior PMF under 
          this order are those who have, through extensive work 
          experience, demonstrated both exceptional leadership or 
          analytical ability and the commitment to which section 1 
          refers.
          Sec. 3. The Director of OPM shall prescribe appropriate merit-
          based rules for the recruitment, nomination, assessment, 
          selection, appointment, placement, and continuing career 
          development of fellows, including rules that:
          (a) reserve to the head of a department or agency or component 
          within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) the 
          authority to appoint a fellow who is to be employed in that 
          department, agency, or component;
          (b) provide for nomination by universities and colleges, 
          through competitive selection processes, of eligible 
          individuals for consideration for appointment as PMFs;
          (c) carry out the policy of the United States to ensure equal 
          employment opportunities for employees without discrimination 
          because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; and
          (d) ensure the application of appropriate veterans' preference 
          criteria.
          Sec. 4. (a) Fellows shall be appointed to positions in either:
          (1) Schedule A of the excepted service; or
          (2) an agency or component within the EOP excepted from the 
          competitive service.
          (b) Appointments under subsection (a) shall not exceed 2 years 
          in duration unless extended by the head of the department or 
          agency or component within the EOP, with the concurrence of 
          the Director of OPM, for a period not to exceed 1 additional 
          year.

[[Page 266]]

          (c) The following principles and policies shall govern service 
          and tenure by fellows:
          (1) responsibilities assigned to a PMF shall be consistent 
          with the PMF's educational background and career interests, 
          and the purposes of the Program; and responsibilities assigned 
          to a Senior PMF shall be consistent with the Senior PMF's 
          experience and career interests, and the purposes of the 
          Program;
          (2) continuation of a fellow's appointment shall be contingent 
          upon satisfactory performance by the fellow throughout the 
          fellowship appointment;
          (3) except as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, 
          service as a fellow shall confer no right to further Federal 
          employment in either the competitive or excepted service upon 
          the expiration of the fellow's appointment; and
          (4) competitive civil service status may be granted to a 
          fellow who satisfactorily completes the Program and meets such 
          other requirements as the Director of OPM may prescribe. A 
          fellow appointed by an agency excepted from the competitive 
          service may also be appointed to a permanent position in an 
          excepted service agency without further competition.
          Sec. 5. The Director of OPM shall provide for an orderly 
          transition, including with respect to nominations, selection 
          processes, and appointments, from the Presidential Management 
          Intern Program established by Executive Order 12364 of May 24, 
          1982, to the Presidential Management Fellows Program 
          established by this order. Until that transition is provided 
          for, individuals who were selected or appointed under the 
          provisions of Executive Order 12364 and who have not completed 
          their scheduled periods of excepted service are hereby 
          redesignated as Presidential Management Fellows, and continue 
          their internships under the terms of Executive Order 12364.
          Sec. 6. The Director of OPM shall prescribe such regulations 
          as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order.
          Sec. 7. Executive Order 12364 is superseded, except as 
          provided in section 5 of this order.
          Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create 
          any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable 
          at law or in equity by any party against the United States, 
          its departments, agencies, instrumentalities or entities, its 
          officers or employees, or any other person.

Notice of January 2, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya

          On January 7, 1986, by Executive Order 12543, President Reagan 
          declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and 
          extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
          policy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
          policies of the Government of Libya. On January 8, 1986, by 
          Executive Order 12544, the President took additional measures 
          to block Libyan assets in the United States. The President has 
          transmitted a notice continuing this emergency to the Congress 
          and the Federal Register every year since 1986.
          The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the 
          declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has 
          not been resolved. Despite the United Nations Security 
          Council's suspension of U.N. sanctions against Libya upon the 
          Libyan government's hand-over of the Pan Am 103 bombing 
          suspects, Libya has not yet complied with its obligations 
          under U.N. Security Council Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 
          (1992), and 883 (1993), which include Libya's obligation to 
          accept respon sibility for the actions of its officials and

          Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National

Notice of January 16, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect To

Sierra Leone and Liberia

          On January 18, 2001, by Executive Order 13194, the President 
          declared a national emergency with respect to Sierra Leone 
          pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
          (50 U.S.C. 1701	1706) to deal with the unusual and 
          extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
          States constituted by the actions and policies of the 
          insurgent Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone and 
          pursuant to which the United States imposed a general ban on 
          the direct and indirect importation of all rough diamonds from 
          Sierra Leone into the United States, except those imports 
          controlled through the Certificate of Origin regime of the 
          Government of Sierra Leone. On May 22, 2001, I issued 
          Executive Order 13213, which expanded the scope of the 
          national emergency to include actions of the Government of 
          Liberia in support of the RUF and prohibited the importation 
          of all rough diamonds from Liberia.
          Because the actions and policies of the RUF continue to pose 
          an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of 
          the United States, the national emergency declared on January 
          18, 2001, as expanded on May 22,

[[Page 289]]

          2001, and the measures adopted on those dates to deal with 
          that emergency must continue in effect beyond January 18, 
          2003. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
          National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing 
          for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Sierra Leone 
          and Liberia.
          This Notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
          transmitted to the Congress.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

Memorandum of January 17, 2003

Presidential Determination on Pedestal Actuator Imports from the People's 
Republic of China

Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative

          Pursuant to section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
          (19 U.S.C. 2451), I have determined the action I will take 
          with respect to the affirmative determination of the United 
          States International Trade Commission (USITC) regarding 
          imports of pedestal actuators from China. The USITC, on the 
          basis of its investigation (No. TA	421	1), determined that 
          pedestal actuators from China are being imported into the 
          United States in such increased quantities or under such 
          conditions as to cause market disruption to the domestic 
          producers of like or directly competitive products.
          After considering all relevant aspects of the investigation, I 
          have determined that providing import relief for the U.S. 
          pedestal actuator industry is not in the national economic 
          interest of the United States. In particular, I find that the 
          import relief would have an adverse impact on the United 
          States economy clearly greater than the benefits of such 
          action.
          In determining not to provide import relief, I considered its 
          overall costs to the U.S. economy. The facts of this case 
          indicate that imposing the USITC's recommended quota would not 
          likely benefit the domestic producing industry and instead 
          would cause imports to shift from China to other offshore 
          sources.
          Even if the quota were to benefit the primary domestic 
          producer, the cost of the quota to consumers, both the 
          downstream purchasing industry and users of the downstream 
          products, would substantially outweigh any benefit to 
          producers' income. The USITC's analysis confirms this 
          conclusion.
          In addition, downstream industries are already under pressure 
          to migrate production offshore to compete with lower-cost 
          imports of finished products. Higher component costs resulting 
          from import relief would add to this pressure. Given the 
          significantly larger number of workers in the downstream 
          purchasing industry when compared with the domestic pedestal 
          actuator industry, I find that imposing import restrictions 
          would do more economic harm than good.

[[Page 290]]

          Finally, a quota would negatively affect the many disabled and 
          elderly purchasers of mobility scooters and electric 
          wheelchairs, the primary ultimate consumers of pedestal 
          actuators.
          You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in 
          the Federal Register.

Notice of January 20, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to

Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

          On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President 
          declared a national emergency pursuant to the International 
          Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701	1706) to deal 
          with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
          security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
          constituted by grave acts of violence committed by foreign 
          terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace 
          process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
          President identified four additional persons, including Usama 
          bin Ladin, who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace 
          process.
          Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the 
          Middle East peace process and continue to pose an unusual and 
          extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, 
          and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
          declared on January 23, 1995, as expanded on August 20, 1998, 
          and the measures adopted on those dates to deal with that 
          emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2003. 
          Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
          Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
          year the national emergency with respect to foreign terrorists 
          who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.
          This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
          transmitted to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 2003-13 of January 29, 2003

Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and 
Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          Pursuant to section (2)(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee 
          Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I 
          hereby determine that it is important to the national interest 
          that up to $15 million be made available from the U.S. 
          Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to meet 
          unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs that would be 
          anticipated in the event of a future humanitarian emergency in 
          the Middle East, to include contingency planning for such 
          needs. Such an emergency may arise if it becomes necessary for 
          the United States and other nations to use military force to 
          disarm the Iraqi regime of its weapons of mass destruction. 
          These funds may be used, as appropriate, to provide 
          contributions to international, governmental, and 
          nongovernmental organizations, as well as for administrative 
          expenses to manage contingency planning by the Department of

          You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate 
          committees of the Congress of this determination and the 
          obligation of funds under this authority, and to arrange for

Presidential Determination No. 2003-14 of January 30, 2003

Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug 
Producing Countries for 2003

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations 
          Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107	228) 
          (FRAA), which was enacted on September 30, 2002, I hereby 
          identify the following countries as major drug transit or 
          major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The 
          Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, China, Colombia, Dominican 
          Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, 
          Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, 
          Venezuela, and Vietnam.
          The Majors List applies by its terms to countries. The United 
          States Government interprets the term broadly to include 
          entities that exercise autonomy over actions or omissions that 
          could lead to a decision to place them on the list and, 
          subsequently, to determine their eligibility for 
          certification. A country's presence on the Majors List is not 
          necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's 
          counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the 
          United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a 
          major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in 
          section 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
          amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or 
          drug producing countries are placed on the list is the 
          combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors 
          that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the 
          concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.
          Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate 
          Burma, Guatemala, and Haiti as countries that have failed 
          demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their 
          obligations under international counternarcotics agreements 
          and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the 
          FAA. Attached to this memorandum are justifications for each 
          of the countries so designated, as required by section 
          706(2)(B).
          I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of 
          section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that provision of United States 
          assistance to Guatemala and Haiti in FY 2003 is vital to the 
          national interests of the United States.
          Additionally, the alarming increase in the quantity of illegal 
          synthetic drugs entering the United States, especially ecstasy 
          from Europe, is of particular concern. A significant amount of 
          the ecstasy consumed in the United States is manufactured 
          clandestinely in The Netherlands (in 2001, a total of 9.5 
          million ecstasy tablets were seized in the United States, and 
          the Drug Enforcement Administration believes that the majority 
          of tablets originated in The Netherlands). We are working 
          closely with Dutch authorities to stop the production and 
          export of ecstasy, which we both regard as a serious threat to 
          our citizens. We expect Dutch authorities to move effectively 
          and measurably in the coming year against the production and 
          export of this drug, including dismantling labs and proceeding 
          against trafficking organizations. Early in the year, we plan 
          to discuss specific steps we can take together to reduce drug 
          trafficking.
          Although the United States enjoys an excellent level of 
          bilateral cooperation with Canada, the United States 
          Government is concerned that Canada

[[Page 294]]

          is a primary source of pseudoephedrine and an increasing 
          source of high potency marijuana, which are exported to the 
          United States. Over the past few years there has been an 
          alarming increase in the amount of pseudoephedrine diverted 
          from Canadian sources to clandestine drug laboratories in the 
          United States, where it is used to make methamphetamine. The 
          Government of Canada, for the most part, has not regulated the 
          sale and distribution of precursor chemicals. The regulations 
          to restrict the availability of pseudoephedrine, which the 
          Government of Canada has just promulgated, should be stronger. 
          Notwithstanding Canada's inadequate control of illicit 
          diversion of precursor chemicals, I commend Canadian law 
          enforcement agencies, which continue to work energetically to 
          support our joint law enforcement efforts.
          Under section 706 of the FRAA, you are hereby authorized and 
          directed to submit this memorandum to the Congress, and to 
          publish it in the Federal Register.

GEORGE W. BUSH

THE WHITE HOUSE,

Washington, January 30, 2003.

Statement of Explanation

Burma

          The United States has determined that Burma failed 
          demonstrably to make sufficient efforts during the last 12 
          months to meet its obligations under international 
          counternarcotics agreements and the counternarcotics 
          requirements set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the Foreign 
          Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.
          Burma remains the world's number one producer and trafficker 
          of methamphetamine and the world's second largest producer and 
          trafficker of heroin. Judging from the situation in 
          neighboring countries, production and trafficking of 
          methamphetamine from Burma continues to be one of the most 
          serious problems facing Southeast Asia. Drug gangs operate 
          freely within Burma along its borders with China and Thailand, 
          producing several hundred million methamphetamine tablets 
          annually by using precursors imported from neighboring states.
          Although Burma banned the import, sale, and use of 25 
          precursor chemicals and related substances used in the 
          production of methamphetamine in 2002, Burma has yet to take 
          effective measures against methamphetamine production and 
          trafficking or the importation of precursor chemicals from 
          neighboring states used in the production of methamphetamine. 
          Hundreds of millions of methamphetamine tablets flooded the 
          region, and seizures of methamphetamine went down 
          significantly in 2002 (about 9 million tablets compared to 32 
          million in 2001), representing only a tiny fraction of the 
          estimated production. In addition, the government destroyed a 
          smaller number of methamphetamine and heroin labs in 2002 
          compared to the previous year.

[[Page 295]]

          Burma has also yet to curb involvement in illicit narcotics by 
          the largest, most powerful, and most important trafficking 
          organization within its borders, the United Wa State Army 
          (UWSA). Although the government claims it has increased 
          pressure on the UWSA to end opium production, major UWSA 
          traffickers continue to operate with apparent impunity and 
          UWSA involvement in methamphetamine production and trafficking 
          remains a serious concern.
          While the United States gives Burma a failing grade due to the 
          magnitude of the above issues, we do note some progress on 
          several counternarcotics fronts. Although Burma remains the 
          world's second largest producer of illicit opium, opium 
          production in Burma declined 26 percent in the past year, 
          seizures of heroin and opium increased, and the government has 
          initiated several cases against accused money-launders under 
          new anti-money laundering laws.
          The Government of Burma (GOB) also continued to cooperate with 
          regional and international counternarcotics agencies and 
          organizations, resulting in several cases against traffickers 
          and their organizations in cooperation with the United States, 
          Australia, Thailand, China, and others. Increased cooperation 
          with China, in particular, resulted in the rendering of 
          several narco-traffickers to China in 2002.
          We urge the GOB to redouble efforts in those areas where it is 
          making progress and to address those major gaps where it has 
          made no serious efforts to date.

Guatemala

          Despite improvements towards the end of the year, Guatemala 
          failed demonstrably during the last 12 months to make 
          substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under 
          international counternarcotics agreements and to take the 
          counternarcotics measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of 
          the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. Guatemala 
          remains a major transshipment point for drugs, primarily 
          cocaine, moving from South America to the United States. 
          However, the vital national interests of the United States 
          require the United States to continue providing assistance to 
          Guatemala under the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and 
          Related Programs Act, 2002 (P.L. 107	115).
          During 2002, Guatemala's overall counterdrug commitment 
          deteriorated. The Government of Guatemala's (GOG) 
          counternarcotics efforts traditionally have been limited by a 
          lack of resources for police, prosecutors, and judges. 
          However, in 2002, a heightened level of corruption also 
          impeded significant progress in the battle against 
          narcotrafficking. Seizures of illegal narcotics and narcotics-
          related prosecutions in Guatemala were dramatically lower than 
          in years past, despite evidence that the flow of illegal drugs 
          had not diminished. Efforts to pass and implement anti-
          corruption and transparency legislation floundered. Few high-
          level figures were formally investigated or indicted, and the 
          Anti-Narcotics Police was disbanded after several attempts at 
          reform and the firing or reassignment of 75% of all personnel. 
          The majority of Anti-Narcotics Prosecutors were also removed 
          or transferred in the last year due to poor performance. 
          During

[[Page 296]]

          2002, police stole an amount of drugs estimated at double the 
          amount officially seized, and were identified as responsible 
          for drug-related extra-judicial executions of both 
          narcotraffickers and civilians.
          Toward the end of 2002, at the request of the United States 
          the GOG took some positive counternarcotics steps. The GOG 
          promulgated regulations to implement the modern money 
          laundering legislation passed in 2001 (though there have been 
          no convictions to date). A number of police officers were 
          arrested and others removed from office in connection with a 
          gun battle over a drug shipment in the town of Chocon. The GOG 
          recently began regularly destroying newly confiscated drugs 
          not needed for evidence, and, in December, destroyed a modest 
          amount of drugs stored from older cases.
          Despite Guatemala's demonstrable failure on counternarcotics 
          efforts, U.S. vital national interests require that U.S. 
          assistance to Guatemala continue. Social and political 
          problems underlying the country's 36-year civil conflict 
          remain, and many Peace Accord commitments have not been met. 
          There is a need for continued assistance to programs that 
          diversify the rural economy, increase access to education and 
          medical services, strengthen judicial and human rights 
          institutions, foster the development of civil society, and 
          address environmental concerns. These programs create an 
          environment conducive to building democracy and reducing 
          illegal migration. They also address social injustice, 
          poverty, and distrust of civil authority in Guatemala, which 
          are contributing factors behind Guatemalan involvement in the 
          drug trade. The upcoming Central American Free Trade Agreement 
          negotiations will also require significant U.S. involvement 
          and assistance in projects linked to further economic 
          liberalization. Additionally, suspension of assistance to 
          Guatemala would result in the further deterioration of 
          Guatemalan institutions essential to combating the ever-
          growing influence of organized crime in Guatemala.

Haiti

          Haiti failed demonstrably during the last 12 months to make 
          substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under 
          international counternarcotics agreements and take the 
          counternarcotics measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of 
          the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. Haiti remains 
          a significant transshipment point for drugs, primarily 
          cocaine, moving through the Caribbean from South America to 
          the United States. However, the vital national interests of 
          the United States require the United States to continue to 
          provide assistance to Haiti under the Foreign Operations, 
          Export, Financing, and Related Programs Act, 2002 (P.L. 107	
          115) Haiti's overall counterdrug commitment has remained weak, 
          in part due to political instability and low levels of 
          assistance. Such instability, coupled with economic 
          degradation, has led to an increase in criminal and political 
          violence and compromised internal security. Corruption is 
          rife; including reported police involvement in kidnapping-for-
          ransom, car theft, and coercion of junior police officers 
          either to assist in or to ignore drug trafficking activities. 
          President Aristide has attempted to shore up his personal and 
          political security by politicizing the Haitian National Police 
          (HNP). This, in contravention to one of President Aristide's 
          commitments to the United States Government, bodes ill for an 
          effective counternarcotics effort.

[[Page 297]]

          With two exceptions (putting into force a 1997 U.S.-Haiti 
          bilateral maritime counternarcotics interdiction agreement and 
          establishing a Financial Intelligence Unit), the Government of 
          Haiti (GOH) has taken no action on its own initiative in the 
          past year either to cooperate with the United States to 
          interdict the flow of drugs destined for the United States or 
          to honor its commitments as a party to the 1988 U.N. Drug 
          Convention.
          Other than signing a bilateral counternarcotics Letter of 
          Agreement, permitting the polygraph examination of 40 HNP 
          anti-drug unit officers, and removing those with questionable 
          results, Haiti failed to take significant counterdrug actions 
          requested by the United States Government. In summary, the GOH 
          did not:
          1) Deposit an instrument of ratification of the OAS Inter-
          American Convention Against Corruption;
          2) introduce anti-corruption legislation;
          3) prosecute drug-related public (including police) 
          corruption;
          4) implement fully the anti-money laundering law passed in 
          January 2001;
          5) enforce existing anti-money laundering guidelines issued by 
          the Central Bank;
          6) require cross-border currency declarations and provide 
          penalties for noncompliance;
          7) increase the number of arrests of major traffickers;
          8) establish a permanent BLTS (French acronym for the HNP 
          anti-drug unit) office outside Port-au-Prince; or
          9) provide training to judges, prosecutors, and law 
          enforcement officials.
          Despite Haiti's demonstrable failure on counternarcotics 
          issues, U.S. vital national interests require that U.S. 
          assistance to Haiti continue. Haiti is the hemisphere's 
          poorest country. There is a continued need for assistance to 
          programs that increase access to education, combat 
          environmental degradation, fight the spread of HIV/AIDS, and 
          foster the creation of legitimate business and employment 
          opportunities. These programs can create an atmosphere 
          conducive to building democracy and reducing illegal 
          migration. They will also address root causes of poverty and 
          hopelessness in Haiti, contributing factors behind Haitian 
          involvement in the international drug trade. Suspension of 
          assistance to Haiti would result in the further deterioration 
          of Haitian institutions. Additionally, suspension would hamper 
          U.S. efforts to ensure implementation of OAS Resolution 822, 
          which commits Haiti to hold legislative elections in 2003.

Notice of February 27, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

          On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, President Clinton 
          declared a national emergency to address the disturbance or 
          threatened disturbance of international relations caused by 
          the February 24, 1996, destruction by the Government of Cuba 
          of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
          international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on 
          subsequent occasions, the Government of Cuba stated its intent 
          to forcefully defend its sovereignty against any U.S.-
          registered vessels or aircraft that might enter Cuban 
          territorial waters or airspace while involved in a flotilla 
          and peaceful protest. Since these events, the Government of 
          Cuba has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the future 
          use of reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or 
          aircraft that may engage in memorial activities or peaceful 
          protest north of Cuba. Therefore, in accordance with section 
          202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I 
          am continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and 
          the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the 
          anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 
          6867.

Implementation of Section 3107 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment 
Act of 2002, Relating to Food for Education and Child Nutrition

Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture

          Effective upon the publication of this memorandum in the 
          Federal Register, there is established the program relating to 
          food for education and child nutrition authorized by 
          subsection 3107(b) of the Farm Security and Rural Investment 
          Act of 2002 (Public Law 107	171) (7 U.S.C. 17360	1). Pursuant 
          to subsection 3107(d) of the Act, the Department of

Notice of March 12, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

          On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President 
          declared a national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to 
          the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
          1701	1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat 
          to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
          United States constituted by the actions and policies of the 
          Government of Iran, including its support for international 
          terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, 
          and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means 
          to deliver them. On May 6, 1995, the President issued 
          Executive Order 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to 
          further respond to this threat, and on August 19, 1997, the 
          President issued Executive Order 13059 consolidating and 
          clarifying the previous orders.
          Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran 
          continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
          national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
          States, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, 
          must continue in effect beyond March 15, 2003. Therefore, in 
          accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act 
          (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
          emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
          by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate 
          from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 
          12170, this renewal is distinct from the emergency renewal of 
          November 2002. This notice shall be published in the Federal 
          Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 2003-17 of March 20, 2003

Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Act of 1962, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          Pursuant to section (2)(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee 
          Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I 
          hereby determine that it is important to the national interest 
          that up to $22 million be made available from the U.S. 
          Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to meet 
          unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs that are 
          anticipated in the event of a future humanitarian emergency in 
          the Middle East, to include contingency planning for such 
          needs. Such an emergency may arise if it becomes necessary for 
          the United States and other nations to use military force to 
          disarm the Iraqi regime of its weapons of mass destruction.

Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward Burma For the Period September 
28, 2002--March 27, 2003

Introduction and Summary

          Efforts to foster peaceful democratic change in Burma 
          essentially ground to a halt over the past six months. The 
          regime has become more confrontational in its exchanges with 
          the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu 
          Kyi, and has offered few signs of progress toward their stated 
          commitment to a political transition to democracy and not 
          interest in pursuing political dialogue with the elected 
          opposition. UN

          Special Envoy Razali continued his mission, the National 
          League for Democracy opened up a significant number of 
          township and divisional party offices, and NLD General 
          Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi was able to continue her travels in 
          Burma, visiting both Shan and Rakhine States. However, the 
          visit to Rakhine State was marred by incidents instigated by 
          government-affiliated organizations and believed to be based 
          on orders from Rangoon; political prisoner releases stopped as 
          of late November, and there were new arrests of political 
          activists. Aung San Suu Kyi was nearly jailed in February on 
          charges arising from a civil lawsuit filed by a relative. Most 
          seriously, the regime has not demonstrated its willingness to 
          begin a real dialogue with the NLD on substantive political 
          issues.
          Economic developments were punctuated by the banking crisis 
          that followed the collapse of approximately 20 informal 
          financial institutions, which had taken deposits in return for 
          promises of returns of five percent per month or more. 
          Stimulated by the rampant inflation in recent years, and the 
          repressed financial conditions that had stifled the growth of 
          legitimate financial institutions, these informal financial 
          institutions had grown rapidly for two years, before 
          collapsing in January, sparking a run on the private banks. 
          The banks have coped by restricting withdrawals, calling in 
          loans, and requesting emergency central bank support. Several 
          may nonetheless fail. Only private banks have been affected 
          thus far. All of the government-owned banks and all of the 
          banks in which government corporations participate as joint 
          venture partners have continued to run normally. Inflation has 
          also come down sharply as the asset price inflation fueled by 
          the activities of the informal financial institutions has 
          collapsed.
          The Government of Burma (GOB) severely abuses the human rights 
          of its citizens. There is no real freedom of speech, press, 
          assembly, association, or travel. Burmese citizens are not 
          free to change their government. Religious minorities 
          (particularly Christians and Muslims) are discriminated 
          against and any form of proselytizing is discouraged. Security 
          forces also regularly monitor citizens' movements and 
          communications, search homes without warrants, and relocate 
          persons forcibly without just compensation or legal recourse. 
          In June 2002, the Shan Human Rights Foundation (SHRF) accused 
          the Burma Army of using rape systematically as ``a weapon of 
          war'' in ethnic minority areas along the Thai border. The 
          regime denied those charges and has not agreed with UN Special 
          Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma Paulo Sergio Pinheiro on 
          the ways and means for an effective, impartial international 
          investigation of these allegations. However, the government 
          did recently intervene and punish both an army officer found 
          guilty of rape and his commanding officers. Forced labor also 
          remained an issue of serious international concern, despite 
          some limited government efforts to control the practice. An 
          International Labor Organization (ILO) Liaison Officer was 
          appointed to Burma in October 2002 and, at the direction of 
          the ILO Governing Body, has attempted to hammer out a ``viable 
          program of action'' with the government to eliminate forced 
          labor. Thus far, those efforts have not achieved the stated 
          objective.
          Burma remains one of the world's largest producers of opium, 
          heroin, and amphetamine-type stimulants. Its overall output of 
          opium and heroin has declined for six straight years; in 2002 
          Burma produced less than one-quarter of the opium and heroin 
          than it did six years before. At the same time, however, the 
          production of methamphetamines has soared, particularly in the 
          area controlled by the Wa ethnic group. According to some 
          estimates,

[[Page 306]]

          as many as 400 million to 800 million methamphetamine tablets 
          may be produced in Burma each year, although these estimates 
          are difficult to verify. Burma has joined with China, 
          Thailand, and India in attempting to curb this traffic; as 
          yet, however, there are few signs that this regional effort is 
          succeeding.
          U.S. policy goals in Burma include a return to constitutional 
          democracy, restoration of human rights, including fundamental 
          civil and political rights, national reconciliation, 
          implementation of the rule of law, a more effective 
          counternarcotics effort, HIV/AIDS mitigation, combating 
          trafficking in persons, accounting for missing servicemen from 
          World War II, counterterrorism efforts, and regional 
          stability. We continue to encourage talks between Aung San Suu 
          Kyi and the regime in the hope that the regime will live up to 
          its stated commitment to political transition, leading to 
          meaningful democratic change. We also consult regularly, at 
          senior levels, with countries with major interests in Burma 
          and/or major concerns regarding Burma's current deplorable 
          human rights practices.
          In coordination with the European Union and other states, the 
          United States has maintained sanctions on Burma. These include 
          an arms embargo, ban on new investment, and other measures. 
          Our goal in applying these sanctions is to encourage a 
          transition to democratic rule and greater respect for human 
          rights. Should there be significant progress towards those 
          goals as a result of dialogue between Aung San Suu Kyi and the 
          military government, then the United States would look 
          seriously at measures to support this process of constructive 
          change. Continued absence of positive change would force the 
          U.S. to look at the possibility of increased sanctions in 
          conjunction with the international community.

Measuring Progress toward Democratization

          Efforts to foster peaceful democratic change in Burma have 
          once again ground to a halt over the past six months. While 
          there have been some positive developments, the regime has 
          become more confrontational in its exchanges with the NLD, led 
          by Aung San Suu Kyi, and has offered few signs of progress 
          toward their stated commitment to a political transition to 
          democracy.
          UN Special Envoy Razali Ismail continued his mission, visiting 
          Burma for the eighth time in November 2002. On the positive 
          side, the NLD also continued to rebuild itself as a national 
          party, opening up offices throughout Burma. Altogether, the 
          NLD has now reopened about one-quarter of its township and 
          divisional offices (92 offices out of approximately 360). In 
          addition, the Committee to Represent the People's Parliament 
          (CRPP), a group of parties elected to Parliament in 1990, 
          expanded to a total of 18 elected Members of Parliament (MP). 
          In 1998, the opposition's decision to establish the CRPP led 
          to the arrest of many of the MPs by the regime.
          Finally, the NLD's General Secretary Aung San Suu Kyi 
          continued her travels, visiting Shan and Rakhine States and 
          opening NLD offices in both states. In Shan State, this travel 
          went relatively smoothly; in Rakhine State in December, 
          however, efforts by the United Solidarity Development 
          Association (a ``mass organization'' affiliated with the 
          regime) to discourage any large turnout of crowds for Aung San 
          Suu Kyi, turned ugly. In the town

[[Page 307]]

          of Mrauk Oo Aung San Suu Kyi intervened with local authorities 
          by climbing atop a fire truck to prevent them from dispersing 
          a crowd of 20,000 supporters with water hoses.
          Political prisoner releases stopped as of late November, 
          despite continued appeals from the international community (UN 
          Special Envoy Razali and UN Special Rapporteur Pinheiro, as 
          well as the EU, U.S., and others) for the unconditional 
          release of all political prisoners. Approximately 550 
          political prisoners have been released since October 2000, 
          including 380 NLD party members. However, another 1,300 
          ``security detainees'' still remain in detention, including 
          approximately 110 NLD party members and 17 elected MPs.
          There were also new arrests. Approximately 60 political 
          activists, mostly teachers, lawyers, and students, were 
          detained by the government between August 2002 and March 2003 
          on charges including conspiracy to commit terrorist acts for 
          the simple peaceful expression of political dissent. Due to 
          international pressure, most of these activists were released 
          within days, but one died while in detention (apparently from 
          a lack of medical care), while several were convicted of 
          offences carrying sentences of seven years or more.
          In February 2003 Aung San Suu Kyi was involved in a minor 
          civil law suit brought by a relative that appeared to be 
          politically motivated. Aung San Suu Kyi counter-sued. Both 
          were found guilty. She and other NLD leaders characterized the 
          initial suit as being instigated by the regime and politically 
          motivated. She was given a choice of paying a small fine or 
          being jailed for a week. She refused to admit guilt by paying 
          the fine and indicated her willingness to be jailed for a week 
          as a result. The government then issued a ``suspension of 
          judgment'' decree as several thousand NLD supporters gathered 
          outside the courthouse.
          Most seriously, the regime has shown no inclination to engage 
          the democratic opposition in meaningful political dialogue. 
          The government arranged meetings between Aung San Suu Kyi and 
          the Minister of Education and others, but the NLD leader made 
          clear to UN Special Envoy Razali in October that there was 
          ``no real dialogue'' with the regime. There were also signs of 
          Senior General Than Shwe's frustration with the lack of 
          increased aid or reduced sanctions.
          The hamstrung status quo has frustrated a number of concerned 
          countries. Australian Foreign Minister Downer, Japan's Deputy 
          Foreign Minister Tanaka, and the EU Troika visited Burma over 
          the past several months and Japan's Prime Minister Koizumi 
          reportedly weighed in on behalf of reform at ASEAN Summit in 
          Phnom Penh in November; however, no one has yet been able to 
          move the process forward. At the most recent meeting of the 
          U.N. Contact Group on Burma, held in Tokyo in February, there 
          was little consensus on next steps and what new strategies 
          could be effective. Both the EU and the United States are now 
          considering the advisability of increasing sanctions on Burma.

[[Page 308]]

Counternarcotics

          The United States judged earlier this year that Burma had 
          ``failed demonstrably'' to make substantial efforts to 
          cooperate on narcotics matters, primarily due to the failure 
          to stem the production and flow of amphetamine-type stimulants 
          into neighboring countries. At the same time, the USG has 
          sustained a successful program of cooperation between police 
          authorities in Burma and the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
          Administration. Since 1993 the USG and GOB have cooperated on 
          annual opium yield surveys in Burma and with UNODC and other 
          donors on opium reduction and crop substitution programs. In 
          June 2002, the United States pledged an additional $700,000 to 
          support UNODC's Wa Alternative Development Project, which 
          helped reduce opium production in the territories of one of 
          the most notorious former insurgent groups, the United Wa 
          State Army.
          While Burma is the world's second largest producer of illicit 
          opium, its overall production in 2002 was only a fraction of 
          its production in the mid-1990s. According to the joint U.S./
          Burma opium yield survey, opium production in Burma totaled no 
          more than 630 metric tons in 2002, down 26 percent from 2001, 
          and less than one-quarter of the 2,560 metric tons produced in 
          Burma in 1996. Burma's success in reducing the production of 
          opium and heroin, however, has been offset by increasing 
          production of amphetamine-type stimulants, particularly in 
          outlying regions governed by former insurgents that are not 
          under the effective control of the Rangoon government. 
          According to some estimates, as many as 400 to 800 million 
          methamphetamine tablets may be produced in Burma each year. 
          Due to the mobile, small-scale nature of the methamphetamine 
          production facilities both reliable data and effective law 
          enforcement measures are difficult. Burma does not have a 
          chemical industry, and as far as we know, does not produce any 
          of the precursors for synthetic drugs. This highlights the 
          regional character of this problem and the need for regional 
          cooperation to put an end to drug flows from the region.
          There are reliable reports that individual Burmese officials 
          in outlying areas are involved in narcotics production or 
          trafficking or offering protection for these activities. In 
          addition, while the government says it urges former ethnic 
          insurgents to curb narcotics production and trafficking in 
          their self-administered areas along the Chinese border, it has 
          only recently, with the support and assistance of China, begun 
          to crack down hard on some of these groups. Since September 
          2001, it has begun to enforce pledges from these former 
          insurgent groups to make their self-administered areas opium-
          free and has pressured groups (including the Wa and the Kokang 
          Chinese) into issuing decrees outlawing narcotics production 
          and trafficking in areas under their control. According to 
          early reports from UNODC's opium surveyors, the cultivation in 
          traditional growing areas has been reduced. However, the Wa 
          have not committed to eliminating narcotics production until 
          2005. The Burmese junta gauges that any military operation to 
          end production would be extremely costly.
          In recent years, Burma continues to improve its cooperation 
          with neighboring states, particularly China. In 2001, Burma 
          signed memoranda of understanding on narcotics control with 
          both China and Thailand. The MOU with China established a 
          framework for joint operations, which in turn led to a series 
          of arrests and renditions of major traffickers in 2001 and 
          2002, many of whom were captured in the former insurgents' 
          self-administered

[[Page 309]]

          areas. Over the past two years Burma has returned over 30 
          Chinese fugitives to China, including principals from one 
          group that China described as ``the largest armed drug-
          trafficking gang in the Golden Triangle.'' Burma's MOU with 
          Thailand has committed both sides to closer police cooperation 
          on narcotics control and to the establishment of three joint 
          ``narcotics suppression coordination stations'' at major 
          crossing points on the border. Recent visits by Thai Prime 
          Minister Thaksin and other Thai officials to Rangoon made 
          narcotics cooperation a centerpiece of bilateral relations. In 
          addition, India participated in a January 2003 meeting with 
          China and Burma in Rangoon on precursor control. As a result, 
          India is now exploring the possibility of establishing a 100-
          mile wide ``restricted area'' within which any possession of 
          ephedrine, acetic anhydride, or other drug precursors would be 
          criminalized. If adopted by Thailand and China, such action 
          could have a major impact on amphetamine production in areas 
          not under Rangoon's effective control.
          Burma is part of every major multilateral narcotics control 
          program in the region. It is a party to the 1961 UN Single 
          Convention, the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 
          and the 1988 UN Drug Convention. It has also announced that it 
          will shortly adhere to the 1972 Protocol to the 1961 Single 
          Convention. Burma has also supported UNODC's 1993 Memorandum 
          of Understanding that was signed among the six regional 
          states_Burma, China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia_to 
          control narcotics production. Finally, as China and Thailand 
          have become more active multilaterally, Burma has joined all 
          trilateral and quadrilateral programs organized by either to 
          coordinate counter-narcotics efforts among the four states of 
          the Golden Triangle (Laos, Burma, China, and Thailand).
          Under pressure from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), 
          the Government of Burma has taken action on money laundering 
          issues. In June 2002 the GOB enacted a new money laundering 
          law that criminalized money laundering in connection with most 
          major offenses, including terrorism and narcotics trafficking. 
          A Central Control Board chaired by the Minister of Home 
          Affairs was established in July; training for financial 
          investigators was conducted in Rangoon and Mandalay in August 
          and September, and the initial investigations were begun in 
          July 2002. Using the provisions of the law, assets have been 
          frozen and/or seized in several major narcotics-related cases. 
          With assistance from UNODC, the Burmese government is also in 
          the process of drafting a new mutual legal assistance law, 
          which should lay the groundwork for judicial and law 
          enforcement cooperation across borders in the prosecution of 
          money laundering and other cases.

The Quality of Life in Burma

          The Economy: Economic developments in Burma were punctuated in 
          February and March 2003 by a banking crisis centered on 
          several major private banks. Undermined by soaring inflation 
          and government restrictions on interest rates, Burma's private 
          banks were shaken to their roots by the collapse of several 
          unofficial financial institutions in January 2003. During 
          February, approximately 40 percent of the banks' deposits were 
          withdrawn, obliging the banks to restrict withdrawals, call in 
          loans, and apply to the Central Bank for emergency assistance. 
          The run has focused on private

[[Page 310]]

          banks, especially those with Chinese or Chinese-Burmese 
          ownership. Government-owned and joint venture banks with 
          government participation have not been affected, presumably 
          because the public is more confident of government support in 
          those cases. Burmese-owned private banks have also escaped the 
          extreme pressures applied to the Chinese-owned banks, 
          presumably again because depositors are more confident of 
          government support in those cases.
          Looking ahead, several private banks may fail within the next 
          several months. Since the private banks hold a majority of 
          bank deposits in Burma, this will have a major impact on their 
          customers' savings and on the payments system throughout 
          Burma. A good portion of the inflation that plagued Burma over 
          the past two years was generated by the uncontrolled credit 
          and investment operations of the informal financial 
          institutions, which have now collapsed. With them gone and the 
          banking system crippled by the current run, inflation should 
          decline, while the kyat, now suddenly in short supply, 
          strengthens. Since the start of the crisis in February, the 
          values of both gold and the dollar have fallen by about 20 
          percent against the kyat, while general price inflation has 
          moderated. Both trends should continue in the months ahead.
          In the energy sector, some good luck has saved the government 
          from the consequences of a string of disastrous public 
          investment decisions. As it turns out, a crash government 
          exploration program has turned up enough natural gas onshore 
          to ensure against a recurrence of the severe load shedding and 
          blackouts that plagued the economy in 2002. Where in January 
          2002 the nation's peak generating capacity was sufficient to 
          meet only about two-thirds of the nation's peak demand, it now 
          appears that all, or virtually all customers in Rangoon and 
          other major cities are getting electricity on a regular basis. 
          In 2004, several major hydropower projects are due to come on 
          line and, provided that the new-found gas holds out that long, 
          Burma may finally be able to put its long-running energy 
          problems behind it.
          In the fiscal budget, the situation continues to be desperate, 
          but not so desperate as thought earlier. There, a failed 
          fiscal concept, in which the GOB attempted to run the entire 
          government on the basis of the profits of the state-owned 
          enterprises, has left the GOB without any basis for long-term 
          planning, as profits have turned to losses in one state-owned 
          enterprise after another. In fact, in Burma's fiscal year 
          2001/2002, the deficits of the state-owned enterprises 
          actually absorbed all the revenues collected by the 
          government, leaving the government proper (i.e., the army, the 
          navy, the health and education services, and all ministerial 
          operations) to run on the basis of monies borrowed from the 
          Central Bank. This has over the past two years produced a 
          rapid expansion of the money supply, a commensurate increase 
          in inflation and a sharp depreciation in the value of the 
          domestic currency.
          The collapse of the informal financial institutions has had a 
          deflationary effect. Previously propped-up asset values have 
          collapsed and relatively high interest rates for savers have 
          also gone away. Thus, the inflation associated with the 
          government's mismanaged fiscal expansion will have less 
          impact.

          Human Rights: The Government of Burma severely abuses the 
          human rights of its citizens. Burmese do not have the right to 
          change their government. Nor is there any real freedom of 
          speech, press, assembly, association, or travel. Religious 
          minorities (particularly Christians and Muslims) are 
          discriminated against and any form of proselytizing activity 
          is actively discouraged. Burma was designated a Country of 
          Particular Concern for particularly severe violations 
          religious freedom in 2002. Security forces also regularly 
          monitor citizens' movements and communications, search homes 
          without warrants, and relocate persons forcibly without 
          compensation or legal recourse.
          Patterns of abuses are worse in ethnic minority areas. These 
          abuses include censorship, persecution, beatings, 
          disappearances, extrajudicial executions, the curtailing of 
          religious freedom, forced relocations, rapes, and forced 
          labor, including conscription of child soldiers. Several 
          reports by non-governmental organizations have been published 
          this year alleging human rights abuses by the Burmese military 
          on Burmese civilians including rapes of hundreds of women 
          between 1992 and 2001. The regime initially denied these 
          charges but, after conducting investigations, conceded that it 
          had identified five cases (out of the 173 presented by SHRF) 
          whose circumstances approximate those described by SHRF. The 
          international community is calling for an independent 
          investigation by competent officials from outside Burma 
          conducting private interviews with victims in an atmosphere of 
          security and free of reprisals. In March 2003, UN Special 
          Rapporteur for Human Rights Pinheiro visited Burma to discuss 
          the human rights situation there, including prospects for an 
          independent, credible investigation of the rape allegations. 
          However, he cut his visit short when he learned that his 
          supposedly confidential discussions with political prisoners 
          were being monitored by Burmese authorities.
          In August 2002, a Burma Army Captain raped a four-year-old 
          girl in a village in Kayah State, and local officials 
          attempted to cover up the crime when villagers first 
          complained to them. However, the government has since taken 
          action. The Captain was brought back to Rangoon in handcuffs, 
          and the Commander and Deputy Commander of the Captain's 
          battalion were relieved of command for their mishandling of 
          the incident. Reportedly, there have been no reprisals against 
          the villagers.
          There had been no releases of political prisoners since late 
          November 2002 until shortly before Pinheiro arrived in March 
          2003. The regime claimed to have released 45 prisoners on 
          March 16, including ``elderly inmates, females either pregnant 
          or with young children, and those incarcerated for disturbing 
          peace and tranquility.'' Three to four of those released were 
          NLD members. Approximately 550 political prisoners have been 
          released since October 2000, including approximately 380 NLD 
          party members. However another 1,300 ``security detainees'' 
          (including pro-democracy activists, lawyers, students, 
          teachers, journalists, insurgents, and those accused of aiding 
          insurgents) still remain in prison. Of these, about 110 are 
          NLD members and 17 are elected Members of Parliament. Another 
          400 prisoners (mainly mothers with young children) were 
          released on humanitarian grounds. U.N. Special Rapporteur 
          Pinheiro and U.N. Special Envoy, along with members of the 
          international community, have consistently and strongly 
          pressed for the unconditional release of all political 
          prisoners. This appeal has thus far not been answered. The 
          United States continues to recognize

[[Page 312]]

          the results of the 1990 elections and will continue to push 
          for the full restoration of the civil and political rights of 
          the people of Burma.
          Instead of more releases of prisoners, as pledged, arrests of 
          political activists continued in late 2002 and early 2003. 
          Between August 2002 and March 2003, the government detained 
          approximately 60 activists for peaceably promoting democracy 
          and freedom. While most of these activists were released 
          within days of their arrest, there were reports that several 
          were beaten or otherwise abused while in detention. In 
          addition, one detainee died (apparently as a result of a lack 
          of medical attention), while others were convicted and sent to 
          prison for periods of seven years or more. However, the 
          aggregate number of political prisoners and security detainees 
          has decreased by dozens at least in the period covered by this 
          report.
          The regime has allowed the United Nations High Commission on 
          Refugees to maintain a presence in northern Rakhine State, 
          providing support and protection services to more than 230,000 
          Rohingya Muslims who have returned from Bangladesh. After 
          nearly a decade, however, some 22,000 Rohingya refugees still 
          remain in two refugee camps in Bangladesh and another 
          estimated 200,000 Rohingya live illegally in southernmost 
          Bangladesh. In spite of ongoing repatriation efforts, for the 
          last few years repatriations to Burma have not kept up with 
          the camp birthrates and restrictions on movement in Burma have 
          made life exceedingly difficult for this population. There are 
          concerns that members of this disenfranchised population have 
          been recruited by terrorist organizations.
          Furthermore, more than 132,000 other Burmese ethnic minority 
          displaced persons live in several refugee camps along the 
          border in Thailand, and an estimated two million Burmese, both 
          ethnic minorities and ethnic Burmans, live illegally in 
          Thailand; many of these are economic migrants rather than 
          political refugees. The tens of thousands of Burmese and 
          ethnic minorities living illegally in the countries 
          surrounding Burma are willing to endure an often perilous 
          existence because they believe it is even more dangerous to 
          return to Burma.
          Forced labor also remained an issue of serious concern to the 
          international community, despite some (still relatively 
          ineffective) government efforts to control the practice. In 
          June 2000, the International Labor Conference concluded that 
          the Government of Burma had not taken effective action to deal 
          with the use of forced labor in the country and, for the first 
          time in the history of the International Labor Organization 
          (ILO), it called on all ILO members to review their policies 
          to ensure that those policies did not support forced labor. 
          The ILO Governing Body implemented this decision in November 
          2000. The United States strongly supported this decision.
          Over the past 18 months, the Government of Burma has slowly 
          begun to work with the ILO on procedural measures to address 
          the problem. In September 2001, it allowed an ILO High Level 
          Team to visit Burma to assess the situation. That team 
          concluded that the GOB had made an ``obvious, but uneven'' 
          effort to curtail the use of forced labor, but that forced 
          labor persisted, particularly in areas where the Burma Army 
          was waging active military campaigns against insurgent forces. 
          The team recommended that the ILO establish a presence in 
          Burma, a step that was finally completed in October 2002 with 
          the opening of an ILO Liaison Office in Rangoon. In

[[Page 313]]

          August 2002, the ILO began field visits to sites along the 
          Thai/Burmese border that have been identified by Amnesty 
          International and other organizations as ``hot spots'' for 
          forced labor and Burmese Army abuse of ethnic minorities. The 
          ILO Liaison Officer has also attempted to engage the GOB in 
          discussions to develop a ``viable plan of action'' to 
          eliminate forced labor as demanded by the ILO Governing Body 
          in November 2002, but so far these efforts have been 
          unsuccessful. While the GOB has made some procedural 
          concessions to ILO demands, the GOB has still not prosecuted 
          any individual for use of forced labor, and there is abundant 
          evidence that the centuries-old tradition of forced labor in 
          Burma continues. As a result, the ILO has continued to press 
          for an effective investigative body, the appointment of an 
          independent ombudsman to report on violations, and the 
          elimination of forced labor in law and practice. The use of 
          forced labor to build infrastructure for tourist sites appears 
          to be reduced from levels reported in the late 1990's. In 
          recent years, there have been isolated reports of forced labor 
          at tourist sites.
          Burma was ranked as a Tier 3 country in the Department's 2002 
          Trafficking in Persons Report. Since the publication of that 
          report, the GOB has tried to make more transparent that it is 
          taking steps against sexual exploitation trafficking, which 
          most often involves the clandestine movement of Burmese women 
          and children from ethnic minority areas into Thailand. The 
          Myanmar National Committee on Women's Affairs has taken 
          measures to help educate vulnerable populations on the dangers 
          of trafficking by distributing booklets, producing some media 
          programming and organizing community talks. The Ministry of 
          Home Affairs and the Attorney General's office have carried 
          out arrests and prosecutions of traffickers. The effectiveness 
          of these efforts appears to be uneven and difficult to 
          evaluate given the government's overall credibility and the 
          political climate in the country, but this represents what 
          seems to be a genuine engagement of some senior government 
          officials to fighting sex trafficking. The GOB has also 
          allowed some limited but important NGO and international 
          organization activity to assist returning trafficking victims 
          and educate officials, but the government needs to be open to 
          much more of this kind of cooperation. The GOB has 
          concentrated its efforts in fighting sex trafficking, although 
          officials are aware that the international definition of 
          trafficking in persons also encompasses labor exploitation.
          The regime did allow a visit by Amnesty International (AI) in 
          February 2003. During the visit, the AI delegation met with 
          government ministers and other officials, as well as with Aung 
          San Suu Kyi and other members of the NLD. AI used their 
          meetings with government officials to discuss the conditions 
          under which political prisoners are held and to call for the 
          immediate release of 19 prisoners on humanitarian grounds.
          The Environment: Illegal logging and illicit trade in wildlife 
          and wildlife products are overwhelming efforts at protection. 
          To help deal with both of these issues, the Ministry of 
          Forestry has instituted a program to increase the size of 
          protected areas, but pressures are mounting as agricultural 
          lands expand. Other concerns include threats to reefs and 
          fisheries and overall water resource management.

Development of a Multilateral Strategy

          U.S. policy goals in Burma include a return to constitutional 
          democracy, the institution of a rule of law, improved human 
          rights, national reconciliation, counterterrorism efforts, 
          regional stability, HIV/AIDS mitigation, combating trafficking 
          in persons, accounting for missing servicemen from World War 
          II, and more effective counternarcotics efforts. We encourage 
          talks between Aung San Suu Kyi and the military government in 
          the hope that it will lead to meaningful democratic change in 
          Burma. We also consult regularly, at senior levels, with 
          countries with major interests in Burma and/or major concerns 
          regarding Burma's human rights practices.
          The United States has co-sponsored annual resolutions at the 
          UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights that 
          target Burma. We have also supported the ILO's unprecedented 
          decision on Burma given its failure to deal effectively with 
          its severe and pervasive forced labor problems. Most 
          importantly, we strongly support the mission of the UN 
          Secretary General's Special Representative for Burma, Razali 
          Ismail, whose efforts are key in facilitating the start of any 
          meaningful political dialogue between the regime and the NLD.
          In coordination with the European Union and others, the United 
          States has imposed sanctions on Burma. These sanctions include 
          an arms embargo, a ban on all new U.S. investment in Burma, 
          the suspension of all bilateral aid, the withdrawal of GSP 
          privileges, the denial of OPIC and EXIMBANK programs, visa 
          restrictions on Burma's senior leaders, and a vote against any 
          loan or other utilization of funds to or for Burma by 
          international financial institutions in which the United 
          States has a major interest. We have also maintained our 
          diplomatic representation at the Charg[eacute] d'Affaires 
          level since 1990.
          Our goal in applying these sanctions is to encourage a 
          transition to democratic rule and greater respect for human 
          rights. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about the growing 
          humanitarian crisis in Burma. In 2002, we initiated a $1 
          million program to address the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic in 
          Burma by funding only international non-governmental 
          organizations (INGOs) to undertake prevention activities; no 
          assistance is direct to the regime. Discussions with the 
          government continue on allowing INGOs to conduct voluntary HIV 
          testing and counseling, as well as a greater commitment to 
          more effective prevention, treatment, and care programs, 
          including for pregnant mothers and high risk groups. We also 
          use a portion of the funding from the U.S. Burma earmark to 
          develop programs in support of democracy in Burma, as well as 
          democracy, social, educational, and governance-related 
          programs outside Burma. None of these funds are disbursed to 
          or through the Government of Burma. We will also continue to 
          examine the potential for cooperation with Burma on terrorism 
          and narcotics issues. Should there be significant progress in 
          Burma in coming months on political transition, economic 
          reform, and human rights, the United States would look 
          seriously at additional measures that could be applied to 
          support the process of constructive change. Absent progress, 
          we will be forced to consider, in conjunction with the 
          international community, additional sanctions and/or other 
          measures.

Memorandum of April 17, 2003

Authority to Hold Harmless and Indemnify in Certain

Circumstances Under One Contract

Memorandum for the Administrator of the United States Agency for 
International Development

          1. You are authorized for the United States Agency for 
          International Development (USAID) to exercise authority under 
          Public Law 85	804, as amended (50 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.), to the 
          same extent and subject to the same conditions and limitations 
          as the head of a department or agency listed in section 21 of 
          Executive Order 10789 of November 14, 1958, as amended, with 
          respect to one contract identified in subparagraph (a) of this 
          memorandum and solely for the purpose identified in 
          subparagraph (b).
          (a) The contract is for repair and reconstruction in Iraq and 
          is awarded on or before September 30, 2003.
          (b) The purpose is to hold harmless and indemnify with respect 
          to claims, losses, or damage arising out of or resulting from 
          exposure, in the course of performance of the contract to 
          which subparagraph (a) refers, to:

  (i) chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons, agents, or 
materials;

  (ii) land or sea mines or similar explosive devices; or

  (iii) unexploded ordnance.

          2. The function performed by USAID in awarding the contract to 
          which paragraph 1 refers is a function connected with the 
          national defense. There are currently national emergencies 
          that have been declared by the President in accordance with 
          applicable law. I deem that the authorization provided by 
          paragraph 1 and actions taken pursuant to that authorization 
          would facilitate the national defense.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

Memorandum of April 25, 2003

Presidential Determination on Wire Hanger Imports from the People's 
Republic of China

Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Labor[, and] 
the United States Trade Representative

          Pursuant to section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
          (19 U.S.C. 2451), I have determined the action I will take 
          with respect to the affirmative determination of the United 
          States International Trade Commission (USITC Investigation TA	
          421	2) regarding imports of certain steel wire garment hangers 
          from China. After considering all relevant aspects of the 
          investigation, I have determined that providing import relief 
          for the U.S. wire hanger industry is not in the national 
          economic interest of the United States. In particular, I find 
          that import relief would have an adverse impact on the United 
          States economy clearly greater than the benefits of such 
          action.
          The facts of this case indicate that imposing additional 
          tariffs on Chinese imports would affect domestic producers 
          unevenly, favoring one business strategy over another. While 
          most of the producers would likely realize some income 
          benefits, additional tariffs would disrupt the long-term 
          adjustment strategy of one major producer, which is based in 
          part on distribution of imported hangers, and cause that 
          producer to incur substantial costs.
          In addition, most domestic producers, including the 
          petitioners, have begun to pursue adjustment strategies. While 
          these strategies have included consolidation, modernization of 
          production facilities, and expansion into complementary 
          products and services, domestic producers are also expanding 
          their use of imports. Indeed, a substantial part of the surge 
          in imports during the most recent period measured was brought 
          in by domestic producers themselves, including the 
          petitioners.
          Moreover, after 6 years of competing with Chinese imports, 
          domestic producers still account for over 85 percent of the 
          U.S. wire hanger market. With this dominant share of the 
          market, domestic producers have the opportunity to adjust to 
          competition from Chinese imports even without import relief.
          Furthermore, there is a strong possibility that if additional 
          tariffs on Chinese wire hangers were imposed, production would 
          simply shift to third countries, which could not be subject to 
          section 421's China-specific restrictions. In that event, 
          import relief would have little or no benefit for any domestic 
          producer.
          Additional tariffs would have an uneven impact on domestic 
          distributors of wire hangers. For some distributors, the 
          tariffs would likely lead to some

[[Page 318]]

          income benefits. However, the tariffs would likely harm other 
          distributors in light of their business models.
          Additional tariffs would also likely have a negative effect on 
          the thousands of small, family-owned dry-cleaning businesses 
          across the United States that would either have to absorb the 
          resulting increased costs or pass them on to their customers.
          The circumstances of this case make clear that the U.S. 
          national economic interest would not be served by the 
          imposition of import relief under section 421. I remain fully 
          committed to exercising the important authority granted to me 
          under section 421 when the circumstances of a particular case 
          warrant it.
          Section 421 is not the only avenue available to the 
          petitioning domestic producers as they seek to adjust to 
          import competition. I hereby direct the Secretary of Commerce 
          and the Secretary of Labor to expedite consideration of any 
          Trade Adjustment Assistance applications received from 
          domestic hanger producers or their workers and to provide such 
          other requested assistance or relief as they deem appropriate, 
          consistent with their statutory mandates.
          The United States Trade Representative is authorized and 
          directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of May 16, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma

          On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, 
          certifying to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign 
          Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs 
          Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104	208), that the 
          Government of Burma has committed large-scale repression of 
          the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 1996, 
          thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
          United States persons contained in that section. The President 
          also declared a national emergency to deal with the threat 
          posed to the national security and foreign policy of the 
          United States by the actions and policies of the Government of 
          Burma, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the 
          International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et 
          seq.
          Because actions and policies of the Government of Burma 
          continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
          national security and foreign policy of the United States, the 
          national emergency declared on May 20, 1997, and the measures 
          adopted on that date to deal with that emergency must continue 
          in effect beyond May 20, 2003. Therefore, in accordance with 
          section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
          1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency 
          with respect to Burma. This notice shall be published in the

Notice of June 10, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to the Risk of Nuclear 
Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Usable Fissile 
Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

          On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 
          (the ``Order'') blocking property and interests in property of 
          the Government of the Russian Federation that are in the 
          United States, that hereafter come within the United States, 
          or that are or hereinafter come within the possession or 
          control of United States persons that are directly related to 
          the implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of 
          the United States of America and the Government of the Russian 
          Federation Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched 
          Uranium Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 
          1993, and related contracts and agreements (collectively, the 
          ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU Agreements allow

[[Page 323]]

          for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived from 
          nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful 
          commercial purposes. The Order invoked the authority, inter 
          alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 
          U.S.C. 1701 et seq., and declared a national emergency to deal 
          with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
          security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the 
          risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of a 
          large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the 
          territory of the Russian Federation.
          A major national security goal of the United States is to 
          ensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear 
          weapons pursuant to various arms control and disarmament 
          agreements is dedicated to peaceful uses (such as downblended 
          to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial uses), subject 
          to transparency measures, and protected from diversion to 
          activities of proliferation concern. Pursuant to the HEU 
          Agreements, weapons-grade uranium extracted from Russian 
          nuclear weapons is converted to low enriched uranium for use 
          as fuel in commercial nuclear reactors. The Order blocks and 
          protects from attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, 
          garnishment, or other judicial process the property and 
          interests in property of the Government of the Russian 
          Federation that are directly related to the implementation of 
          the HEU Agreements and that are in the United States, that 
          hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
          hereafter come within the possession or control of United 
          States persons.
          The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must 
          continue beyond June 21, 2003, to provide continued protection 
          from attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, 
          garnishment, or other judicial process for the property and 
          interests in property of the Government of the Russian 
          Federation that are directly related to the implementation of 
          the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. 
          Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
          Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
          year the national emergency with respect to weapons-usable 
          fissile material in the territory of the Russian Federation. 
          This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western Balkans

          On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, I declared a 
          national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans 
          pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
          (50 U.S.C. 1701	1706) to deal with the unusual and 
          extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
          policy of the United States constituted by the actions of 
          persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting, 
          (i) extremist violence in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
          Macedonia, and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, or 
          (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the Dayton Accords in 
          Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 
          June 10, 1999, in Kosovo. Subsequent to the declaration of the 
          national emergency, the actions of persons obstructing 
          implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in the 
          former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have also become a 
          pressing concern. I amended Executive Order 13219 on May 28, 
          2003, in Executive Order 13304 to address this concern and to 
          take additional steps with respect to the national emergency. 
          Because the actions of persons threatening the peace and 
          international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans 
          continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
          national security and foreign policy of the United States, the 
          national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures 
          adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that 
          emergency must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2003. 
          Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
          Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
          year the national emergency with respect to the Western 
          Balkans.
          This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
          transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of July 31, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iraq

          On August 2, 1990, by Executive Order 12722, President Bush 
          declared a national emergency with respect to Iraq pursuant to 
          the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
          1701	1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat 
          to the national security and foreign policy of the United 
          States constituted by the actions and policies of the 
          Government of Iraq_the Saddam Hussein regime. By Executive 
          Orders 12722 of August 2, 1990, and 12724 of August 9, 1990, 
          the President imposed trade sanctions on Iraq and blocked 
          Iraqi government assets. Additional measures were taken with 
          respect to this national emergency by Executive Order 13290 of 
          March 20, 2003. Because of the continued instability in Iraq, 
          the United States and Coalition partners' role as the 
          temporary authority in Iraq, and the need to ensure the 
          establishment of a process leading to representative Iraqi 
          self-rule, the national emergency declared on August 2, 1990, 
          and the measures adopted on August 2 and August 9, 1990, and 
          March 20, 2003, to deal with that emergency must continue in 
          effect beyond August 2, 2003. Therefore, in accordance with 
          section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 
          1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency 
          with respect to Iraq.

Presidential Determination No. 2003-29 of August 4, 2003

Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and 
Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          Consistent with section (2)(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee 
          Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I 
          hereby determine that it is important to the national interest 
          that up to $26 million be made available from the U.S. 
          Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund for a 
          contribution to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
          Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to meet 
          unexpected, urgent refugee needs in the West Bank and Gaza.
          You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate 
          committees of the Congress of this determination and the 
          obligation of funds under this authority, and to arrange for

Notice of August 7, 2003

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

          On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided me 
          under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
          U.S.C. 170l et seq.), I issued Executive Order 13222. In that 
          order, I declared a national emergency with respect to the 
          unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
          foreign policy, and economy of the United States in light of 
          the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as 
          amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). Because the Export 
          Administration Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the 
          national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, and renewed on 
          August 14, 2002, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 
          2003. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
          National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing 
          for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
          13222.

          Consistent with the authority contained in section 604 of the 
          FY 2003 Foreign Relations Authorization Act (Public Law 107	
          228) (the ``Act''), and with reference to the determinations

          consistent with section 603 of that Act, regarding

          certain commitments, I hereby impose the sanction set out in 
          section 604(a)(2) ``Downgrade in Status of the PLO Office in 
          the United States.'' This sanction is imposed for a period of 
          180 days from the date hereof or until such time as the next 
          report required by section 603 of the Act is transmitted to 
          the Congress, whichever is later. You are authorized and 
          directed to transmit to the appropriate congressional 
          committees the initial report described in section 603 of the 
          Act.
          Furthermore, I hereby determine that it is in the national 
          security interest of the United States to waive that sanction, 
          pursuant to section 604 of the Act. This waiver shall be 
          effective for a period of 180 days from the date hereof or

Determination on Turkmenistan

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          Pursuant to Presidential Determination 98	7 of December 5, 
          1997, Turkmenistan was found to be not in violation of 
          paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection 402(a) of the Trade 
          Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2432(a) and 2439(a)) (the ``Act'') or 
          paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection 409(a) of the

[[Page 330]]

          Act. That determination with respect to Turkmenistan is no 
          longer in effect.
          Consistent with section 402(c)(2)(A) of the Act, I determine 
          that a waiver by Executive Order of the application of 
          subsections (a) and (b) of section 402 of the Act with respect 
          to Turkmenistan will substantially promote the objectives of 
          section 402.
          On my behalf, please transmit this determination to the 
          Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the President 
          of the Senate.

Resumption of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of 
Colombia

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense

          Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the 
          National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as 
          amended (22 U.S.C. section 2291	4), I hereby certify, with 
          respect to Colombia, that: (1) interdiction of aircraft 
          reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in illicit drug 
          trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary because of 
          the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to 
          the national security of that country; and (2) that country 
          has appropriate procedures in place to protect against 
          innocent loss of life in the air and on the ground in 
          connection with such interdiction, which shall at a minimum 
          include effective means to identify and warn an aircraft 
          before the use of force is directed against the aircraft.
          The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish 
          this determination in the Federal Register and to notify the 
          Congress of this determination.

Assistance for Voluntary Population Planning

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          On March 28, 2001, I issued a memorandum for the Administrator 
          of the United States Agency for International Development 
          (USAID) directing that certain conditions be placed on 
          assistance for family planning activities provided to foreign 
          nongovernmental organizations by USAID.
          Because family planning grants are awarded by the Department 
          of State outside of USAID as well as through USAID, you are 
          hereby directed to extend the requirements of the March 28, 
          2001, memorandum to all assistance for voluntary population 
          planning furnished to foreign nongovernmental organizations 
          and appropriated pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act, 
          whether such assistance is furnished by USAID or any other 
          bureau, office, or component of the Department of State.
          As set forth in the March 28, 2001, memorandum, this policy 
          applies to certain assistance provided to foreign 
          nongovernmental organizations. Such organizations do not 
          include multilateral organizations that are associations of 
          governments. This policy shall not apply to foreign assistance 
          furnished pursuant to the United States Leadership Against 
          HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (Public Law 
          108	25).
          The foregoing directive is issued consistent with the 
          authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the 
          United States of America, including sections 104 and 104A of 
          the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.

          the Secretary of Transportation in Executive Order 13223 to 
          the Secretary of Homeland Security.

          Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency 
          declared on September 14, 2001, and the measures taken on 
          September 14, 2001, November 16, 2001, and January 16, 2002, 
          to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond 
          September 14, 2003. Therefore, I am continuing in effect for 
          an additional year the national emergency I declared on 
          September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist threat.
          This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
          transmitted to the Congress.

U.S. Contribution to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization: 
Determination Regarding Funds Under the Heading ``Nonproliferation, Anti-
Terrorism, Demining and Related Programs'' in Title II of the Foreign 
Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations, 2003, 
Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 
108-7) (the ``Act'')

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          Consistent with the authority vested in me by section 562 of 
          Division E of the Act, I hereby determine that it is vital to 
          the national security interests of the United States to waive 
          the restriction in that section and provide up to $3.72 
          million in funds made available under the heading 
          ``Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and Related 
          Programs'' in title II of Division E of the Act, for 
          assistance to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development 
          Organization (KEDO) for administrative expenses only.
          You are hereby authorized and directed to report this 
          determination and the accompanying Memorandum of

Presidential Determination No. 2003-38 of September 15, 2003

Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug 
Producing Countries for 2004

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          Consistent with section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations 
          Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107	228) (the 
          ``FRAA''), I hereby identify the following countries as major 
          drug-transit or major illicit drug producing countries: 
          Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, China, 
          Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, 
          India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, 
          Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.
          The Majors List applies by its terms to ``countries''. The 
          United States Government interprets the term broadly to 
          include entities that exercise autonomy over actions or 
          omissions that could lead to a decision to place them on the 
          list and, subsequently, to determine their eligibility for 
          certification. A country's presence on the Majors List is not 
          necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's 
          counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the 
          United States.
          Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug-
          transit or drug-producing country set forth in section 
          481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended 
          (the ``FAA''), one of the reasons that major drug-transit or 
          drug producing countries are placed on the list is the 
          combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors 
          that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the 
          concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures. 
          Consistent with section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby 
          designate Burma and Haiti as countries that have failed 
          demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their 
          obligations under international counternarcotics agreements 
          and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the 
          FAA. Attached to this report are justifications (statements of 
          explanation) for each of the countries so designated, as 
          required by section 706(2)(B).
          I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of 
          section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that provision of U.S. 
          assistance to Haiti in FY 2004 is vital to the national 
          interests of the United States.
          Combating the threat of synthetic drugs remains a priority, 
          particularly the threat from club drugs, including MDMA 
          (Ecstasy). Since January, we have redoubled our efforts with 
          The Netherlands, from which the majority of U.S. MDMA seizures 
          originate. I commend the Government of The Netherlands for its 
          efforts to address this scourge, including increased 
          enforcement, improved risk assessment and targeting 
          capabilities of passenger aircraft and cargo, and 
          international cooperation to control precursor chemicals. I 
          urge the Government of The Netherlands to focus its efforts on 
          dismantling the significant criminal organizations responsible 
          for this illicit trade, using all tools available to law 
          enforcement. Continued progress in implementing our joint 
          action plan, developed in March, should have a significant 
          impact on the production and transit of MDMA from The 
          Netherlands to the United States. Although we have seen a 
          stabilization of MDMA use rates domestically, there is an 
          increase in the number of countries in

[[Page 337]]

          which MDMA is produced and trafficked. We will continue to 
          monitor the threat from synthetic drugs and the emerging 
          trends.
          The United States and Canada are both targeted by 
          international trafficking organizations. We continue to work 
          closely with the Government of Canada to stem the flow of 
          illicit drugs to our countries and across our common borders. 
          The United States remains concerned about the diversion of 
          large quantities of precursor chemicals from Canada into the 
          United States for use in producing methamphetamines. We hope 
          that Canada's newly implemented control regulations will 
          disrupt that flow. The United States is also concerned about 
          widespread Canadian cultivation of high-potency marijuana, 
          significant amounts of which are smuggled into the United 
          States from Canada. We will work with the Government of Canada 
          in the coming year to combat these shared threats to the 
          security and health of our citizens.
          In the 8 months since my January determination that Guatemala 
          had failed demonstrably in regard to its counternarcotics 
          responsibilities, the Government of Guatemala has made efforts 
          to improve its institutional capabilities, adhere to its 
          obligations under international counternarcotics agreements, 
          and take measures set forth in U.S. law. These initial steps 
          show Guatemala's willingness to better its counternarcotics 
          practices, but the permanence of these improvements has yet to 
          be demonstrated. I expect Guatemala to continue its efforts 
          and to demonstrate further progress in the coming year.
          We are deeply concerned about heroin and methamphetamine 
          linked to North Korea being trafficked to East Asian 
          countries, and are increasingly convinced that state agents 
          and enterprises in the DPRK are involved in the narcotics 
          trade. While we suspect opium poppy is cultivated in the DPRK, 
          reliable information confirming the extent of opium production 
          is currently lacking. There are also clear indications that 
          North Koreans traffic in, and probably manufacture, 
          methamphetamine. In recent years, authorities in the region 
          have routinely seized shipments of methamphetamine and/or 
          heroin that had been transferred to traffickers' ships from 
          North Korean vessels. The April 2003 seizure of 125 kilograms 
          of heroin smuggled to Australia aboard the North Korean-owned 
          vessel ``Pong Su'' is the latest and largest seizure of heroin 
          pointing to North Korean complicity in the drug trade. 
          Although there is no evidence that narcotics originating in or 
          transiting North Korea reach the United States, the United 
          States is intensifying its effort to stop North Korean 
          involvement in illicit narcotics production and trafficking 
          and to enhance law-enforcement cooperation with affected 
          countries in the region to achieve that objective.
          You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report 
          under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, 
          and publish it in the Federal Register.

Statement of Explanation

Burma

          The United States has determined that Burma failed 
          demonstrably to make sufficient efforts during the last 12 
          months to meet its obligations under international 
          counternarcotics agreements and the counternarcotics 
          requirements set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the Foreign 
          Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.
          Burma remains among the world's largest producers and 
          traffickers of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), and the 
          world's second largest producer of illicit opium. Although 
          precise figures are hard to come by, production and 
          trafficking of methamphetamine from Burma continues to be one 
          of the most serious problems facing Southeast Asia. 
          Neighboring countries seized tens of millions of ATS tablets 
          produced in Burma with precursor chemicals imported from other 
          countries, and the explosion of synthetic drugs remained a 
          major threat to national security and public health throughout 
          the region.
          The Government of Burma did little to hinder activities of 
          drug gangs that operate freely along its borders with China, 
          Thailand and Laos. Burma also failed to restrict involvement 
          in illicit narcotics by the largest, most powerful, and most 
          important trafficking organization in Burma, the United Wa 
          State Army (UWSA). Major UWSA traffickers continue to operate 
          with apparent impunity in areas outside government control, 
          and UWSA involvement in methamphetamine production and 
          trafficking remains a serious concern.
          Implementation of money laundering legislation, enacted in 
          2002, faltered in 2003. Despite opening a few cases, the 
          Government of Burma has undertaken no prosecutions, and a 
          February banking crisis appeared to have halted further 
          efforts to implement the law. Burma continued to permit UWSA 
          and other trafficking organizations to own commercial banks 
          and invest in other economic activities.
          While the magnitude of the above issues resulted in a 
          determination not to certify, Burma's counternarcotics 
          performance over the past 12 months registered some positive 
          aspects. Although Burma remains the world's second largest 
          producer of illicit opium, opium cultivation declined a 
          further 24 percent, according to the U.N. Office of Drugs and 
          Crime. While the return of good weather brought much higher 
          yields, overall production still declined for the sixth 
          consecutive year.
          The Government of Burma cooperated with regional and 
          international counternarcotics agencies and organizations, 
          resulting in several cases against traffickers and their 
          organizations in cooperation with the United States, 
          Australia, Thailand, China, and others. Burma also signed 
          agreements in 2003 with China and India on the control of 
          precursor chemicals.
          We urge the Government of Burma to address those areas where 
          its efforts have fallen far short, and to treat its 
          counternarcotics obligations with the utmost seriousness.

Statement of Explanation

Haiti

          The United States has determined that Haiti has failed 
          demonstrably to make sufficient efforts during the last 12 
          months on counternarcotics issues, including its obligations 
          under international counternarcotics agreements and 
          counternarcotics requirements set forth in section 489(a)(1) 
          of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended). Haiti 
          remains a transshipment point for drugs moving towards the 
          United States, and the Government of Haiti (GOH) has done 
          little to cooperate with the United States to interdict the 
          flow of drugs destined for the United States or to honor its 
          commitments as a party to the 1988 U.N. Drug Convention.
          With the notable and praiseworthy exceptions of expelling 
          notorious drug trafficker Jacques Ketant, establishing a 
          trusted unit of anti-drug agents, and increasing the number of 
          anti-drug police including coast guardsmen, the GOH has not 
          met all of the objectives or obtained the results laid out by 
          the United States Government in its demarche to the GOH this 
          past year.
          The GOH did not: 1) deposit an instrument of ratification of 
          the OAS anti-corruption convention; 2) draft and introduce 
          anti-corruption legislation; 3) enforce existing anti-money-
          laundering legislation; 4) increase budgetary support for the 
          Haitian Coast Guard; 5) ensure that asset forfeiture is an 
          integral part of criminal prosecutions; 6) provide 
          comprehensive training to judges, prosecutors and law 
          enforcement personnel; 7) waive the right to exercise 
          prosecutorial jurisdiction in cases of non-Haitian vessels 
          interdicted by U.S. Coast Guard, and authorize enforcement of 
          U.S. law against the vessels, cargo and persons on board; or 
          8) ratify the 1971 U.N. Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
          While Haiti has demonstrably failed, according to the 
          President's standards for counternarcotics performance, the 
          U.S. vital national interests require that U.S. assistance to 
          Haiti continue. As the hemisphere's poorest country, Haiti has 
          a continued need for assistance to programs that increase 
          access to education, combat environmental degradation, fight 
          the spread of HIV/AIDS, reduce trafficking of women and 
          children, and foster the creation of legitimate business and 
          employment opportunities. In the long term, these programs can 
          contribute to democratic development in Haiti and a reduction 
          in illegal migration. Continuing these types of programs will 
          also address the root causes of poverty and hopelessness, 
          factors that contribute to Haitian involvement in the 
          international drug trade. Suspension of assistance to Haiti 
          could hamper U.S. efforts to ensure implementation of OAS 
          Resolution 822, which commits the Government of Haiti to a 
          series of actions that would promote a climate of security and 
          confidence for free and fair legislative elections to be held 
          in 2003.

Presidential Determination No. 2003-39 of September 16, 2003

Classified Information Concerning the Air Force's Operating Location Near 
Groom Lake, Nevada

Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
[and] the Secretary of the Air Force

          I find that it is in the paramount interest of the United 
          States to exempt the United States Air Force's operating 
          location near Groom Lake, Nevada, the subject of litigation in 
          Kasza v. Browner (D. Nev. CV	S	94	795	PMP) and Frost v. Perry 
          (D. Nev. CV	S	94	714	PMP), from any applicable requirement for 
          the disclosure to unauthorized persons of classified 
          information concerning that operating location. Therefore, 
          pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6961(a), I hereby exempt the Air Force's 
          operating location near Groom Lake, Nevada, from any Federal, 
          State, interstate or local provision respecting control and 
          abatement of solid waste or hazardous waste disposal that 
          would require the disclosure of classified information 
          concerning the operating location to any unauthorized person. 
          This exemption shall be effective for the full one-year 
          statutory period.
          Nothing herein is intended to: (a) imply that in the absence 
          of such a Presidential exemption, the Resource Conservation 
          and Recovery Act (RCRA) or any other provision of law permits 
          or requires disclosure of classified information to 
          unauthorized persons; or (b) limit the applicability or 
          enforcement of any requirement of law applicable to the Air 
          Force's operating location near Groom Lake, Nevada, except 
          those provisions, if any, that would require the disclosure of 
          classified information.
          The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized and directed to 
          publish this determination in the Federal Register.

Notice of September 18, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to

Persons Who Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support

Terrorism

          On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, I declared a 
          national emergency with respect to persons who commit, 
          threaten to commit, or support terrorism, pursuant to the 
          International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701	
          1706). I took this action to deal with the unusual and 
          extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, 
          and economy of the United States constituted by the grave acts 
          of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign 
          terrorists, including the terrorist attacks in New York, 
          Pennsylvania, and on the Pentagon committed on September 11, 
          2001, and the continuing and immediate threat of further 
          attacks on United States nationals or the United States. 
          Because the actions of these persons who commit, threaten to 
          commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and 
          extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, 
          and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
          declared on September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on 
          that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect 
          beyond September 23, 2003. Therefore, consistent with section 
          202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I 
          am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect 
          to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support 
          terrorism.
          This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
          transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of October 16, 2003

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to

Significant Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia

          On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President 
          declared a national emergency consistent with to the 
          International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701	
          1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
          national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
          States constituted by the actions of significant narcotics 
          traffickers centered in Colombia, and the extreme level of 
          violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the 
          United States and abroad.
          The order blocks all property and interests in property that 
          are in the United States or within the possession or control 
          of United States persons or foreign persons listed in an annex 
          to the order, as well as of foreign persons determined to play 
          a significant role in international narcotics trafficking 
          centered in Colombia. The order similarly blocks all property 
          and interests in property of foreign persons determined to 
          materially assist in, or provide financial or technological 
          support for or goods or services in support of, the narcotics 
          trafficking activities of persons designated in or pursuant to 
          the order, or persons determined to be owned or controlled by, 
          or to act for or on behalf of, persons designated in or 
          pursuant to the order. The order also prohibits any 
          transaction or dealing by United States persons or within the 
          United States in such property or interests in property.
          Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers 
          centered in Colombia continue to threaten the national 
          security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States and 
          to cause an extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm in 
          the United States and abroad, the national emergency declared 
          on October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto 
          to deal

[[Page 345]]

          with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 
          21, 2003. Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of the 
          National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing 
          for 1 year the national emergency with respect to significant 
          narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. This notice shall 
          be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the 
          Congress.

          Protection Act of 2002 (Public Law 107	206; 22 U.S.C. 7421 et

          Forces of the United States in certain United Nations 
          peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, I hereby 
          certify that members of the U.S. Armed Forces participating in 
          the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) are without risk 
          of criminal prosecution or other assertion of jurisdiction by 
          the International Criminal Court because, in authorizing the 
          operation, the United Nations Security Council (in Resolutions 
          1497 (2003) and 1509 (2003)) has provided for the exclusive 
          jurisdiction of the contributing State for all acts or 
          omissions arising out of or related to UNMIL, unless such 
          exclusive jurisdiction is expressly waived.

Presidential Determination No. 2004-06 of October 21, 2003

Presidential Determination on FY 2004 Refugee Admissions Numbers and 
Authorizations of In-Country Refugee Status Consistent with Sections 207 
and 101(a)(42), respectively, of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and 
Determination Consistent with Section 2 (b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Act, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

          Consistent with section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality 
          Act (the ``Act'') (8 U.S.C. 1157), as amended, and after 
          appropriate consultations with the Congress, I hereby make the 
          following determinations and authorize the following actions:

The admission of up to 70,000 refugees to the United States during FY 2004 
is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national 
interest; provided, however, that this number shall be understood as 
including persons admitted to the United States during FY 2004 with Federal 
refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian immigrant admissions 
program, as provided below.

          The 70,000 admissions numbers shall be allocated among 
          refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States 
          in accordance with the following regional allocations; 
          provided, however, that the number allocated to the East Asia 
          region shall include persons admitted to the United States 
          during FY 2004 with Federal refugee resettlement assistance 
          under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, 
          and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988, as contained 
          in section 101(e) of Public Law 100	202 (Amerasian immigrants 
          and their family members); provided further that the number 
          allocated to the former Soviet Union shall include persons 
          admitted who were nationals of the former Soviet Union, or in 
          the case of persons having no nationality, who were habitual 
          residents of the former Soviet Union, prior to September 2, 
          1991:

 
 
 
Africa...................................  25,000
East Asia................................  6,500
Europe and Central Asia..................  13,000
Latin America/Caribbean..................  3,500
Near East/South Asia.....................  2,000
Unallocated Reserve......................  20,000
 

          The 20,000 unallocated refugee numbers shall be allocated to 
          regional ceilings as needed. Upon providing notification to 
          the Judiciary Committees of the Congress, you are hereby 
          authorized to use unallocated numbers in regions where the 
          need for additional numbers arises.

[[Page 347]]

          Additionally, upon notification to the Judiciary Committees of 
          the Congress, you are further authorized to transfer unused 
          admission numbers allocated to a particular region to one or 
          more other regions, if there is a need for greater numbers for 
          the region or regions to which the numbers are being 
          transferred. Consistent with section 2(b)(2) of the Migration 
          and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, I hereby 
          determine that assistance to or on behalf of persons applying 
          for admission to the United States as part of the overseas 
          refugee admissions program will contribute to the foreign 
          policy interests of the United States and designate such 
          persons for this purpose.
          An additional 10,000 refugee admissions numbers shall be made 
          available during FY 2004 for the adjustment to permanent 
          resident status under section 209(b) of the Immigration and 
          Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1159(b)) of aliens who have been 
          granted asylum in the United States under section 208 of the 
          Act (8 U.S.C. 1158), as this is justified by humanitarian 
          concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.
          Consistent with section 101(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 
          1101(a)(42)) and after appropriate consultation with the 
          Congress, I also specify that, for FY 2004, the following 
          persons may, if otherwise qualified, be considered refugees 
          for the purpose of admission to the United States within their 
          countries of nationality or habitual residence:

  a. Persons in Vietnam

  b. Persons in Cuba

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass

Destruction

          On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, President 
          Clinton declared a national emergency with respect to the 
          unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
          foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the 
          proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons 
          (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such 
          weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive 
          Order 13094 to amend Executive Order 12938 to respond more 
          effectively to the worldwide threat of proliferation of 
          weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering such 
          weapons. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass 
          destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose 
          an unusual

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

          On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President 
          declared a national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to 
          the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.

          to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the

or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may

on the basis of handicap--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to

29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec.  102.141-102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec.  102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec.  102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec.  102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec.  102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 365]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec.  102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec.  102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec.  102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

Sec.  102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec.  102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

Executive Office of the President, shall be responsible for coordinating 
implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to the Director 
at the following address: Room 486, Old Executive Office Building, 17th 
and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.

[[Page 367]]

    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec.  102.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
