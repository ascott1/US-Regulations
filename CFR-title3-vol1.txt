          The seal of the National Archives and Records Administration 
              (NARA) authenticates the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as 
              the official codification of Federal regulations established 
              under the Federal Register Act. Under the provisions of 44 
              U.S.C. 1507, the contents of the CFR, a special edition of the 
              Federal Register, shall be judicially noticed. The CFR is 
              prima facie evidence of the original documents published in 
              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and 
              1017.

Beginning with 1976, Title 3 compilations also include regulations
  contained in Chapter I, Executive Office of the President.
Supplementary publications include: Presidential documents of the Hoover
  Administration (two volumes), Proclamations 1870-2037 and Executive
  Orders 5076-6070; Consolidated Indexes for 1936-1965; and Consolidated
  Tables for 1936-1965.

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2010), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request. Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB 
control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These 
OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable 
recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2009 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2009 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 8335 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2009 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2010, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
  statements, can be found in the Compilation of Presidential Documents 
   and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. A selection of these 
Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
 Division under the supervision of Stacey A. Mulligan. The Chief Editor 
                        for the 2009 Compilation was Michael J. Forcina.

Proclamation 8335 of January 6, 2009

Establishment of the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Over approximately 480 nautical miles, the Mariana Archipelago 
encompasses the 14 islands of the United States Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands and the United States Territory of Guam that 
sit atop the Mariana Ridge in an area known as the Mariana Volcanic Arc. 
The Mariana Volcanic Arc is part of a subduction system in which the 
Pacific Plate plunges beneath the Philippine Sea Plate and into the 
Earth's mantle, creating the Mariana Trench. Six of the archipelago's 
islands have been volcanically active in historic times, and numerous 
seamounts along the Mariana Ridge are volcanically or hydrothermically 
active. The Mariana Trench is approximately 940 nautical miles long and 
38 nautical miles wide within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone 
and contains the deepest known points in the global ocean.
The Mariana Volcanic Arc contains objects of scientific interest, 
including the largest active mud volcanoes on Earth. The Champagne vent, 
located at the Eifuku submarine volcano, produces almost pure liquid 
carbon dioxide. This phenomenon has only been observed at one other site 
in the world. The Sulfur Cauldron, a pool of liquid sulfur, is found at 
the Daikoku submarine volcano. The only other known location of molten 
sulfur is on Io, a moon of Jupiter. Unlike other reefs across the 
Pacific, the northernmost Mariana reefs provide unique volcanic habitats 
that support marine biological communities requiring basalt. Maug Crater 
represents one of only a handful of places on Earth where photosynthetic 
and chemosynthetic communities of life are known to come together.
The waters of the archipelago's northern islands are among the most 
biologically diverse in the Western Pacific and include the greatest 
diversity of seamount and hydrothermal vent life yet discovered. These 
volcanic islands are ringed by coral ecosystems with very high numbers 
of apex predators, including large numbers of sharks. They also contain 
one of the most diverse collections of stony corals in the Western 
Pacific. The northern islands and shoals in the archipelago have 
substantially higher large fish biomass, including apex predators, than 
the southern islands and Guam. The waters of Farallon de Pajaros (also 
known as Uracas), Maug, and Asuncion support some of the largest biomass 
of reef fishes in the Mariana Archipelago. These relatively pristine 
coral reef ecosystems are objects of scientific interest and essential 
to the long-term study of tropical marine ecosystems.
WHEREAS the submerged volcanic areas of the Mariana Ridge, the coral 
reef ecosystems of the waters surrounding the islands of Farallon de 
Pajaros, Maug, and Asuncion in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
Islands, and the Mariana Trench contain objects of scientific interest 
that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Government of 
the United States;
WHEREAS the United States continues to act in accordance with the 
balance of interests relating to traditional uses of the oceans 
recognizing freedom of navigation and overflight and other 
internationally recognized lawful uses of the sea;
WHEREAS the islands, waters, and airspace of the Mariana Ridge are of 
particular importance to the national security of the United States;
WHEREAS section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act'') authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by 
the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
WHEREAS it is in the public interest to preserve the known volcanic 
areas of the Mariana Ridge, the marine environment around the islands of 
Farallon de Pajaros, Maug, and Asuncion in the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, and the Mariana Trench for the care and 
management of the scientific objects therein:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Antiquities 
Act do proclaim that there are hereby set apart and reserved as the 
Marianas Trench Marine National Monument (the ``monument'' or ``marine 
national monument'') for the purpose of protecting the objects 
identified above, all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled 
by the Government of the United States within the boundaries described 
below and depicted on the accompanying map entitled ``Marianas Trench 
Marine National Monument'' attached to and forming a part of this 
proclamation. The monument includes the waters and submerged lands of 
the three northernmost Mariana Islands (the ``Islands Unit'') and only 
the submerged lands of designated volcanic sites (the ``Volcanic Unit'') 
and the Mariana Trench (the ``Trench Unit'') to the extent described as 
follows: The seaward boundaries of the Islands Unit of the monument 
extend to the lines of latitude and longitude depicted on the 
accompanying map, which lie approximately 50 nautical miles from the 
mean low water line of Farallon de Pajaros (Uracas), Maug, and Asuncion. 
The inland boundary of the Islands Unit of the monument is the mean low 
water line. The boundary of the Trench Unit of the monument extends from 
the northern limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States 
in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to the southern 
limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States in Guam 
approximately following the points of latitude and longitude identified 
on the accompanying map. The boundaries of the Volcanic Unit of the 
monument include a circle drawn with a 1 nautical mile radius centered 
on each of the volcanic features identified on the accompanying map and 
its legend. The Federal land and interests in land reserved consists of 
approximately 95,216 square miles of submerged lands and waters of the 
Mariana Archipelago, which is the smallest area compatible with the 
proper care and management of the objects to be protected.
Submerged lands that by legislation are subsequently granted by the 
United States to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands but 
remain controlled by the United States under the Antiquities Act may 
remain part of the monument, for coordination of management with the 
Government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Any 
submerged lands and interests in submerged lands within the monument not 
owned or controlled by the United States shall be reserved as a part of 
the monument upon acquisition of title or control by the United States.

Proclamation 8336 of January 6, 2009

Establishment of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Pacific Remote Islands area consists of Wake, Baker, Howland, and 
Jarvis Islands, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, and Palmyra Atoll, which 
lie to the south and west of Hawaii. With the exception of Wake Island, 
these islands are administered as National Wildlife Refuges by the 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the 
Interior. These refuges are an important part of the most widespread 
collection of marine- and terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet 
under a single country's jurisdiction. They sustain many endemic species 
including corals, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds, water 
birds, land birds, insects, and vegetation not found elsewhere.
Wake Island, to the west of Honolulu, Hawaii, is the northernmost atoll 
in the Marshall Islands geological ridge and perhaps the oldest living 
atoll in the world. Though it was substantially modified by the United 
States to create a military base before and after World War II, its 
major habitats are the three low coral islands consisting of shells, 
coral skeletons, and sand, supporting atoll vegetation adapted to arid 
climate. Wake Island supports 12 species of resident nesting seabirds 
and 6 species of migratory shorebirds, including 2 species of 
tropicbirds, 3 species of boobies, Great Frigatebird, Sooty Tern, Brown 
Noddy, and Wedge-tailed Shearwater. Black-footed Albatross and Laysan 
Albatross recently recolonized Wake Island, making it one of the few 
northern albatross colonies outside the Hawaiian archipelago.
Shallow coral reefs thrive around the perimeter of Wake Island. Fish 
populations are abundant and support at least 323 species, including 
large populations of the Napoleon wrasse (Chelinus), sharks of several 
species, and large schools of the Bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometapon), 
all of which are globally depleted. Beyond the shallow reefs, the outer 
reef slope descends sharply to great depths.
Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands were first formed as fringing reefs 
around islands formed by Cretaceous-era volcanoes (approximately 120-75 
million years ago). As the volcanoes subsided, the coral reefs grew 
upward, maintaining proximity to the sea surface. These low coral 
islands consist of coral rock, shells, and sand that support trees, 
shrubs, and grasses adapted to the arid climate at the equator. All 
three are surrounded by shallow coral reefs to depths of 100 meters, 
below which the reef slope descends steeply to great depths. Deep coral 
forests occur below photic zones of all three islands at depths below 
200 meters, especially at Jarvis where surveys have revealed living 
colonies of precious and ancient gold coral up to 5,000 years old.
The waters surrounding Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands have fish 
biomass double that of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, 
and 16 times that of the main Hawaiian Islands, due to the Equatorial 
Undercurrent that moves from west to east along the equator, creating 
localized nutrient-rich upwellings in shallows next to the islands. 
These are three of only six islands in the entire Pacific Ocean where 
this phenomenon is possible. These islands are high in coral cover and 
biodiversity and are predator-dominated systems. Their biomass of top 
predators exceeds that of the Great Barrier Reef or Kenyan Marine 
Protected Areas. The islands now host about a dozen nesting bird species 
including several nesting and migratory bird species that are of 
conservation significance. Jarvis alone has nearly 3 million pairs of 
Sooty Terns. There are about 300 fish species found off the islands. 
Giant clams (Tridacna), Napoleon wrasses, and Bumphead parrotfish are 
common, and sharks of many species are especially abundant at Jarvis and 
commonly larger there than elsewhere. Endangered hawksbill turtle and 
threatened green turtles forage in nearshore waters. All three islands 
afford unique opportunities to conduct climate change research at the 
equator, far from population centers. The coral skeletons there have 
recorded the earth's climatic history for many millions of years.
Johnston Atoll, the northernmost island in the island chain, is an 
ancient atoll and probably one of the oldest in the Pacific Ocean. 
Unlike most atolls, it does not have a surrounding barrier reef but has 
a semicircular emergent reef around the north and western margins of the 
island. Four major habitats characterize Johnston: low-lying islets 
consisting of the remains of corals and shells, shallow coral reefs to 
depths of 150 meters, deeper reefs to depths of 1,000 meters or more, 
and the slope of the ancient volcano on which the island rests.
Johnston is a genetic and larval stepping stone from the Remote Islands 
to the Hawaiian Islands for invertebrates, other reef fauna, corals, and 
dolphins. Despite its isolation, Johnston supports thriving communities 
of Table corals (Acropora) and a total of 45 coral species, including a 
dozen species confined to the Hawaiian and northern Line Islands. Some 
300 species of reef fish are at Johnston, including the endemic 
Nahacky's pygmy angelfish. Many threatened, endangered, and depleted 
species thrive there, including the green turtle, hawksbill turtle, 
pearl oyster, giant clams, reef sharks, groupers, humphead wrasse, 
bumphead parrotfish, whales, and dolphins. Endangered Hawaiian Monk 
Seals occasionally visit the atoll. Deep diving submersible surveys have 
revealed that Johnston supports the deepest reef building corals 
(Leptoseris) on record and large populations of hydrozoan corals 
(Millepora, Distichopora, Staylaster). Land areas support large 
populations of migratory shorebirds and resident seabird species, 
including populations of regional, national, or international 
significance: Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, Christmas Shearwaters, Red-
tailed Tropicbirds, Brown Boobies, Great Frigatebirds, Gray-backed 
Terns, and White Terns. Approximately 200 threatened Green turtles 
forage at Johnston. The surrounding waters are used by six depleted or 
endangered listed cetacean species: Sperm, Blue, Sei, Humpback, and 
North Pacific Right whales. Spinner dolphins are abundant, and 
endangered Humpback whales may calve there.
Palmyra Atoll is a classic Darwinian atoll that formed atop a sinking 
Cretaceous-era volcano. Kingman Reef formed in the same manner but is 
considered an atoll reef because it lacks permanent fast land areas or 
islands. Kingman Reef contains a sheltered lagoon that served as a way 
station for flying boats on Hawaii-to-American Samoa flights during the 
late 1930s. There are no terrestrial plants on the reef, which is 
frequently awash, but it does support abundant and diverse marine fauna 
and flora. Palmyra Atoll is managed by the United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service as a wildlife refuge. In 2001, the Secretary of the 
Interior established National Wildlife Refuges at Palmyra Atoll and 
Kingman Reef.
Palmyra Atoll and Kingman Reef are known to be among the most pristine 
coral reefs in the world, with a fully structured inverted food web. 
Kingman Reef is the most pristine of any reef under U.S. jurisdiction. 
They are ideal laboratories for assessing effects of climate change 
without the difficulty of filtering anthropogenic impacts. Both Palmyra 
Atoll and Kingman Reef support higher levels of coral and other 
cnidarian species diversity (180-190 species) than any other atoll or 
reef island in the central Pacific, twice as many as are found in Hawaii 
or Florida. Palmyra atoll has one of the best remaining examples of 
Pisonia grandis forest found in the Pacific region. This forest type has 
been lost or severely degraded over much of its range due to increased 
human population and development. Fish species diversity at Palmyra (418 
species) is higher than, while that of Kingman (297 species) is 
comparable to, that of the other remote Pacific refuges. Many 
threatened, endangered, and depleted species thrive there, including the 
green and hawksbill turtle, pearl oyster, giant clams (the highest 
concentration in the Pacific Remote Island Area), reef sharks, Coconut 
crabs, groupers, humphead and Napoleon wrasse, bumphead parrotfish, and 
dolphins. Significant numbers of threatened green turtles forage at both 
atolls, especially at Palmyra; endangered Hawksbill sea turtles forage 
at both atolls. Large schools of rare Melon-headed whales reside off 
both atolls. A possibly new species of beaked whale was recently 
described from 2 specimens stranded at Palmyra and 1 at Christmas 
Island. Palmyra supports 11 nesting seabird species including the third-
largest Red-footed Booby colony in the world. Large numbers of Bristle-
thighed Curlews, a migratory shorebird of conservation significance, 
winter at Palmyra.
WHEREAS Wake, Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands, Johnston Atoll, 
Kingman Reef, and Palmyra Atoll and their surrounding waters contain 
objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon lands 
owned or controlled by the Government of the United States;
WHEREAS the Department of Defense has historically maintained 
facilities, defensive areas, and airspace reservations at Wake Island 
and Johnston Atoll;
WHEREAS the United States continues to act in accordance with the 
balance of interests relating to traditional uses of the oceans 
recognizing freedom of navigation and overflight and other 
internationally recognized lawful uses of the sea;
WHEREAS section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act'') authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by 
the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
WHEREAS it is in the public interest to preserve the marine environment 
around the islands of Wake, Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands, Johnston 
Atoll, Kingman Reef, and Palmyra Atoll for the care and management of

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Antiquities 
Act, do proclaim that there are hereby set apart and reserved as the 
Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument (the ``monument'' or 
``marine national monument'') for the purpose of protecting the objects 
identified above, all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled 
by the Government of the United States within the boundaries described 
below and depicted on the accompanying maps entitled ``Pacific Remote 
Islands Marine National Monument'' attached to and forming a part of 
this proclamation. The monument includes the waters and submerged and 
emergent lands of the Pacific Remote Islands to the lines of latitude 
and longitude depicted on the accompanying maps, which lie approximately 
50 nautical miles from the mean low water lines of Wake, Baker, Howland, 
and Jarvis Islands, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, and Palmyra Atoll. The 
Federal land and interests in land reserved consists of approximately 
86,888 square miles, which is the smallest area compatible with the 
proper care and management of the objects to be protected.

Proclamation 8337 of January 6, 2009

Establishment of the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the Pacific Ocean approximately 130 nautical miles east-southeast of 
Pago Pago Harbor, American Samoa, lies Rose Atoll--the easternmost 
Samoan island and the southernmost point of the United States. This 
small atoll, which includes the Rose Atoll National Wildlife Refuge with 
about 20 acres of land and 1,600 acres of lagoon, remains one of the 
most pristine atolls in the world. The lands, submerged lands, waters, 
and marine environment around Rose Atoll support a dynamic reef 
ecosystem that is home to a very diverse assemblage of terrestrial and 
marine species, many of which are threatened or endangered.
One of the most striking features of Rose Atoll is the pink hue of 
fringing reef caused by the dominance of coralline algae, which is the 
primary reef-building species. Though there are roughly 100 species of 
stony corals, the shallow reefs are dominated by crustose coralline 
algae, making them distinctive and quite different from those found at 
other Samoan islands. The marine area provides isolated, unmolested 
nesting grounds for green and hawksbill turtles and has the largest 
number of nesting turtles in American Samoa. Its waters are frequented 
by numerous large predators: whitetip reef sharks, blacktip reef sharks, 
gray reef sharks, snappers, jacks, groupers, and barracudas. Species 
that have faced depletion elsewhere, some of which have declined 
worldwide by as much as 98 percent, are found in abundance at Rose 
Atoll, including giant clams, Maori wrasse, large parrotfishes, and 
blacktip, whitetip, and gray reef sharks. Humpback whales, pilot whales, 
and the porpoise genus Stenella have all been spotted at Rose Atoll. 
There are 272 species of reef fish, with seven species first described 
by scientists at Rose and dozens more new species discovered on the 
first deep water dive to 200 meters. Recent submersible dives around 
Rose Atoll have revealed abundant marine life, deep sea coral forests, 
and several new fish and invertebrate species.
Rose Atoll supports most of the seabird population of American Samoa, 
including 12 federally protected migratory seabirds, five species of 
federally protected shorebirds, and a migrant forest bird, the long-
tailed cuckoo. Rare species of nesting petrels, shearwaters, and terns 
are thriving at Rose Atoll and increasing in number. The atoll is known 
to Samoans, who have periodically visited over the past millennium, as 
``Nu'u O Manu'' (``Village of seabirds''). It is believed that 
Polynesians have harvested at Rose Atoll for millennia and several 
species, such as the giant clam, were used for cultural celebrations and 
events. Few relatively undisturbed islands remain in the world and Rose 
Atoll is one of the last remaining refuges for the seabird and turtle 
species of the Central Pacific. Threatened Pisonia atoll forest trees 
are also found at Rose Atoll.
WHEREAS the lands, submerged lands, and waters of and marine environment 
around Rose Atoll contain objects of historic or scientific interest 
that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Government of 
the United States;
WHEREAS the United States continues to act in accordance with the 
balance of interests relating to traditional uses of the oceans 
recognizing freedom of navigation and overflight and other 
internationally recognized lawful uses of the sea;
WHEREAS section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act'') authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by 
the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
WHEREAS it is in the public interest to preserve the lands, submerged 
lands and waters of, and marine environment around Rose Atoll as 
necessary for the care and management of the historic and scientific 
objects therein:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Antiquities 
Act, do proclaim that there are hereby set apart and reserved as the 
Rose Atoll Marine National Monument (the ``monument'' or ``marine 
national monument'') for the purpose of protecting the objects described 
in the above preceding paragraphs, all lands and interests in lands 
owned or controlled by the Government of the United States within the 
boundaries that lie approximately 50 nautical miles from the mean low 
water line of Rose Atoll as depicted on the accompanying map entitled 
``Rose Atoll Marine National Monument'' attached to and forming a part 
of this proclamation. The Federal land and interests in land reserved 
consists of approximately 13,451 square miles of emergent and submerged 
lands and waters of and around Rose Atoll in American Samoa, which is 
the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the 
objects to be protected.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of this 
monument are hereby withdrawn from all forms of entry, location, 
selection, sale, or leasing or other disposition under the public land 
laws to the extent that those laws apply.
Management of the Marine National Monument 
The Secretary of the Interior shall have management responsibility for 
the monument, including Rose Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, except that the Secretary

regarding the management of the marine areas of the monument seaward of 
mean low water, with respect to fishery-related activities regulated 
pursuant to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), and any other applicable authorities. The 
Secretary of Commerce shall initiate the process to add the marine areas 
of the monument to the Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 
accordance with the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 et 
seq.), including its provision for consultation with an advisory 
council, to further the protection of the objects identified in this 
proclamation. In developing and implementing any management
      
plans and any management rules and regulations, the Secretary of 
Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior and shall 
designate and involve as cooperating agencies the agencies with

Proclamation 8338 of January 13, 2009

Religious Freedom Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Religious freedom is the foundation of a healthy and hopeful society. On 
Religious Freedom Day, we recognize the importance of the 1786 passage 
of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. We also celebrate the 
first liberties enshrined in our Constitution's Bill of Rights, which 
guarantee the free exercise of religion for all Americans and prohibit 
an establishment of religion.
Our Nation was founded by people seeking haven from religious 
persecution, and the religious liberty they found here remains one of 
this land's greatest blessings. As Americans, we believe that all people 
have inherent dignity and worth. Though we may profess different creeds 
and worship in different manners and places, we respect each other's 
humanity and expression of faith. People with diverse views can practice 
their faiths here while living together in peace and harmony, carrying 
on our Nation's noble tradition of religious freedom.
The United States also stands with religious dissidents and believers 
from around the globe who practice their faith peacefully. Freedom is 
not a grant of government or a right for Americans alone; it is the 
birthright of every man, woman, and child throughout the world. No human 
freedom is more fundamental than the right to worship in accordance with 
one's conscience.
Religious Freedom Day is an opportunity to celebrate our legacy of 
religious liberty, foster a culture of tolerance and peace, and renew 
commitments to ensure that every person on Earth can enjoy these basic 
human rights.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2009, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to reflect on the great 
blessing of religious liberty, endeavor to preserve this freedom for 
future generations, and commemorate this day with appropriate events and 
activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8339 of January 15, 2009

National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

All human life is a gift from our Creator that is sacred, unique, and 
worthy of protection. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, our 
country recognizes that each person, including every person waiting to 
be born, has a special place and purpose in this world. We also 
underscore our dedication to heeding this message of conscience by 
speaking up for the weak and voiceless among us.
The most basic duty of government is to protect the life of the 
innocent. My Administration has been committed to building a culture of 
life by vigorously promoting adoption and parental notification laws, 
opposing Federal funding for abortions overseas, encouraging teen 
abstinence, and funding crisis pregnancy programs. In 2002, I was 
honored to sign into law the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, which 
extends legal protection to children who survive an abortion attempt. I 
signed legislation in 2003 to ban the cruel practice of partial-birth 
abortion, and that law represents our commitment to building a culture 
of life in America. Also, I was proud to sign the Unborn Victims of 
Violence Act of 2004, which allows authorities to charge a person who 
causes death or injury to a child in the womb with a separate offense in 
addition to any charges relating to the mother.
America is a caring Nation, and our values should guide us as we harness 
the gifts of science. In our zeal for new treatments and cures, we must 
never abandon our fundamental morals. We can achieve the great 
breakthroughs we all seek with reverence for the gift of life.
The sanctity of life is written in the hearts of all men and women. On 
this day and throughout the year, we aspire to build a society in which 
every child is welcome in life and protected in law. We also encourage 
more of our fellow Americans to join our just and noble cause. History 
tells us that with a cause rooted in our deepest principles and 
appealing to the best instincts of our citizens, we will prevail.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 18, 2009, as 
National Sanctity of Human Life Day. I call upon all Americans to 
recognize this day with appropriate ceremonies and to underscore our 
commitment to respecting and protecting the life and dignity of every 
human being.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8340 of January 15, 2009

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, we recognize one of 
history's most consequential advocates for equality and civil rights, 
and we celebrate his powerful message of justice and hope. Our Nation is 
better because Dr. King was a man of courage and vision who understood 
that love and compassion will always triumph over bitterness and hatred.
As Americans, we believe it is self-evident that all men are created 
equal and that freedom is not a grant of government but a gift from the 
Author of Life. Dr. King trusted in these beliefs articulated in our 
founding documents even when our country's practices did not live up to 
its promises. He roused the conscience of a complacent Nation by drawing 
attention to the ugliness of discrimination and segregation and by 
calling on Americans to live up to our guarantee of equality.
Our Nation has seen tremendous progress in redeeming the ideals of 
America and protecting every person's God-given rights. The historic 
election of Barack Obama as President of the United States reflects the 
real advances our Nation has made in the fight against the bigotry that 
Dr. King opposed. More work remains, though, and we must heed Dr. King's 
words that ``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' By 
continuing to spread his message and demanding that the equal rights he 
fought for are extended to all people, we can ensure that the dignity of 
every person is respected and that the hope for a better tomorrow 
reaches every community throughout the world.
As we observe Dr. King's birthday, we commemorate his leadership and 
strength of character. We go forward with confidence that if we remain 
true to our founding principles, our Nation will continue to advance the 
cause of justice and remain a beacon of hope to people everywhere.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 19, 2009, as the 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to 
observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service programs 
and activities in honor of Dr. King's life and legacy.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8341 of January 16, 2009

To Implement the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement and for 
Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On April 12, 2006, the United States entered into the United States-
Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (the ``Agreement''), and on June 24 and 
June 25, 2007, the Parties to the Agreement signed a protocol amending 
the Agreement. Congress approved the Agreement as amended in section 
101(a) of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``Implementation Act'') (Public Law 110-138, 121 
Stat. 1455) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note).
2. Section 105(a) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office that 
shall be responsible for providing administrative assistance to panels 
established under chapter 21 of the Agreement.
3. Section 201 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such 
continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional 
duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to 
carry out or apply Articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.3.13 and Annex 2.3 of the 
Agreement.
4. Section 201(d) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
take such action as may be necessary in implementing the tariff-rate 
quotas set forth in Appendix I to the Schedule of the United States to 
Annex 2.3 of the Agreement to ensure that imports of agricultural goods 
do not disrupt the orderly marketing of commodities in the United 
States.
5. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Implementation Act, Peru is 
to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing 
countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP) on the date the Agreement enters into force. Further, 
consistent with section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2483), I have determined that other technical 
and conforming changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) are necessary to reflect that Peru is no longer eligible to 
receive the benefits of the GSP.
6. Section 203 of the Implementation Act sets forth certain rules for 
determining whether a good is an originating good for the purpose of 
implementing preferential tariff treatment provided for under the 
Agreement. I have decided that it is necessary to include these rules of 
origin, together with particular rules applicable to certain other 
goods, in the HTS.
7. Section 203(o) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
determine that a fabric, yarn, or fiber is or is not available in 
commercial quantities in a timely manner in the United States and Peru; 
to establish procedures governing the request for any such determination 
and ensuring appropriate public participation in any such determination; 
to add any fabric, yarn, or fiber determined to be not available in 
commercial quantities in a timely manner in the United States and Peru 
to the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement in a restricted or 
unrestricted quantity; to eliminate a restriction on the quantity of a 
fabric, yarn, or fiber within 6 months after adding the fabric, yarn, or 
fiber to the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement in a restricted 
quantity; and to restrict the quantity of, or remove from the list in 
Annex 3-B of the Agreement, certain fabrics, yarns, or fibers.
8. Section 208 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
take certain enforcement actions relating to trade with Peru in textile 
and apparel goods.
9. Subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act authorizes the 
President to take certain actions in response to a request by an 
interested party for relief from serious damage or actual threat thereof 
to a domestic industry producing certain textile or apparel articles.
10. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established the 
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), 
consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, 
Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as 
Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. 
Consistent with section 301 of title 3, United States Code, when 
carrying out functions vested in the President by statute and assigned 
by the President to CITA, the officials collectively exercising those 
functions are all to be officers required to be appointed by the 
President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
11. Presidential Proclamation 7971 of December 22, 2005, implemented the 
United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (USMFTA). The proclamation 
implemented, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Morocco Free 
Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USMFTA Act'') (Public Law 108-
302, 118 Stat. 1103) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in 
rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry 
out or apply certain provisions of the USMFTA, including Articles 2.5 
and 2.6. The proclamation inadvertently omitted two modifications to the 
HTS necessary to carry out the provisions of Articles 2.5 and 2.6 of the 
USMFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are 
necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment under Articles 2.5 
and 2.6 of the USMFTA.
12. Presidential Proclamation 8039 of July 27, 2006, implemented the 
United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (USBFTA). The proclamation 
implemented, pursuant to section 201 of the United State-Bahrain Free 
Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USBFTA Act'') (Public Law 109-
169, 119 Stat. 3581), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I 
determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply certain 
provisions of the USBFTA, including Articles 2.5 and 2.6. The 
proclamation inadvertently omitted two modifications to the HTS 
necessary to carry out the provisions of Articles 2.5 and 2.6 of the 
USBFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are 
necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment under Articles 2.5 
and 2.6 of the USBFTA.
13. Presidential Proclamation 8331 of December 23, 2008, implemented the 
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
(CAFTA-DR) for trade with Costa Rica. The proclamation implemented, 
pursuant to section 201 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United 
States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``CAFTA-DR Act'') 
(Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 467) (19 U.S.C. 4031), the duty treatment 
necessary to carry out or apply Articles 3.3 and 3.27, and Annexes 3.3 
(including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to 
originating goods) and 3.27, of the CAFTA-DR. I have determined that 
technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide the intended 
duty treatment under the CAFTA-DR.
14. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended, authorizes the President to 
embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or 
other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, 
including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any 
rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 604 of the 1974 Act; sections 105(a), 201, 203, 208, and 
subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act; and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code, and having made the determination under 
section 101(b) of the Implementation Act necessary for the exchange of 
notes, do hereby proclaim: (1) In order to provide generally for the 
preferential tariff treatment being accorded under the Agreement, to set 
forth rules for determining whether goods imported into the customs 
territory of the United States are eligible for preferential tariff 
treatment under the Agreement, to provide certain other treatment to 
originating goods of Peru for the purposes of the Agreement, to provide 
tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain originating goods of Peru, to 
reflect Peru's removal from the enumeration of designated beneficiary 
developing countries for purposes of the GSP, and to make technical and 
conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified 
as set forth in Annex I of Publication 4058 of the United States 
International Trade Commission, entitled, ``Modifications to the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the United 
States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement'', which is incorporated by 
reference into this proclamation.
(2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty elimination provided 
for in the Agreement and to provide for future staged reductions in 
duties for originating goods of Peru for purposes of the Agreement, the 
HTS is modified as provided in Annex II of Publication 4058, effective 
on the dates specified in the relevant sections of such publication and 
on any subsequent dates set forth for such duty reductions in that 
publication.
(3) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates 
indicated in Annex II to Publication 4058.
(4) The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to exercise my authority 
under section 105(a) of the Implementation Act to establish or designate 
an office within the Department of Commerce to carry out the functions 
set forth in that section.
(5) The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is authorized to 
exercise my authority under section 201(d) of the Implementation Act to 
take such action as may be necessary in implementing the tariff-rate 
quotas set forth in Appendix I to the Schedule of the United States to 
Annex 2.3 of the Agreement to ensure that imports of agricultural goods 
do not disrupt the orderly marketing of commodities in the United 
States. This action is set forth in Annex I of Publication 4058.
(6) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 203(o) 
of the Implementation Act to determine that a fabric, yarn, or fiber is 
or is not available in commercial quantities in a timely manner in the 
United States and Peru; to establish procedures governing the request 
for any such determination and ensuring appropriate public participation 
in any such determination; to add any fabric, yarn, or fiber determined 
to be not available in commercial quantities in a timely manner in the 
United States and Peru to the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement in a 
restricted or unrestricted quantity; to eliminate a restriction on the 
quantity of a fabric, yarn, or fiber within 6 months after adding the 
fabric, yarn, or fiber to the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement in a 
restricted quantity; and to restrict the quantity of, or remove from the 
list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement, certain fabrics, yarns, or fibers.
(7) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 208 of 
the Implementation Act to exclude certain textile and apparel goods from 
the customs territory of the United States; to determine whether an 
enterprise's production of, and capability to produce, goods are 
consistent with statements by the enterprise; to find that an enterprise 
has knowingly or willfully engaged in circumvention; and to deny 
preferential tariff treatment to textile and apparel goods.
(8) The CITA is authorized to exercise the functions of the President 
under subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act to review 
requests, and to determine whether to commence consideration of such 
requests; to cause to be published in the Federal Register a notice of

Proclamation 8342 of January 16, 2009

To Suspend Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Foreign Government 
Officials Responsible for Failing To Combat Trafficking in Persons

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In order to foster greater resolve to address trafficking in persons 
(TIP), specifically in punishing acts of trafficking and providing 
protections to the victims of these crimes, consistent with the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, as amended (the ``Act'') (22 
U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), it is in the interests of the United States to 
restrict the international travel and to suspend entry into the United 
States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of certain senior government 
officials responsible for domestic law enforcement, justice, or labor 
affairs who have impeded their governments' antitrafficking efforts, 
have failed to implement their governments' antitrafficking laws and 
policies, or who otherwise bear responsibility for their governments' 
failures to take steps recognized internationally as appropriate to 
combat trafficking in persons, and whose governments have been ranked 
more than once as Tier 3 countries, which represent the worst anti-TIP 
performers, in the Department of State's annual Trafficking in Persons 
Report, and for which I have made a determination pursuant to section 
110(d)(1)-(2) or (4) of the Act. The Act reflects international 
antitrafficking standards that guide efforts to eradicate this modern-
day form of slavery around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including section 212(f) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), and section 
301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted 
immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons 
described in section 1 of this proclamation would, except as provided 
for in sections 2 and 3 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the 
interests of the United States.
I therefore hereby proclaim that:
Section 1. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or 
nonimmigrants, of the following aliens is hereby suspended:
 (a) Senior government officials--defined as the heads of ministries or 
agencies and officials occupying positions within the two bureaucratic 
levels below those top positions--responsible for domestic law 
enforcement, justice, or labor affairs who have impeded their 
governments' antitrafficking efforts, have failed to implement their 
governments' antitrafficking laws and policies, or who otherwise bear 
responsibility for their governments' failures to take steps recognized 
internationally as appropriate to combat trafficking in persons, and who 
are members of governments for which I have made a determination 
pursuant to section 110(d)(1)-(2) or (4) of the Act, in the current year 
and at least once in the preceding 3 years;
(b) The spouses of persons described in subsection (a) of this section.
Sec. 2. Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply with respect to 
any person otherwise covered by section 1 where entry of such person 
would not be contrary to the interest of the United States.
Sec. 3. Persons covered by sections 1 or 2 of this proclamation shall be 
identified by the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee, in his 
or her sole discretion, pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary may 
establish under section 5 of this proclamation.
Sec. 4. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to derogate from 
United States Government obligations under applicable international 
agreements.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of State shall implement this proclamation 
pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, may establish.
Sec. 6. This proclamation is effective immediately. It shall remain in 
effect until such time as the Secretary of State determines that it is 
no longer necessary and should be terminated, either in whole or in 
part. Any such determination by the Secretary of State shall be 
published in the Federal Register.
Sec. 7. This proclamation is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at 
law or in equity by any party against the United States, its 
departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or 
employees, or any other person.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8343 of January 20, 2009

National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As I take the sacred oath of the highest office in the land, I am 
humbled by the responsibility placed upon my shoulders, renewed by the 
courage and decency of the American people, and fortified by my faith in 
an awesome God.
We are in the midst of a season of trial. Our Nation is being tested, 
and our people know great uncertainty. Yet the story of America is one 
of renewal in the face of adversity, reconciliation in a time of 
discord, and we know that there is a purpose for everything under 
heaven.
On this Inauguration Day, we are reminded that we are heirs to over two 
centuries of American democracy, and that this legacy is not simply a 
birthright--it is a glorious burden. Now it falls to us to come together 
as a people to carry it forward once more.
So in the words of President Abraham Lincoln, let us remember that: 
``The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and 
patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad 
land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as 
surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 2009, a National Day 
of Renewal and Reconciliation, and call upon all of our citizens to 
serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this Nation for our 
new century.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8344 of February 2, 2009

American Heart Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Together, we can turn the tide on the number one killer of American 
women and men. Heart disease claims more lives each year than all forms 
of cancer combined. During American Heart Month, we renew our commitment 
to promoting heart disease awareness. It is never too late to start 
protecting heart health.
 Certain risk factors can lead to heart disease. These include: high 
blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, 
and diabetes. Practicing the following ``Big Four'' habits can help 
mitigate these risks: eating a heart healthy diet, getting regular 
physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding tobacco. 
Unfortunately, only 3 percent of U.S. adults practice all of these 
habits. As a Nation, we must work to increase that number.
 Forming these healthy habits does not have to be difficult: Setting 
realistic goals, making gradual improvements, and inviting family and 
friends to join in this pursuit can lead to a healthier lifestyle. Above 
all, we must remember that taking action can mean a longer, healthier, 
and more enjoyable life.
 Michelle and I especially encourage women to take heart health 
seriously. More women than men die of heart disease each year, and many 
women fail to make the connection between risk factors and their 
personal risk of developing heart disease. The Federal Government's The 
Heart Truth campaign gives women a personal and urgent wake-up call 
about their risk for heart disease. On the first Friday in February, The 
Heart Truth will lead the Nation in celebrating National Wear Red Day to 
promote heart disease awareness. All Americans are encouraged to wear 
red or the Red Dress Pin--the national symbol for women and heart 
disease awareness--to show support for adopting the Big Four heart 
health lifestyle habits. This year on National Wear Red Day, we urge all 
Americans to practice the ``Big Four'' healthy habits for reducing heart 
disease risk.
 During American Heart Month, we also honor the health professionals, 
researchers, and other heart health ambassadors whose efforts help all 
Americans lead longer and healthier lives.
 In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has 
requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating 
February as ``American Heart Month.''
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2009 as American Heart Month, and I 
invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 
6, 2009. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and 
reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8345 of February 2, 2009

National African American History Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 The history of African Americans is unique and rich, and one that has 
helped to define what it means to be an American. Arriving on ships on 
the shores of North America more than 300 years ago, recognized more as 
possessions than people, African Americans have come to know the 
freedoms fought for in establishing the United States and gained through 
the use of our founding principles of freedom of speech, freedom of the 
press, the right to assembly, and due process of law. The ideals of the 
Founders became more real and more true for every citizen as African 
Americans pressed us to realize our full potential as a Nation and to 
uphold those ideals for all who enter into our borders and embrace the 
notion that we are all endowed with certain unalienable rights.
 Since Carter G. Woodson first sought to illuminate the African American 
experience, each February we pause to reflect on the contributions of 
this community to our national identity. The history is one of struggle 
for the recognition of each person's humanity as well as an influence on 
the broader American culture. African Americans designed our beautiful 
Capital City, gave us the melodic rhythms of New Orleans Jazz, issued 
new discoveries in science and medicine, and forced us to examine 
ourselves in the pages of classic literature. This legacy has only added 
luster to the brand of the United States, which has drawn immigrants to 
our shores for centuries.
 This year's theme, ``The Quest for Black Citizenship in the Americas,'' 
is a chance to examine the evolution of our country and how African 
Americans helped draw us ever closer to becoming a more perfect union.
 The narrative of the African American pursuit of full citizenship with 
all of the rights and privileges afforded others in this country is also 
the story of a maturing young Nation. The voices and examples of the 
African American people worked collectively to remove the boulders of 
systemic racism and discrimination that pervaded our laws and our public 
consciousness for decades. Through the work of Frederick Douglass and 
Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver, 
Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall, the African American community 
has steadily made progress toward the dreams within its grasp and the 
promise of our Nation. Meanwhile, the belief that those dreams might one 
day be realized by all of our citizens gave African American men and 
women the same sense of duty and love of country that led them to shed 
blood in every war we have ever fought, to invest hard-earned resources 
in their communities with the hope of self empowerment, and to pass the 
ideals of this great land down to their children and grandchildren.
 As we mark National African American History Month, we should take note 
of this special moment in our Nation's history and the actors who worked 
so diligently to deliver us to this place. One such organization is the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People--the NAACP--
which this year will witness 100 years of service to the Nation on 
February 12. Because of their work, including the contributions of those 
luminaries on the front lines and great advocates behind the scenes, we 
as a Nation were able to take the dramatic steps we have in recent 
history.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2009 as 
National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs 
that raise awareness and appreciation of African American history.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8346 of February 27, 2009

American Red Cross Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Sixty-two years after its founding, the Red Cross was instrumental in 
what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the ``greatest single 
crusade of mercy in all of history.'' In 1943, at the height of World 
War II, President Roosevelt called on the American people to support the 
troops by supporting the Red Cross, which provided food, blood, and 
supplies to American troops, allies, and civilians across the world. 
President Roosevelt asked Americans to donate funds to the Red Cross, 
setting a goal of $125 million for 6 weeks of fundraising. The American 
people responded with characteristic generosity, opening their hearts 
and wallets. The Red Cross met this goal in less than 6 weeks. During 
that season of generosity and unity, President Roosevelt proclaimed 
March 1943 as the first Red Cross Month.
 The Red Cross has continued to serve those suffering from large- and 
small-scale disasters. The organization is best known for its work 
helping communities deal with major disasters such as hurricanes, 
floods, and wildfires. These large-scale disasters represent a major 
part of the work of the American Red Cross. Just as important are the 
tens of thousands of small-scale disasters that occur every day in 
communities nationwide, and the volunteers who respond to them. These 
efforts include supporting our military and their families, collecting 
and distributing blood, helping the needy, delivering health and safety 
education, and providing aid abroad.
 In every response, volunteers are the key to Red Cross efforts. 
Volunteers represent 96 percent of the Red Cross workforce. Without 
their giving spirit, disaster relief operations would fall short, blood 
donations would fail, and the mission of the Red Cross would go 
unfulfilled. Whether helping military families stay connected with 
service members around the world, teaching CPR and first aid, or 
supporting other members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Movement, volunteers are critical to the success of each and every Red 
Cross endeavor. These individuals epitomize the generosity and community 
spirit of the American people.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States do hereby proclaim March 2009 as American Red Cross Month. I 
encourage all Americans to support this organization's noble 
humanitarian mission.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8347 of February 27, 2009

National Consumer Protection Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Consumer education helps every American who enters the marketplace. 
When making a purchase, consumers should know their rights and should 
learn about goods and services before they buy. This knowledge allows 
consumers to make sound decisions and protects families and individuals 
from fraud and abuse. Consumer vigilance also prevents problems before 
they arise. During National Consumer Protection Week, we highlight 
consumer education efforts to help Americans make wise decisions. 
Federal, State, and local agencies; private sector organizations; and 
consumer advocacy groups band together to encourage Americans to learn 
about the protections the law affords and to take full advantage of the 
resources available for consumers of every age.
 This year's theme for National Consumer Protection Week, ``Nuts & 
Bolts: Tools for Today's Economy,'' focuses on the basic information 
consumers need as they face the opportunities and pitfalls of the 
marketplace. Every day, consumers make tough choices about saving, 
investing, and spending their hard-earned money. Whether selecting a 
mortgage payment plan, seeking a credit report, or buying a car, staying 
well-informed and vigilant can help citizens make prudent choices. A few 
days, hours, or even minutes of preparatory research can ultimately save 
time and money.
 As part of National Consumer Protection Week, the Federal Trade 
Commission has organized a coalition of public- and private-sector 
organizations to provide practical tips on a wide range of topics. These 
tips are available at www.consumer.gov/ncpw. The website also includes 
information on home foreclosure, identity theft, and protecting 
businesses. Working together, consumers, businesses, and Government can 
strengthen our robust free market for the benefit of all Americans.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1 through March 7, 
2009, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon Government 
officials, industry leaders, and advocates across the Nation to provide 
our citizens with information about consumer rights, and I encourage all 
Americans to take a proactive role in strengthening our economy.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8348 of February 27, 2009

Save Your Vision Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Blindness and visual impairment affect millions of Americans. Early 
diagnosis and timely treatment are critical to minimize vision loss from 
eye diseases as well as vision loss that is correctable with eye glasses 
or contact lenses. During Save Your Vision Week, I encourage all 
Americans to take action to protect their vision.
 Unfortunately, most people have limited knowledge of blinding eye 
disorders. In a 2005 study by the National Eye Institute, part of the 
National Institutes of Health, only eight percent of respondents knew 
that glaucoma, a condition that can damage the optic nerve and cause 
vision loss and blindness, strikes without early warning. Similarly, 
only 11 percent knew that diabetic eye disease also begins as a silent 
vision threat.
 Several demographic groups are at higher risk for visual impairment, 
including teenagers, diabetics, Hispanics, African Americans, and the 
economically disadvantaged. Older Americans are more susceptible to eye 
conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic 
retinopathy, and glaucoma. Children need regular vision screenings 
because vision disorders left untreated during childhood can lead to 
permanent visual impairment during adulthood.
 Still, eye disease knows no bounds, and every American should take 
steps to protect his or her eyesight. Doctors recommend seeking routine 
eye examinations, maintaining a healthy diet, wearing sunglasses to 
protect the eyes from damaging ultraviolet rays, and using protective 
eyewear in hazardous environments. The National Eye Institute's website, 
www.nei.nih.gov, provides resources for learning more about common 
vision conditions and information on finding an eye health professional. 
By being proactive and seeking out information, Americans can do their 
part to prevent or reduce vision loss.
 To remind Americans about the importance of safeguarding their 
eyesight, the Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, 
as amended (77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and requested 
the President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as ``Save 
Your Vision Week.''
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 1 through March 7, 2009, as Save Your 
Vision Week. During this time, I invite eye care professionals, 
teachers, members of the media, and all organizations dedicated to 
preserving eyesight to join in activities that will raise awareness of 
vision diseases and disorders.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8349 of February 27, 2009

Read Across America Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Read Across America Day provides an opportunity to support efforts to 
excite children about reading and to educate families about the 
importance of literacy. I encourage families and all citizens to 
celebrate the joy and emphasize the importance of reading.
 Every American child deserves the opportunity to solve the puzzles of 
mystery novels, to discover the beauty of poetry, to imagine the 
fantastical worlds of science fiction, and to explore their own world 
through books about nature and foreign lands. Reading provides unending 
enjoyment and helps unlock a child's creative potential. We must make 
literacy the birthright of every American.
Every child also deserves the tools they will need for success. Students 
must read well to meet high standards in the classroom. Understanding 
science, mathematics, and the arts requires the ability to read 
proficiently. Beyond the schoolyard, our youth must be prepared to meet 
the demands of the global economy. New technologies and steep 
competition abroad require our Nation to focus on children's reading 
skills as a building block for future personal achievements.
 Families must play an active role in this effort. On Read Across 
America Day, parents are encouraged to read to their children for at 
least 30 minutes. I also encourage parents to recognize the critical 
importance of literacy for their children's future and to develop habits 
at home that encourage reading, such as reading to their children every 
night or providing incentives for them to read on their own.
 On Read Across America Day, we partner with the National Education 
Association and mark the birthday of Theodor Geisel, whose beloved Dr. 
Seuss books still inspire children throughout the world to read.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2, 2009, as Read 
Across America Day. I call upon children, families, educators, 
librarians, public officials, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the

Proclamation 8350 of March 2, 2009

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Even before the birth of our Nation, the sons and daughters of Erin 
departed their homes in search of liberty and a more hopeful future. As 
these early pioneers left familiar lands, they carried with them the 
rich traditions of home. This March we honor their journey and their 
lasting contributions to the history and culture of the United States.
Following the colonial migrations, the United States enjoyed the 
greatest influx of Irish during the 1840s as Ireland suffered the Great 
Famine. Hungry but hopeful, poor but perseverant, Irish-Americans seized 
the opportunity to work hard, enjoy success, and pursue the American 
Dream.
Many took on the difficult work of constructing America's 
infrastructure. Others assumed positions of leadership. Among those 
leaders were signers of the Declaration of Independence and Presidents 
of the United States. Still others enjoyed great success and influence 
in the arts and literature. From social activists to business leaders, 
athletes to clergy, and first responders to soldiers, distinguished 
Irish-Americans have made indelible contributions to our national 
identity.
Today, tens of millions of Irish-Americans can look back with pride on 
the legacy of their forebears. Irish-Americans are integral to the rich 
fabric of the United States, and we are grateful for their service and 
contributions.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2009 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month 
with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8351 of March 3, 2009

Women's History Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 With passion and courage, women have taught us that when we band 
together to advocate for our highest ideals, we can advance our common 
well-being and strengthen the fabric of our Nation. Each year during 
Women's History Month, we remember and celebrate women from all walks of 
life who have shaped this great Nation. This year, in accordance with 
the theme, ``Women Taking the Lead to Save our Planet,'' we pay 
particular tribute to the efforts of women in preserving and protecting 
the environment for present and future generations.
 Ellen Swallow Richards is known to have been the first woman in the 
United States to be accepted at a scientific school. She graduated from 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1873 and went on to become 
a prominent chemist. In 1887, she conducted a survey of water quality in 
Massachusetts. This study, the first of its kind in America, led to the 
Nation's first state water-quality standards.
 Women have also taken the lead throughout our history in preserving our 
natural environment. In 1900, Maria Sanford led the Minnesota Federation 
of Women's Groups in their efforts to protect forestland near the 
Mississippi River, which eventually became the Chippewa National Forest, 
the first Congressionally mandated national forest. Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas dedicated her life to protecting and restoring the Florida 
Everglades. Her book, The Everglades: Rivers of Grass, published in 
1947, led to the preservation of the Everglades as a National Park. She 
was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.
Rachel Carson brought even greater attention to the environment by 
exposing the dangers of certain pesticides to the environment and to 
human health. Her landmark 1962 book, Silent Spring, was fiercely 
criticized for its unconventional perspective. As early as 1963, 
however, President Kennedy acknowledged its importance and appointed a 
panel to investigate the book's findings. Silent Spring has emerged as a 
seminal work in environmental studies. Carson was awarded the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1980.
 Grace Thorpe, another leading environmental advocate, also connected 
environmental protection with human well-being by emphasizing the 
vulnerability of certain populations to environmental hazards. In 1992, 
she launched a successful campaign to organize Native Americans to 
oppose the storage of nuclear waste on their reservations, which she 
said contradicted Native American principles of stewardship of the 
earth. She also proposed that America invest in alternative energy 
sources such as hydroelectricity, solar power, and wind power.
 These women helped protect our environment and our people while 
challenging the status quo and breaking social barriers. Their 
achievements inspired generations of American women and men not only to 
save our planet, but also to overcome obstacles and pursue their 
interests and talents. They join a long and proud history of American 
women leaders, and this month we honor the contributions of all women to 
our Nation.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2009 as Women's 
History Month. I call upon all our citizens to observe this month with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the history, 
accomplishments, and contributions of American women.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

National Poison Prevention Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since 1962, National Poison Prevention Week has helped raise awareness 
about the dangers of potentially poisonous substances and has provided 
the opportunity to educate fellow Americans about preventing and 
responding to poisonings. This education effort is critical to the well-
being of children and adults alike, as both remain susceptible to poison 
exposure.
According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), 
more than two million potential poison exposures are reported to the 
Nation's 61 poison control centers every year. More than half of those 
exposures involve children aged five and under. The AAPCC also reports 
that more than one thousand deaths due to poisoning take place in the 
United States every year.
Poisoning most frequently involves medicines and typical household 
chemicals, including cleaning supplies and personal care products. When 
improperly stored, these substances can present threats to the health 
and well-being of people subject to exposure. Taking simple steps can 
protect family and friends from harm. For example, keeping poisonous 
materials in their original containers, placing these materials out of 
children's reach, following handling instructions and recommended 
dosages, and installing carbon monoxide detectors can all help save 
lives. More information can be found at www.aapcc.org. In the event of a 
potential poisoning, experts at local poison control centers can be 
reached at 1-800-222-1222. As children and adults suffer from poison 
exposures, all Americans should take seriously this grave health risk.
 To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.'' I encourage all Americans to familiarize themselves 
with this issue and take steps to protect their families.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 15 through March 21, 2009, as National 
Poison Prevention Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8353 of March 24, 2009

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 The American people join Hellenes today in commemorating the 188th 
anniversary of Greece's independence. As we celebrate the establishment 
of the Hellenic Republic, we honor the historic contributions of Greeks 
and Greek-Americans.
 Americans celebrated the cause of Greek independence during the new 
nation's earliest years. In 1824, summarizing support for the Greek 
struggle among the American people, then-Representative Henry Clay 
declared, ``That it is felt with the deepest intensity, expressed in 
almost every possible form, and that it increases with every new day and 
passing hour.'' His words are echoed today as Americans celebrate the 
anniversary of this struggle for independence.
 The relationship between Greece and the United States owes much to the 
vision of democracy and liberty forged in Greece. In constructing a 
modern democratic framework, our Nation's founders drew upon the 
immutable principles of the ancient Greeks. All who cherish the ideal of 
democratic governance are beneficiaries of the Greek legacy.
 From the literary classics taught in our children's classrooms to the 
gleaming monuments of our Nation's capital, Greek cultural traditions 
have also found a home in the United States. In classrooms across the 
country, many of our students still immerse themselves in the epics of 
Homer, the dramas of Sophocles, and the philosophical innovations of 
Plato and Aristotle. Among the Greek-influenced structures in 
Washington, D.C., our Nation's Capitol Building draws upon the 
architectural legacy of the ancient Greeks.
 In recent history, Greece and the United States have stood together to 
meet the challenges of our times. Greeks and Americans fought for common 
causes over the course of the 20th century and continue to collaborate 
in this century, including through membership in the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization.
 The strength of the bond between Greece and the United States is 
exemplified by the Greek-American community, which enriches our Nation 
with its cultural heritage and helps maintain the living relationship 
between our countries.
 On the anniversary of Greece's independence, we celebrate this 
friendship and look forward to realizing our common goals and 
aspirations.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2009, as ``Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy.'' I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8354 of April 1, 2009

National Cancer Control Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We have achieved remarkable progress in the fight against cancer. 
Miracles in medical research have helped us understand how to prevent, 
detect, and treat cancer more effectively, and Americans are now more 
aware of how to protect themselves from this disease.
Despite this progress, cancer continues to kill more Americans than any 
other malady but heart disease. Marking National Cancer Control Month, 
we recommit to the battle against cancer and emphasize the promise of 
medical research and the healthy steps Americans can take to protect 
themselves.
To gain new ground in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment, my 
Administration will continue to press for increased support for research 
at the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and academic and other 
institutions. The Federal Government plays an indispensable role in 
investing in this research, which will save and improve lives for 
generations to come.
As researchers work daily to better understand this disease, Americans 
can take steps to decrease their risk of developing cancer. Individuals 
of all ages should seek regular and appropriate check-ups. These check-
ups should include screening, such as mammograms, the Pap test, and 
tests for colorectal cancer, all of which can help detect cancer during 
its early stages.
Healthy personal habits can also reduce the risk of cancer. Smoking 
accounts for thousands of cancer deaths every year, and quitting--even 
after many years--can greatly reduce the risk of cancer. Physical 
inactivity and obesity may cause a substantial proportion of colon, 
breast, endometrial, kidney, and esophageal cancers in the United 
States, so maintaining physical activity and a healthy diet can help 
prevent cancer, among other diseases. Finally, moderating alcohol intake 
and sun exposure can help protect Americans.
Too many American families have been touched by cancer. As we observe 
National Cancer Control Month, I call upon all courageous cancer 
patients and survivors, health care providers, researchers, advocates, 
and others involved in this struggle to work together in support of our 
Nation's goal to control, and ultimately defeat, this devastating 
disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2009 as National 
Cancer Control Month. I encourage citizens, medical institutions, 
government and social service agencies, businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
help control cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8355 of April 1, 2009

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When the child next door is maltreated, we all suffer. Every American 
has a stake in the well-being of our Nation's children. They are members 
of our communities, and they are our future. National Child Abuse 
Prevention Month provides the opportunity to underscore our commitment 
to preventing and responding appropriately to child abuse. This month, 
we emphasize the importance of understanding child abuse and the need 
for all Americans to help families overcome this devastating problem.
The tragedy of child abuse may afflict American children in different 
ways. Abuse may occur physically, sexually, and emotionally. Child 
neglect, another form of child maltreatment, may occur physically and 
emotionally. Understanding the forms of child abuse is critical to 
preventing and responding to maltreatment.
A well-informed and strong family is the surest defense against child 
abuse. To help educate and strengthen families, community members can 
offer their time and counsel to parents and children who may need 
assistance. For example, parent support groups provide an organized 
forum for assistance. More informally, community members may simply 
offer a helping hand to families under stress. More information about 
what families and communities can do is available at 
www.childwelfare.gov/preventing.
Civic organizations and government also have an important role to play. 
Civic groups offer essential support through education, assistance to 
those at risk, and treatment for victims. Government at the local, 
State, and Federal level must provide funding for services, conduct 
public education projects, and enforce child abuse laws.
As we recognize that we all suffer when our children are abused, that we 
all benefit from mutual concern and care, and that we all have a 
responsibility to help, more American children will grow up healthy, 
happy, and with unlimited potential for success.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2009, as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I encourage all citizens to help prevent 
and respond to child abuse by strengthening families and contributing to 
all children's physical, emotional, and developmental needs.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8356 of April 1, 2009

National Donate Life Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Through organ, tissue, and marrow donation Americans can give the 
extraordinary gift of life. National Donate Life Month provides an 
opportunity to honor those who have given of themselves to save lives 
and to call upon others to participate in this generous effort.
 Every day in our Nation and across the world, Americans dedicate 
themselves to helping those in need. During times of crisis and calm, 
Americans have looked beyond themselves to aid friends and strangers 
alike. This spirit of giving represents a hallmark of our national 
character.
 Many Americans have followed this tradition of generosity through 
organ, tissue, and marrow donation. These selfless individuals have 
saved lives and strengthened families and communities, and they deserve 
respect and admiration for their contributions.
 I urge all Americans to follow these examples by considering becoming 
an organ, tissue, or marrow donor. The call for help from those in need 
of transplants is clear. More donors are needed to meet the needs of 
those on the national waiting list for life-saving transplants. When 
considering organ donation, Americans should consult family members to 
ensure that loved ones are fully aware of the donor's decisions.
 Joining the ranks of organ donors is simple. I encourage Americans to 
learn more about becoming a donor at www.organdonor.gov.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2009 as National 
Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, 
educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and 
private organizations to join forces to increase the number of organ and 
tissue donors throughout our Nation.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8357 of April 3, 2009

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The education we provide our children must prepare them to succeed in a 
global economy and to contribute to their communities. Commemorating 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., we underscore our commitment to a 
competitive and complete education.
The professional demands of today's workplace require a renewed 
commitment to education. Our youngest children need a strong early 
foundation. Standards must be raised, curricula must be enhanced, and 
teachers must be supported. Families, communities, and educators must 
collaborate to ensure that students are working hard and receiving the 
best instruction possible.
Yet knowledge alone will not bring the future our children deserve. Our 
schools and community institutions must also help each child develop a 
moral compass. Education must blend basic American values such as 
honesty, personal responsibility, and service. These indispensable 
elements will not only help children succeed in challenging work 
environments, they will also help our youth engage in and contribute to 
their communities.
Few have better understood or more successfully promoted these ideas 
than Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who 
emphasized the importance of education and good character. Through the 
establishment of educational and social service institutions across the 
country and the world, Rabbi Schneerson sought to empower young people 
and inspire individuals of all ages. On this day, we raise his call 
anew.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 5, 2009, as 
``Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2009.'' I call upon all the people 
of the United States to look to the future with a renewed sense of civic 
engagement and common purpose.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8358 of April 8, 2009

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Drugs, gangs, and violence threaten our children and communities every 
day. Today we commemorate Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.), a 
program that has worked to educate children and protect them from these 
problems. National D.A.R.E. Day provides the opportunity to reflect upon 
the dangers of drugs, gangs, and violence and to emphasize efforts to 
combat these threats.
From inner cities to suburbs and rural communities, gangs and drug 
dealers prey upon youth across the United States. Unaware of the dangers 
of drug abuse and violence, many youth surrender the promise of a bright 
future. Every child lost in this battle represents a tragedy for our 
Nation, and we must do more to stop it.
Education efforts to help children avoid drugs and violence must begin 
in the home. Parents must be positive role models and take the lead in 
advising their children on the effects of drugs on their health and 
well-being.
The D.A.R.E. program has worked to educate students about drugs, gangs, 
and violence for more than 25 years. Placing law-enforcement personnel 
in the classroom, D.A.R.E. provides students with important lessons from 
experts and seeks to prepare them for the difficult encounters and 
choices they may face.
Today we honor D.A.R.E. for its important work. The efforts of 
D.A.R.E.'s instructors and supporters benefit our Nation's children and 
are deserving of praise and appreciation. D.A.R.E.'s renewed efforts to 
implement science-based programs and to strengthen partnerships among 
law enforcement, families, and their communities are particularly worthy 
of commendation. Through effective teaching methods and broad 
participation, D.A.R.E. can help ensure that every child in America 
enjoys the opportunities he or she deserves.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 8, 2009, as National 
D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon our youth, parents, educators, law enforcement 
personnel, and all the people of the United States to observe this day 
with appropriate programs and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8359 of April 8, 2009

National Sexual Assault Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sexual assault scars the lives of millions in the United States. To 
increase awareness about this issue, prevent future crimes, and aid 
victims, this month we mark National Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
Sexual assault is pervasive in the United States. Study after study has 
shown that this crime impacts people at all age levels and in every part 
of this Nation. One recent study found that 18 percent of women in this 
country have been raped in their lifetime. In addition, rates of sexual 
assault remain startlingly high for students from high school to 
college. A 2005 survey of high school students found that 10.8 percent 
of girls and 4.2 percent of boys from grades nine to twelve were forced 
to have sexual intercourse at some time in their lives. A study of 
college women found that 13.7 percent of undergraduate women had been 
victims of at least one completed sexual assault since entering college. 
Unlike victims of sexual assault in the larger community, students 
victimized by other students often face additional challenges in a 
``closed'' campus environment. For example, a victim may continue to 
live in danger if the perpetrator resides in the same dormitory or 
attends the same classes. These statistics are all the more alarming 
given that, according to recent research, a majority of victims do not 
report their attacks to police.
Victims of all ages suffer from both the physical and emotional 
consequences of the attack. Sexual assault can lead to long-term health 
problems including chronic pain, stomach problems, and sexually 
transmitted diseases. It can also cause severe emotional harm that may 
be even more painful than the assault itself and resulting physical 
injuries. The effects of sexual assault go well beyond the direct 
victim: sexual assault also has a profound impact on a victim's family, 
friends, neighbors, and workplace.
Victims need an array of services to heal from the trauma of sexual 
assault, including crisis intervention, 24-hour sexual assault hotlines, 
medical and criminal justice accompaniment, advocacy, and counseling. 
Victim service providers are essential to this effort and work 
tirelessly to help victims cope with the trauma of sexual assault and 
transition from ``victim'' to ``survivor.''
Landmark legislation has helped fund these critical services. The 
Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA, Public Law 98-473) established the 
Crime Victims Fund to fund services such as forensic sexual assault 
examinations and compensation claims for both adult and child victims. 
For example, since 1997, VOCA funding has supported the development of 
Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) programs and multi-disciplinary 
Sexual Assault Response Teams (SART). The Violence Against Women Act of 
2005 (VAWA, Public Law 109-162) authorized the Sexual Assault Services 
Program, the first Federal funding dedicated exclusively to sexual 
assault services. The Program includes funding for culturally specific 
programs that serve victims who face unique cultural and linguistic 
barriers.
In addition to helping victims, offenders must be held accountable for 
their crimes. Sexual assault forensic examinations and trained examiners 
can ensure that victims are treated with requisite sensitivity and that 
critical evidence is collected to facilitate a successful prosecution. 
To this end, VAWA mandates that all States that accept Federal grants to 
combat violence against women ensure that sexual assault victims receive 
forensic examinations free of charge, even if the victim chooses not to 
report the crime to the police.
To make continued progress, my Administration supports efforts to help 
Americans better understand this issue. Working together, we can reduce 
the incidence of sexual assault and help all who have experienced this 
heinous crime.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2009, as National 
Sexual Assault Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to respond to 
sexual assault by creating policies at work and school, by engaging in 
discussions with family and friends, and by making the prevention of 
sexual assault a priority in their communities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8360 of April 9, 2009

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 American prisoners of war exemplify the courage and sacrifice that 
define our men and women in uniform. These brave warriors have paid a 
massive share of the costs of freedom, and our Nation will be forever in 
their debt. Today we honor all prisoners of war by recognizing the 
tremendous sacrifices made and the hardships endured by those who fight 
for our freedom.
 American prisoners of war have experienced extreme conditions across 
the world and many have made the ultimate sacrifice. Sixty-seven years 
ago, in the midst of World War II, nearly 12,000 Americans and 76,000 
Filipinos were captured while defending positions on the Bataan 
Peninsula in the Philippines. As prisoners of war, they endured the 
Bataan Death March, suffering starvation, torture, and unspeakable 
conditions. Thousands were randomly executed and many perished on this 
journey. During the Korean War, more than 1,600 Americans died under 
grave conditions at the Pyok Tong camp. In Vietnam's Hoa Lo Prison--the 
infamous Hanoi Hilton--Americans endured torture and other forms of 
inhumane treatment.
 There are countless tales of the bravery of American prisoners of war--
of the burdens borne, of the acts of heroism. These individuals have 
made great sacrifices and have demonstrated an enduring faith in 
themselves and in the United States. Their commitment calls out to all 
Americans to live up to our Nation's highest ideals and to serve our 
fellow citizens with equal selflessness and honor. We will never forget 
their sacrifices. Their spirit of service will inspire the American 
people for generations to come.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2009, as National Former 
Prisoner of War Recognition Day, and I urge all Americans to observe 
this day of remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8361 of April 14, 2009

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A common heritage, an interconnected world, and shared goals and values 
unite the Pan American community. As a proud member of this group of 
countries, the United States celebrates Pan American Day and Pan 
American Week and commits to working with our partners in the 
Organization of American States to advance a common future.
 The Pan American community is highly interwoven, and the peoples of the 
Americas must work together to build the future we seek. When one 
country faces economic, security, or health challenges, its neighbors 
share in this hardship. Together, the Pan American community can build 
strong partnerships to surmount common concerns and further mutual 
success.
The broad scope of shared goals includes economic growth and equality, 
increased security, strong democratic governance, and clean energy. 
Robust, bottom-up economic growth benefits all citizens and all nations, 
and remains a central goal of the Pan American community. Together, the 
countries of the Americas can prioritize and enact policies that ensure 
a shared and equitable economic prosperity. This economic future is 
possible only if we protect the safety of citizens and the security of 
our countries. Whether reducing street crime and gang violence, 
decreasing the narcotics trade, or preventing acts of terrorism, every 
country has a stake in regional security.
The Pan American community also supports strong democracies and the 
development of alternative energy sources. The promotion of transparent 
and enduring democratic governance strengthens and defines relations in 
the region and should emphasize the rule of law, a robust civil society, 
respect for human rights, social equality, and effective delivery of 
public services. Finally, every country benefits from a solution to our 
shared energy and climate challenges. The region has already witnessed 
great leadership in the development and deployment of alternative energy 
sources, and the Pan American community must build upon these promising 
efforts.
As we celebrate Pan American Day and Pan American Week, and participate 
in the Summit of the Americas, the United States recognizes the common 
challenges and aspirations that unite the region and the boundless 
promise of our continuing partnership.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2009, as Pan 
American Day and April 12 through 18 as Pan American Week. I urge the 
Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the United 
States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8362 of April 17, 2009

National Park Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's National Parks are among our Nation's most precious treasures. 
During National Park Week, we celebrate these spaces and commit to 
protecting them for future generations of Americans.
National Parks bring together Americans of all backgrounds and help us 
understand the story of America. From the Lincoln Memorial and Ellis 
Island to the Great Smoky Mountains and Yellowstone, National Parks 
attract visitors from across the country and from all walks of life. The 
grandeur and simplicity of these areas inspire visitors no matter their 
personal stories. National Parks also help Americans learn more about 
our shared history. From the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument to 
the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, National Parks allow Americans 
to explore our Nation's past and to understand events that occurred over 
the long course of our history.
Our system of National Parks is entrusted to each generation of 
Americans. We have an obligation to our children to keep these spaces 
pristine. As citizen stewards, Americans can participate in efforts in 
their communities to preserve National Parks, and support policies that 
achieve this end. My Administration continues to advocate for 
initiatives that protect and expand National Parks. The American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act promotes conservation and creates new job 
opportunities in National Parks, and the Omnibus Public Land Management 
Act designates thousands of miles of trails for the National Trails 
System, protects more than 1,000 miles of rivers, and secures millions 
of acres of wilderness.
This week we also honor the committed professionals and volunteers 
working every day to support the National Parks. Laboring among towering 
mountains and broad plains, in city centers, and along our rivers and 
seashores, these Americans deserve thanks for their contributions to 
current and future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 
26, 2009, as National Park Week. I invite all my fellow citizens to join 
me in commemorating the 2009 theme for National Park Week, ``National 
and Community Service,'' and to visit these wonderful spaces, discover 
all they have to offer, and become active participants in Park 
conservation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8363 of April 21, 2009

National Volunteer Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Our Nation's story begins with a call to volunteer. Confronting the 
injustices of tyranny and small odds of victory, patriots rallied one 
another to serve a cause greater than themselves. As the beneficiaries 
of this legacy, we possess an obligation to volunteer and serve our 
fellow citizens with similar selflessness and optimism.
 Americans keep this proud tradition alive every day across our country. 
They are protecting us in uniform, feeding the hungry, tutoring 
children, comforting seniors, and reaching out to veterans. They are 
providing critical support to schools, shelters, hospitals, and nursing 
homes, through faith-based and community organizations, at home and 
abroad. Volunteers change lives and strengthen our Nation and our world.
 My Administration is committed to supporting and supplementing the 
crucial efforts that Americans make to volunteer. The Edward M. Kennedy 
Serve America Act, which I signed into law today, will help millions of 
Americans of all ages to volunteer and to direct that service towards 
meeting our most pressing challenges. It truly will usher in a new era 
of service.
 This landmark law recruits an army of 250,000 per year to engage in 
intensive service, and it focuses that work on today's challenges, 
including clean energy, education, health, veterans care, and economic 
opportunity. It creates new service opportunities for seniors, baby 
boomers, and young adults, and improves service learning in our schools.
 The law also creates a Social Innovation Fund. This fund looks for new 
ideas in communities and leverages private, nonprofit, and faith-based 
support to invest in local innovation. The fund also allows us to test 
the impact of new ideas and expand successful programs to scale.
 Volunteering provides the opportunity to join and better a community. 
Every American who volunteers can become an integral part of a school, a 
hospital, or a neighborhood. Those who give of their time also join our 
Nation's proud history of service and help preserve this tradition for 
generations ahead. During National Volunteer Week, we express heartfelt 
thanks to all who have worked hard in this effort, and we urge more 
Americans to reach out and meet the manifold unmet needs of fellow 
Americans.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19-25, 2009 as 
National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to join ongoing 
volunteer service efforts, and to create new ones.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8364 of April 22, 2009

Earth Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 The story of the United States is inextricably tied to our vital 
natural resources. As we enter a new era filled with challenges and 
promise, we must protect our land, wildlife, water and air--the 
resources that have fueled our growth and prosperity as a Nation and 
enriched our lives. Doing this not only fulfills a sacred obligation to 
our children and grandchildren, but also provides an opportunity to 
stimulate economic growth.
 To achieve these ends, no issue deserves more immediate attention than 
global warming. Scientists have already observed alarming shifts in the 
natural world, including thawing permafrost, melting glaciers, and 
rising sea levels.
 Climate change presents a serious test for humankind, but it also 
provides an opportunity for great innovation and adaptation. The United 
States has risen to such challenges before, and Earth Day inspires us to 
transcend differences among nations so we may lead the world in 
protecting our planet from this global threat.
 Americans across the country are working hard to help limit the 
pollutants that cause climate change and reduce their impact on the 
environment, but we must do more. Individuals and organizations can 
plant trees, use energy efficient lightbulbs, drive fuel efficient cars, 
hold clean-up drives, and teach young people about environmental 
preservation. Small changes in our daily lives can have a big impact on 
our environment. Individuals can walk, bike, and use public 
transportation; buy products with less packaging; and recycle and reuse 
paper, plastic, glass, and aluminum more often. American families can 
also save money by choosing energy efficient products, turning lights 
off, unplugging appliances, and cutting back on heating and air 
conditioning.
 Government and business alike must also take serious and sustained 
action to protect our valuable natural inheritance. Through investments 
in scientific research and development, and the vigorous pursuit of 
alternative and renewable energy, we can create millions of green jobs 
that allow us to reduce greenhouse gases and excel in a competitive 
global economy. My Administration is committed to increasing fuel 
economy standards and putting more Plug-In Hybrid cars on the road, 
weatherizing millions of homes, and catalyzing private efforts to build 
a clean energy future. My Administration is also working to achieve a 
comprehensive energy and climate policy, one that will lessen our 
dependence on foreign oil, make the U.S. the global leader in clean 
energy technology, and prevent the worst impacts of climate change.
 President Theodore Roosevelt emphasized our obligation to future 
Americans, saying, ``of all the questions which can come before this 
nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great 
war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central 
task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it 
is for us.'' Heeding President Roosevelt's call, and carrying forward 
his spirit of determination, we must commit ourselves to protecting our 
environment and ensuring the health of our planet so we may share the 
magnificent blessings of our Earth with our grandchildren.
 We do this not only to acknowledge the environment's central role in 
the development of our Nation but also to recognize the strong 
ecological interdependence among nations. History has shown that as we 
sow, so too shall we reap. Let us rededicate ourselves to a world that 
provides bountiful harvests for us all not just today, but for many 
generations to come.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2009, as Earth 
Day. I encourage all citizens to help protect our environment and 
contribute to a healthy, sustainable world.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8365 of April 24, 2009

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 From violence in our neighborhoods to credit card fraud on the 
Internet, Americans fall victim to countless crimes every day. Our 
Nation has no higher responsibility than protecting the safety of our 
families. During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we honor crime 
victims by pledging to fight crime wherever it exists.
 This commitment begins by supporting the men and women working every 
day to reduce crime and assist crime victims. Often placing themselves 
in harm's way and sacrificing personal interests, these individuals are 
the backbone of the extensive efforts to protect Americans from crime. 
They have demonstrated a commitment to serve others, and their 
dedication is vital to implementing a successful strategy for crime 
reduction and victim assistance.
 Crime victims have benefited from the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 
(Public Law 98-473), one of the most significant achievements in crime 
victim assistance. This law created an innovative method for using fines 
and penalties from Federal criminals to fund services for victims. This 
Crime Victims Fund has already helped millions of victims across the 
country access basic assistance and financial compensation. This year 
marks the 25th anniversary of the bill's bipartisan passage.
 An effective approach to fighting crime must include programs that make 
sense and work. To that end, my Administration is building on past 
achievements to address the range of crimes that Americans may 
encounter. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which I signed in 
February, helps State and local law enforcement personnel perform 
critical work by providing $2 billion through the Edward Byrne Justice 
Assistance Grant Program.
 A smart crime reduction strategy must also incorporate outreach to 
those who have paid their debt to society and have become responsible 
and contributing members of their communities. Prisoner reentry programs 
have been tested and proven effective. Through a number of supportive 
services, including substance abuse and mental health counseling, 
prison-to-work incentives, job training, and transitional assistance, 
reentry programs help reduce crime recidivism and keep families safer. 
By utilizing common-sense and proven methods, we can both reduce crime 
and serve crime victims.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 26 through May 
2, 2009, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this week by participating in events that raise 
awareness of victims' rights and services and by volunteering to serve 
victims in their time of need.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8366 of April 28, 2009

National Equal Pay Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Harriet Beecher Stowe helped galvanize the abolitionist movement with 
her groundbreaking literature. Frances Perkins advised President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and led the Department of Labor during one of 
its most challenging periods in history. Barbara McClintock helped 
unlock the mysteries of genetics and earned a Nobel Prize. These and 
countless other women have broken barriers and changed the course of our 
history, allowing women and men who followed them the opportunity to 
reach greater heights.
 Despite these achievements, 46 years since the passage of the Equal Pay 
Act and 233 years since our Nation was established with the principle of 
equal justice under law, women across America continue to experience 
discrimination in the form of pay inequity every day. Women in the 
United States earn only 78 cents for every dollar a man earns, and today 
marks the inauspicious occasion when a woman's earnings finally catch up 
with a man's from the previous year. On National Equal Pay Day, we 
underscore the importance of this issue to all Americans.
 If we wish to honor our Nation's highest ideals, we must end wage 
discrimination. The Founders established a timeless framework of rights 
for the American people. Generation after generation has worked and 
sacrificed so that this framework might be applied equally to all 
Americans. To honor these Americans and stay true to our founding 
ideals, we must carry forward this tradition and breathe life into these 
principles by supporting equal pay for men and women.
 Wage discrimination has a tangible and negative impact on women and 
families. When women receive less than their deserved compensation, they 
take home less for themselves and their loved ones. Utilities and 
groceries are more difficult to afford. Mortgages and rent bills are 
harder to pay. Children's higher education is less financially feasible. 
In later years of life, the retirement that many women have worked so 
hard for--and have earned--is not possible. This problem is particularly 
dire for women who are single and the sole supporters of their families. 
Women should not and need not endure these consequences.
 My Administration is working to advance pay equity in the United 
States. The first bill I signed into law as President, the Lilly 
Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, allows more women to challenge pay 
discrimination by extending the timeline within which complaints can be 
filed. This law advances the struggle for equal pay, but it is only an 
initial step. To continue this progress, I issued an Executive Order 
establishing the White House Council on Women and Girls. This high-level 
body, composed of Cabinet members and heads of sub-Cabinet agencies, is 
charged with advancing the rights and needs of women, including equal 
pay.
 Still, Government can only advance this issue so far. The collective 
action of businesses, community organizations, and individuals is 
necessary to ensure that every woman receives just treatment and 
compensation. We Americans must come together to ensure equal pay for 
both women and men by reminding ourselves of the basic principles that 
underlie our Nation's strength and unity, understanding the unnecessary 
sacrifices that pay inequity causes, and recalling the countless women 
leaders who have proven what women can achieve.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2009, as 
National Equal Pay Day. I call upon American men and women, and all 
employers, to acknowledge the injustice of wage discrimination and to 
commit themselves to equal pay for equal work.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.

Proclamation 8367 of April 30, 2009

Law Day, U.S.A., 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 In 1958, President Eisenhower established Law Day as ``a day of 
national dedication to the principles of government under law.'' Each 
year on Law Day, we celebrate our commitment to the rule of law. That 
great commitment is enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the 
United States Constitution, and has been reaffirmed by the words and 
deeds of great Americans throughout our Nation's history.
 This year we celebrate the bicentennial of the birth of one such 
American, President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln rose from humble beginnings 
to guide our Nation through the most turbulent period in its history. 
His dedication to the rule of law and to equality under the law, and his 
refusal to retreat from the greatest moral challenge ever to confront 
us, gave us the Emancipation Proclamation and the preservation of our 
Union. His dedication also gave us the Gettysburg Address, with its 
resolution that ``government of the people, by the people, for the 
people, shall not perish from the earth.'' Indeed, Lincoln was one of 
the greatest Presidents and one of the greatest lawyers, in our Nation's 
history.
 Lincoln's lasting legacy is his vision of the ``more perfect Union'' 
promised in our Constitution's preamble. According to Lincoln, ``The 
legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people 
whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot do so 
well for themselves, in their separate and individual capacities.'' This 
vision of a true United States of America, bound together by a 
recognition of the common good, guided our country through its darkest 
hour and helped it re-emerge as a beacon of freedom and equality under 
law.
 On this Law Day, I encourage Americans to reflect on this legacy. By 
continuing a national conversation on the principles for which Lincoln 
stood, and by highlighting the attributes of this great American, we can 
help ensure that the legacy of our sixteenth President endures and that 
the United States remains dedicated to the principles of government 
under law.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2009, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon the people of the 
United States to acknowledge the importance of our Nation's legal and 
judicial systems with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to 
display the flag of the United States in support of this national 
observance.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.
BARACK OBAMA

Proclamation 8368 of May 1, 2009

Loyalty Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than two centuries ago, our Nation's Founders declared the birth of 
a new Nation and began an experiment in self-governance. The young 
Republic committed itself to protecting the rights of life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness for all citizens. These ideals inspired loyalty 
to the young Nation and moved volunteers to fight for their 
independence.
Generations later, these founding principles continue to unify and 
command the loyalty of the American people. The United States has 
expanded in size, increased in population, and grown in diversity, yet 
the promise of liberty and the pursuit of happiness arouse the 
patriotism and loyalty of Americans anew. Just as early settlers pledged 
to do their part to build the new Nation, now recent immigrants--loyal 
to the very same values--are helping America fulfill its promise.
We enjoy these blessings of liberty only because brave patriots have 
answered the call of duty. The men and women of the United States Armed 
Forces exemplify loyalty to our highest ideals, as do those who have 
fought valiantly for civil rights within our borders. These Americans 
and many others have made enormous sacrifices, and our Nation is 
grateful for their selflessness and unshakeable loyalty.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated May 1 of 
each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' On Loyalty Day, we honor our Nation and 
remember with pride the courageous individuals who help keep it safe and 
strong and who honor its legacy of freedom and equal opportunity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2009, as Loyalty Day. I call upon all 
the people of the United States to join in support of this national 
observance and to display the flag of the United States on Loyalty Day.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8369 of May 1, 2009

Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The vast diversity of languages, religions, and cultural traditions of 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders continues to strengthen the fabric 
of American society. From the arrival of the first Asian American and 
Pacific Islander immigrants 150 years ago to those who arrive today, as 
well as those native to the Hawaiian Islands and to our Pacific Island 
territories, all possess the common purpose of the fulfilling the 
American dream and leading a life bound by the American ideals of life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
During Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we remember 
the challenges and celebrate the achievements that define our history.
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have endured and overcome hardship 
and heartache. In the earliest years, tens of thousands of Gold Rush 
pioneers, coal miners, transcontinental railroad builders, as well as 
farm and orchard laborers, were subject to unjust working conditions, 
prejudice, and discrimination--yet they excelled. Even in the darkness 
of the Exclusion Act and Japanese internment, Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders have persevered, providing for their families and 
creating opportunities for their children.
Amidst these struggles, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have 
contributed in great and significant ways to all aspects of society. 
They have created works of literature and art, thrived as American 
athletes, and prospered in the world of academia. Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders have played a vital role in our Nation's economic and 
technological growth by establishing successful enterprises and pushing 
the limits of science. They are serving in positions of leadership 
within the government more now than ever before. And along with all of 
our great service men and women, they have defended the United States 
from threats at home and abroad, serving our Nation with valor.
From the beaches of the Pacific islands and the California coast, the 
grasslands of Central Asia and the bluegrass of Kentucky, and from the 
summits of the Himalayas and the Rocky Mountains, the Asian American and 
Pacific Islander community hails from near and far. This is the story of 
our more perfect union: that it is diversity itself that enriches, and 
is fundamental to, the American story.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2009, as Asian 
American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I call upon the people of 
the United States to learn more about the history of Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders and to observe this month with appropriate programs 
and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8370 of May 1, 2009

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A morning walk in the neighborhood or Saturday game of catch with a 
child can brighten the day. Simple activities like these also contribute 
to our physical fitness. As the weather warms and invites us outside, I 
encourage Americans to consider the many simple ways to add physical 
fitness activities to our lives. Incorporating these habits can put a 
smile on your face, and it can also improve your long-term health and 
well-being.
This issue deserves our attention because physical activity can help 
curtail the rise in chronic diseases facing our Nation today. Among 
children and adolescents, regular physical activity can improve bone 
health and muscular fitness. Physical activity also helps prevent 
childhood obesity, which is a serious threat to our Nation's health. 
Among adults young and old, physical activity has been shown to combat 
obesity, while reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain 
cancers. Even moderate amounts of physical activity can reduce the risk 
of premature death. All Americans should understand the significant 
benefits physical activity provides.
Individuals, employers, and communities can take steps to promote 
physical fitness. Depending on his or her ability, every American can 
try to be healthier by, for example, walking or biking to work if it is 
nearby, being active during free time, and eating healthier meals. 
Employers can raise awareness and incorporate physical activity in the 
workplace, and communities can promote access to recreational activities 
and parks.
The Department of Health and Human Services' Physical Activity 
Guidelines for Americans are designed to help Americans of various ages 
and abilities engage in physical activity that can be incorporated 
easily into their daily lives. More information about the Guidelines is 
available at: www.health.gov/paguidelines.
To encourage attention to physical fitness, the President's Council on 
Physical Fitness and Sports sponsors the National President's Challenge, 
a six-week competition to determine America's most active State. The 
Challenge extends from May 1 through July 24 this year. I encourage 
Americans to register for the Challenge at www.presidentschallenge.org 
and to begin recording activity to help their State win this year's 
competition.
By learning about the benefits of physical fitness, staying motivated, 
and being active and eating healthy, more Americans can live healthier, 
longer, and happier lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2009, as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the American people to 
take control of their health and wellness by making physical activity, 
fitness, and sports participation an important part of their daily 
lives. I encourage individuals, businesses, and community organizations 
to renew their commitment to personal fitness and health by celebrating 
this month with appropriate events and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8371 of May 4, 2009

Older Americans Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Older Americans have carried our Nation through great challenges and 
triumphs. They have enriched our national character and strengthened the 
Republic for those who have followed. During the month of May, we pay 
tribute to the wisest among us.
Throughout the land, older Americans are strengthening our communities 
and the American way of life. Many senior citizens remain in the 
workforce to support themselves and their families. Others are embarking 
on second careers and exploring new interests and fields of knowledge. 
Inspiring citizens of all ages, many serve as advocates and volunteers 
in community service roles. In this important work, they make a real 
difference in the daily lives of fellow citizens of all ages, while 
promoting and strengthening the American spirit of civic participation.
My Administration is working to create opportunities for older Americans 
to share their skills and wisdom with younger generations. One of the 
bills I recently signed into law, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America 
Act, expands and improves service opportunities for older Americans. Our 
Nation can benefit greatly from the experience and hard work of our 
older Americans, and I am committed to providing service opportunities 
to achieve this end.
We owe older Americans a debt of gratitude and must work to help them 
age with dignity. Through home- and community-based services, including 
health promotion and preventive care programs, many older Americans are 
able to live more independent and healthier lives. This year's theme for 
Older Americans Month, ``Living Today for a Better Tomorrow,'' captures 
the importance of helping seniors today so they can enjoy the years 
ahead.
My Administration is committed to supporting older Americans and is 
working to strengthen health care, retirement, community involvement, 
and other programs vital to their interests and beneficial to all of us. 
Older Americans have earned this support, and we owe them nothing less.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2009 as Older 
Americans Month. I invite Americans of all ages; representatives of 
government at all levels; businesses and communities; faith-based and 
neighborhood organizations; and health, academic, and recreational 
institutions to acknowledge the contributions of older Americans during 
this month and throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8372 of May 4, 2009

National Charter Schools Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Improving our schools is the collective responsibility of all 
Americans--business owners and workers, educators and parents, students 
and their communities. We must ensure that all students receive a high-
quality education that delivers the knowledge and skills needed to 
succeed, and that young men and women stay on the path to graduation and 
a life-long commitment to learning.
Many successful public charter schools across the Nation are working to 
meet these goals. Founded by parents, teachers, and civic or community 
organizations, our Nation's public charter schools enjoy broad leeway to 
innovate.
The best public charter schools and their students are thriving in 
States that have adopted a rigorous selection and review process to 
ensure that autonomy is coupled with greater accountability. The growth 
of effective public charter schools benefits our children, and States 
have an important role to play in their expansion.
During National Charter Schools Week, we recognize these public charter 
schools for their dedication and commitment to achievement in education. 
They are models of excellence and are promoting the interests of our 
children, our economy, and our Nation as a whole.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 3 through May 9, 2009, 
as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's successful 
public charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on 
States and communities to support public charter schools and the 
students they serve.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8373 of May 6, 2009

World Trade Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When the world's consumers fly in a U.S.-manufactured airplane, eat a 
steak from America's heartland, watch a Hollywood movie, or visit the 
Grand Canyon, they are helping to create and maintain good jobs for 
Americans.
World Trade Week is an opportunity to reaffirm the benefits of trade and 
to emphasize America's commitment to a global marketplace that creates 
good jobs and lifts up American families. The United States and our 
trading partners stand to gain when trade is open, transparent, rules-
based, and fair, showing respect for labor and environmental standards.
The United States is well-positioned to reap the benefits of trade. 
America is a leader in the global marketplace and ranks at the top of 
almost every measure of global competitiveness. Our businesses, workers, 
and farmers remain the most innovative, productive, and adaptable in the 
world. The United States is also the world's largest exporter.
Trade is a significant and increasingly important contributor to U.S. 
economic growth. Exports accounted for 13 percent of U.S. economic 
activity in 2008, and they support millions of jobs in the United 
States. In difficult economic times, it is even more important for 
American industry to take advantage of every opportunity for export-
driven growth. That is why I will work to open more markets to U.S. 
exports, including in such important job growth industries as energy 
efficiency, clean energy, and health information technology.
Imports can also benefit the United States by increasing consumer choice 
while lowering prices for millions of working families. In addition, 
imports can support employment for retailers, distributors, the 
transportation sector, and domestic manufacturers which rely on global 
supply chains to make products for both the U.S. and international 
markets.
We must ensure that the benefits of trade are spread more widely. This 
can be achieved by training and supporting Americans and ensuring that 
trade agreements provide the economic opportunities that Americans 
deserve. Workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own 
deserve the chance to be retrained for a new economic environment. That 
is one of the reasons I signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009 (ARRA), which improves Trade Adjustment Assistance to help 
families that are struggling now. For the long term, the ARRA also 
invests in an education system that will prepare our children to compete 
and succeed in the global economy.
We will negotiate future trade agreements to create opportunities for 
all Americans. My Administration is committed to building on existing 
trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties in an open and 
transparent manner. In consultation with the American people, the 
Congress, key stakeholders, and our trading partners, I am developing a 
plan of action for pending free trade agreements. I will also work with 
our trading partners to advance a strong market-opening agreement for 
agriculture, industrial goods, and services through the Doha Development 
Round and through other negotiations. Together, we can build a trading 
regime that spreads its benefits among Americans and also benefits 
workers in our partner countries.
Transparency and inclusiveness are central principles we must adhere to 
as we seek to expand trade. When trade agreements are negotiated in 
consultation with the American people, the benefits of trade can be 
understood more broadly. Through open dialogue, the concerns of American 
and foreign workers can be addressed and the environmental consequences 
of trade agreements can be identified and mitigated.
With a transparent, free, and fair framework, we can make trade a 
powerful contributor to the revival of the U.S. and global economies.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 17 through May 23, 
2009, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate 
the benefits of trade to our Nation and the global economy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8374 of May 7, 2009

National Day of Prayer, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our Nation's history, Americans have come together in moments 
of great challenge and uncertainty to humble themselves in prayer. In 
1775, as the Continental Congress began the task of forging a new 
Nation, colonists were asked to observe a day of quiet humiliation and 
prayer. Almost a century later, as the flames of the Civil War burned 
from north to south, President Lincoln and the Congress once again asked 
the American people to pray as the fate of their Nation hung in the 
balance.
It is in that spirit of unity and reflection that we once again 
designate the first Thursday in May as the National Day of Prayer. Let 
us remember those who came before us, and let us each give thanks for 
the courage and compassion shown by so many in this country and around 
the world.
On this day of unity and prayer, let us also honor the service and 
sacrifice of the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. We 
celebrate their commitment to uphold our highest ideals, and we 
recognize that it is because of them that we continue to live in a 
Nation where people of all faiths can worship or not worship according 
to the dictates of their conscience.
Let us also use this day to come together in a moment of peace and 
goodwill. Our world grows smaller by the day, and our varied beliefs can 
bring us together to feed the hungry and comfort the afflicted; to make 
peace where there is strife; and to lift up those who have fallen on 
hard times. As we observe this day of prayer, we remember the one law 
that binds all great religions together: the Golden Rule, and its call 
to love one another; to understand one another; and to treat with 
dignity and respect those with whom we share a brief moment on this 
Earth.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on the 
President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first 
Thursday in May as a ``National Day of Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 7, 2009, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
call upon Americans to pray in thanksgiving for our freedoms and 
blessings and to ask for God's continued guidance, grace, and protection 
for this land that we love.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.
BARACK OBAMA

Proclamation 8375 of May 8, 2009

Military Spouse Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Military spouses share the sacrifices of service with our Nation's men 
and women in uniform. As members of the Armed Forces serve in the United 
States and across the world, military spouses also serve our Nation. 
When a servicemember goes to war, we know their spouse also shares in 
that sacrifice. I am inspired by their commitment to family and our 
Nation, and on Military Spouse Day, we honor these individuals for their 
contributions.
 Wives and husbands of servicemembers display an uncommon courage and 
strength as they steadfastly support their spouses during long and 
arduous deployments. While they endure separations that are filled with 
worry and anxiety, they face unique stresses. Foremost is the concern 
about the safety and well-being of deployed loved ones, but there are 
many other challenges. From managing household finances to comforting 
children impacted by a military parent's absence, military spouses take 
on the burdens of maintaining families largely on their own. This task 
is complicated even more as spouses work to maintain careers and a sense 
of community while moving to new duty stations around the country and 
the world.
Despite these hardships, military spouses are an inexhaustible source of 
strength for our military families and donate their time generously to 
local communities. Military spouses offer the love and encouragement 
that help servicemembers endure the challenges of serving our Nation. 
Military spouses support one another as friends and mentors. They serve 
in family readiness groups to keep fellow spouses informed and to 
provide mutual support. They contribute as volunteers to improve 
neighborhoods, military installations, and communities. These 
contributions strengthen both our Nation's character and its security.
 All Americans should express appreciation for military spouses and let 
them know they are not alone. To help those who need it, friends, co-
workers, and neighbors can offer to help with the burden of daily tasks 
and thus give military spouses more time for themselves and their 
families. To assist spouses who are coping with the absence of a loved 
one, individuals can listen and offer their counsel. Americans can also 
volunteer through the many organizations that provide assistance to 
military families.
 Our Nation maintains a sacred trust with every individual who serves. 
My Administration is committed to showing our Nation's gratitude for 
them by honoring our obligations to their families.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 8, 2009, as Military 
Spouse Day. I call upon the people of the United States to honor 
military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities today and in 
the future.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8376 of May 8, 2009

Mother's Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The time-honored tradition of recognizing mothers grew out of the 
imagination of a few bold women. Julia Ward Howe, composer of The Battle 
Hymn of the Republic, urged mothers to advocate for peace through a day 
dedicated to them. After her own mother passed away, Anna Jarvis sought 
to recognize the great influence mothers have on society. These efforts 
led to the recognition of mothers through a Congressional Resolution and 
President Woodrow Wilson's proclamation of the first Mother's Day in 
1914. Today, we proudly carry forward this tradition in honor of 
mothers, the special women whose love and lessons profoundly impact our 
lives.
Mothers are the bedrock of the American family--vital to their 
children's growth and happiness and to the success of our country. 
Children's lives are shaped by their mothers, whose care provides the 
foundation for their development. Mothers instill the values and 
confidence that help define their children's character and self-esteem, 
and offer a guiding clarity of spirit. Mothers are role models, 
teachers, and sources of unconditional support. There is no substitute 
for the bond of love between mother and child, and nothing is more 
worthy of reverence.
Across America, mothers raise children under an array of circumstances. 
They may care for a child with the help of a spouse, family members, and 
friends, or they may do this job alone as a single parent. They may be 
biological mothers, adoptive mothers, or foster mothers, but all open 
their hearts to their children and nurture them through their life 
journey. Caring for children also means putting food on the table, 
ensuring their needs are met, and staying involved in their daily lives. 
Women often work long hours at demanding jobs and then return home to a 
household with myriad demands. Balancing work and family is no easy 
task, but mothers across our Nation meet this challenge each day, often 
without recognition for their hard work and dedication. The strength and 
conviction of all mothers--including those who work inside and outside 
the home--are inspiring. They deserve our deepest respect, admiration, 
and appreciation.
A mother's love is a cherished blessing, for it is selfless, 
unconditional, and true. This Mother's Day, let us honor our mothers who 
continue to inspire us, and remember those whose loving spirits sustain 
us still.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), 
has designated the second Sunday in May each year as ``Mother's Day'' 
and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 10, 2009, as Mother's Day. I urge all 
Americans to express their love, respect, and gratitude to mothers 
everywhere, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8377 of May 11, 2009

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, Americans rely on roads, rails, ports, and airports to get to 
work and to transport goods and services. At the same time, the United 
States Armed Forces rely on our transportation infrastructure to move 
personnel and supplies. During National Transportation Week and on 
National Defense Transportation Day, we underscore the importance of the 
transportation system to our Nation's economy and security. We also 
honor the dedicated professionals who build, maintain, and operate our 
transportation infrastructure.
From rural roads to state-of-the-art intermodal facilities, 
transportation infrastructure is crucial to economic growth. Goods and 
services flow constantly across land, water, and sky, and our most 
efficient modes of travel save businesses and consumers money, and can 
reduce impacts on our environment. To compete in the 21st century global 
economy, the United States must have an advanced transportation system.
Securing America's energy future and maintaining our national defense 
also require a robust transportation system. Whether responding to 
natural disasters at home or mobilizing resources to defend America 
abroad, transportation is vital to keeping Americans safe. Global 
climate change and our reliance on foreign oil have also created 
tremendous national security challenges. To solve these problems and 
create new economic opportunities, we must make our transportation 
system cleaner and more efficient.
My Administration has taken bold action to rebuild our Nation's 
crumbling infrastructure. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
integrates the goals of job creation and economic growth with a renewed 
commitment to transportation. This legislation will fund projects to 
improve public transportation, repair highways and roads, modernize 
airports and seaports, and invest in renewable energy, all while 
creating or saving hundreds of thousands of jobs.
To make the most of every taxpayer dollar, my Administration is working 
side-by-side with State and local governments and the private sector to 
provide oversight and to closely monitor these transportation 
investments.
The women and men who support this critical sector every day make this 
plan possible. Renewing America's transportation system is an historic 
task, and I am convinced they will rise to the challenge.
The Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, 
as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the third 
Friday in May of each year as ``National Defense Transportation Day,'' 
and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 
133), that the week during which that Friday falls be designated as 
``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 15, 2009, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 10 through May 16, 2009, as National 
Transportation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the 
importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure and to 
acknowledge the contributions of those who build, operate, and maintain 
it.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.
BARACK OBAMA

Proclamation 8378 of May 11, 2009

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, peace officers put on their uniforms and go to work to 
safeguard America's communities and uphold the freedoms we hold dear. 
This week we honor their contributions and sacrifice.
Law enforcement officers routinely place themselves in harm's way to 
protect people they do not and will not know. They serve willingly and 
devotedly, and their commitment is essential for us to maintain a 
healthy quality of life, a strong economy, the safety of our families, 
and a robust national security system.
My Administration is working to keep Americans safe and to strengthen 
the Federal partnership with America's peace officers. The American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which I recently signed, makes $4 billion 
available for State and local law enforcement. This provision will save 
or create thousands of law enforcement jobs across the country through 
the revitalized Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Recovery 
Program. The Recovery Act also provides $2 billion through the Edward 
Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program. These measures will put 
more officers on the street and help those already serving to perform 
their jobs more effectively.
The benefits that peace officers provide come with great sacrifice. 
Every year, many give their lives in the performance of their duties. 
Their contributions live on in the communities they strengthened, and 
their service will never be forgotten. This week, as we recognize their 
commitment to duty, we renew our pledge to support their families and 
colleagues.
The President has been requested to designate May 15 of each year as 
Peace Officers Memorial Day in honor of all Federal, State, and local 
officers killed or disabled in the line of duty, and to designate that 
week as Police Week in recognition of their service given to the United 
States (36 U.S.C. 136-37).
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2009, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 10 through May 16, 2009, as Police Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. I also call on Governors of the United States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject 
to the jurisdiction of the United States, and appropriate officials of 
all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half staff 
on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to 
display the flag at half staff from their homes and businesses on that 
day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8379 of May 12, 2009

Jewish American Heritage Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Jewish American tradition exemplifies the strength of the American 
immigrant tradition. Since Jews arrived in New Amsterdam in 1654, Jewish 
Americans have maintained a unique identity just as they have enmeshed 
themselves in the fabric of the United States. This month we celebrate 
this inspiring and unifying narrative.
Jewish Americans across the United States practice the faith and 
celebrate the culture of their ancestors. Across the Nation every day, 
individuals emulate their forebears by seeking to perform mitzvot, the 
hundreds of commandments set forth in the Torah. The term ``mitzvah'' 
has come to mean ``good deed,'' and many Jews have adopted these 
practices to serve their communities. Other mitzvot include observing 
holidays, such as Passover, which marks the exodus from Egypt; and Yom 
Kippur, a time to contemplate and seek forgiveness for the sins of the 
past year; and Shabbat, the weekly day of rest.
The focus on preserving traditions is a notable characteristic of Jewish 
culture. Many Jewish religious and cultural practices have developed and 
adapted over the millennia, yet the fundamental exhortation to ensure 
that long-cherished ways of life are passed on to future generations 
remains as strong as ever before. Many Jewish Americans carry on this 
belief as they instill these traditions in their children.
Seeking to preserve their culture and start anew, Jewish immigrants have 
departed familiar lands to pursue their own American dreams for more 
than 300 years. During some periods, Jews sought refuge in the United 
States from the horrors and tragedies of persecution, pogroms, and the 
Holocaust. During other times, they came to seek better lives and 
greater economic opportunities for themselves and their children.
Jewish Americans have immeasurably enriched our Nation. Unyielding in 
the face of hardship and tenacious in following their dreams, Jewish 
Americans have surmounted the challenges that every immigrant group 
faces, and have made unparalleled contributions. Many have broken new 
ground in the arts and sciences. Jewish American leaders have been 
essential to all branches and levels of government. Still more Jewish 
Americans have made selfless sacrifices in our Armed Forces. The United 
States would not be the country we know without the achievements of 
Jewish Americans.
Among the greatest contributions of the Jewish American community, 
however, is the example they have set for all Americans. They have 
demonstrated that Americans can choose to maintain cultural traditions 
while honoring the principles and beliefs that bind them together as 
Americans. Jewish American history demonstrates how America's diversity 
enriches and strengthens us all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2009 as Jewish 
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate the 
proud heritage of Jewish Americans with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8380 of May 14, 2009

Armed Forces Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 On Armed Forces Day, 1961, President Kennedy connected civic engagement 
and our Nation's security. He stated, ``the strength of our armed forces 
rests not alone upon their active and reserve members, our industrial 
productivity, and our human resources, but also upon the understanding 
and support of an informed American people.'' Based on this perspective, 
I call upon all Americans to learn more about, and express gratitude 
for, the heroic efforts of our men and women in uniform.
 Today, the United States military serves across the world to keep us 
safe. They are working here at home to protect America from threats 
foreign and domestic; they are risking their lives in the deserts of 
Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan; and they are also serving bravely 
in many other parts of the world to ensure our security and provide 
humanitarian assistance. Members of the Armed Forces are forging a 
better future for our Nation and the world.
 As they carry out their missions, military families endure the 
sacrifice of their absence. Worrying about their safety, moving to new 
duty stations, and managing a home without a loved one, these families 
shoulder great burdens as they help sustain our men and women in 
uniform. I thank military families for their vital contributions.
 The Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coastguardsmen who have 
answered the call to service deserve recognition and gratitude. They 
have endured the most difficult of conditions to protect America and her 
highest ideals. Today, I ask all Americans to know their sacrifice and 
join me in humble thanks.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United 
States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby 
proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.
 I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air 
Force, Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of 
the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each year, with the 
Secretary of Defense responsible for soliciting the participation and 
cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.
 I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to 
provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction 
each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public 
understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States.
 I also invite national and local veterans, civic and other 
organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.
 Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United 
States at their homes on Armed Forces Day and urge citizens to learn 
more about military service by attending and participating in the local 
observances of the day. I also encourage Americans to volunteer at 
organizations that provide support to our troops.
 Proclamation 7562 of May 16, 2002, is hereby superseded.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8381 of May 15, 2009

National Safe Boating Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, millions of Americans take to our Nation's waterways for 
recreational boating. Whether paddling down a rushing river or cruising 
on a serene lake, boaters are attracted to the incomparable feeling of 
being out on the water. They also are drawn by opportunities to 
exercise, appreciate nature, enjoy quiet solitude, or relax with family 
and friends.
Unfortunately, accidents can occur as Americans participate in this 
popular pastime. Many serious incidents are preventable, and during 
National Safe Boating Week, I ask Americans to learn more about how to 
enjoy our Nation's waters safely and responsibly.
Simple steps can greatly reduce the chances of an accident. In 
preparation for the boating season, Americans can take boating safety 
courses and get a free vessel safety check. These steps can help prevent 
problems before they happen and prepare boaters for problems that may 
occur while on the water. Boaters should also wear a Coast Guard-
approved life jacket and never boat under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol. These critical precautions can save lives and help ensure a 
fulfilling experience.
Each year during this week, the United States Coast Guard partners with 
organizations to educate and inform the public about safe boating. I 
join them in calling upon Americans to protect themselves and others 
while boating.
Recognizing the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has 
authorized and requested the President to annually proclaim the 7-day 
period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 2009, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans to join in observing this 
occasion by learning more about boating safety and committing themselves 
to safe practices on the water.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8382 of May 15, 2009

Small Business Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The entrepreneurial spirit lies at the core of our Nation's economy and 
identity. If Americans with good ideas can work hard, put their plan to 
the test, and succeed, the American economy will continue to create jobs 
and lead the world in innovation and productivity. During National Small 
Business Week, we honor the entrepreneurs and small business owners who 
are the engine of our economy. Their ingenuity and hard work are 
critical to our Nation's prosperity.
Small businesses are the lifeblood of cities and towns across the 
country. Over the last decade, small businesses created 70 percent of 
new jobs, and they are responsible for half of all jobs in the private 
sector. They also help enhance the lives of our citizens by improving 
our quality of life and creating personal wealth. Small businesses will 
lead the way to prosperity, particularly in today's challenging economic 
environment.
My Administration is committed to economic policies that encourage 
enterprise and make America the best place in the world to do business. 
To support the free flow of credit, I have worked to increase loan 
guarantees, reduce borrowing fees, quicken loan processing, and unlock 
the secondary markets that support small business lending, among other 
measures. I also support tax policies that promote investment in small 
businesses, as well as health care reform that will help these 
businesses provide more workers with quality health care services.
Our Nation's success depends on America's small businesses and 
entrepreneurs. Their contributions are necessary to rebuild our economy 
so that it once again offers the opportunity to succeed to all who seek 
it. This week we thank small business owners, entrepreneurs, and 
employees for helping America achieve that promise.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 17 through May 23, 
2009, as National Small Business Week. I call upon Government officials, 
industry leaders, and advocates across the Nation to encourage our 
citizens to celebrate the achievements of small business owners and 
encourage the creation of new businesses.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8383 of May 20, 2009

Emergency Medical Services Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Emergency medical services providers rush into scenes of uncertainty 
and fear, and they help establish order and calm--and save lives in the 
process. They include educators, 911 dispatchers, first responders, 
emergency medical technicians, paramedics, nurses, physicians, and many 
others. These highly skilled teams respond to emergencies 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week.
 When Americans find themselves in unexpected life-threatening 
situations, emergency medical services (EMS) providers provide rapid 
help. Quality emergency medical care dramatically improves the survival 
and recovery prospects for those who experience sudden injury or 
illness. These EMS teams play a vital role in our Nation's overall 
health and safety, as well as our preparedness for pandemic disease and 
disasters both natural and man-made.
 Emergency medical services providers hail from a variety of backgrounds 
and circumstances. They work in rural volunteer fire departments, urban 
hospitals, along our coastal waterways, and among fire-prone western 
forests. Many spend their off-duty time obtaining extra training and 
enhancing their lifesaving skills. All share a common aspiration to help 
those in need, and during Emergency Medical Services Week, we express 
our appreciation for their critical work.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 17 through May 23, 
2009, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Americans to 
observe this occasion by sharing their support with local EMS workers 
and taking steps to improve their personal safety and preparedness.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8384 of May 20, 2009

National Maritime Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans have long looked to the sea as a source of security and 
prosperity. Bounded by two oceans and the Gulf of Mexico, and criss-
crossed by a myriad of inland waterways, America's destiny as a maritime 
nation was a story foretold.
The Merchant Marine took up arms alongside the Continental Navy to help 
defeat the British Navy during the American Revolution. Since then, they 
have served bravely as the United States has faced threats ranging from 
war to piracy, and our seafaring fleet has proven instrumental in 
protecting our safety. In times of conflict and crisis, the Armed Forces 
rely on the Merchant Marine's sealift capability to transport critical 
equipment and supplies. Time and again, mariners have demonstrated their 
willingness and ability to meet daunting challenges.
Waterways have also enabled much of the commerce that has expanded 
America's economy. Domestic and international commerce occurred along 
rivers and coasts even before our Nation's birth. Great cities have 
sprouted near waterways, and maritime activity remains crucial to our 
economy today.
The men and women of the U.S. Merchant Marine and the many other workers 
who have supported the maritime industry have made significant 
contributions to our leadership in the global marketplace, and to our 
security.
On this National Maritime Day, we also mark the opening of a permanent 
exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution, ``On the Water.'' It 
demonstrates the importance of the maritime industry and chronicles our 
history as a maritime nation.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day'' and has 
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2009, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance by 
honoring the service of merchant mariners and by displaying the flag of 
the United States at their homes and in their communities. I also 
request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on 
that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8385 of May 22, 2009

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 For over two centuries, Americans have defended our Nation's security 
and protected our founding principles of democracy and equal justice 
under law. On Memorial Day, we honor those who have paid the ultimate 
price in defense of these freedoms.
 Members of the United States Armed Forces have placed our Nation's 
safety before their own for generations. From the first shots fired at 
Lexington and Concord to the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
these brave patriots have taken on great risks to keep us safe, and they 
have served with honor and distinction. All Americans who have enjoyed 
the blessings of peace and liberty remain in their debt.
 As we remember the selfless service of our fallen heroes, we pray for 
God's grace upon them. We also pray for all of our military personnel 
and veterans, their families, and all those who have lost loved ones in 
the defense of our freedom and safety.
 Today, as we commend their deeds, we also bear a heavy burden of 
responsibility to ensure that their sacrifices will not have been in 
vain. This means that, as we uphold the ideals for which many have given 
their last full measure of devotion, the United States must never waver 
in its determination to defend itself, to be faithful in protecting 
liberty at home and abroad, and to pursue peace in the world.
 In respect for their dedication and service to America, the Congress, 
by a joint resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 
116), has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the 
people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the 
people of the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by 
Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day 
as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National 
Moment of Remembrance.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 25, 2009, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I urge the press, 
radio, television, websites, and all other media to participate in these 
observances. I also request the Governors of the United States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units 
of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon 
on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels 
throughout the United States, and in all areas under its jurisdiction 
and control. I also request the people of the United States to display 
the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon 
period.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
third.
BARACK OBAMA

Proclamation 8386 of May 26, 2009

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, hurricanes threaten the safety of American families in 
coastal and inland communities. These powerful storms can cause heavy 
rainfall, high winds, tornadoes, and storm surges, which can in turn 
bring severe flooding, power outages, damage to homes and businesses, 
and loss of life.
Awareness and preparation are critical to surviving and recovering from 
hurricanes. During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, I call on all 
Americans--including private citizens and those working in government, 
business, and the nonprofit sector--to plan ahead and help secure the 
safety and property of those who face advancing storms.
Americans can take basic steps before a hurricane arrives. The Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the National Hurricane Center recommend 
developing a family disaster plan, creating and maintaining a disaster 
supply kit, securing one's home, and designating a safe place to go 
during a storm. Throughout a storm, individuals should always remain 
aware of weather conditions. More information on precautionary measures 
is available at www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/intro.shtml.
Organizations at the local, State, and national level play important 
roles to protect Americans from the effects of hurricanes. Rescue and 
relief organizations, the private sector, and the news media work to 
meet demands that emerge before, during, and after a hurricane. Among 
other services, they distribute safety information and help coordinate 
relief activities. My Administration is committed to strengthening these 
efforts and is working every day to prepare for hurricanes and their 
potential impacts on everyone in the United States.
The threat hurricanes pose to lives and property cannot be eliminated, 
but preparedness can reduce the dangers these storms pose for our 
families and communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States do hereby proclaim May 24 through May 30, 
2009, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government 
agencies, private organizations, media, community groups, schools, and 
residents of hurricane-prone areas to share information about hurricane 
preparedness and response to help protect communities and save lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.
BARACK OBAMA

Proclamation 8387 of June 1, 2009

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Forty years ago, patrons and supporters of the Stonewall Inn in New 
York City resisted police harassment that had become all too common for 
members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. 
Out of this resistance, the LGBT rights movement in America was born. 
During LGBT Pride Month, we commemorate the events of June 1969 and 
commit to achieving equal justice under law for LGBT Americans.
 LGBT Americans have made, and continue to make, great and lasting 
contributions that continue to strengthen the fabric of American 
society. There are many well-respected LGBT leaders in all professional 
fields, including the arts and business communities. LGBT Americans also 
mobilized the Nation to respond to the domestic HIV/AIDS epidemic and 
have played a vital role in broadening this country's response to the 
HIV pandemic.
 Due in no small part to the determination and dedication of the LGBT 
rights movement, more LGBT Americans are living their lives openly today 
than ever before. I am proud to be the first President to appoint openly 
LGBT candidates to Senate-confirmed positions in the first 100 days of 
an Administration. These individuals embody the best qualities we seek 
in public servants, and across my Administration--in both the White 
House and the Federal agencies--openly LGBT employees are doing their 
jobs with distinction and professionalism.
 The LGBT rights movement has achieved great progress, but there is more 
work to be done. LGBT youth should feel safe to learn without the fear 
of harassment, and LGBT families and seniors should be allowed to live 
their lives with dignity and respect.
 My Administration has partnered with the LGBT community to advance a 
wide range of initiatives. At the international level, I have joined 
efforts at the United Nations to decriminalize homosexuality around the 
world. Here at home, I continue to support measures to bring the full 
spectrum of equal rights to LGBT Americans. These measures include 
enhancing hate crimes laws, supporting civil unions and Federal rights 
for LGBT couples, outlawing discrimination in the workplace, ensuring 
adoption rights, and ending the existing ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' 
policy in a way that strengthens our Armed Forces and our national 
security. We must also commit ourselves to fighting the HIV/AIDS 
epidemic by both reducing the number of HIV infections and providing 
care and support services to people living with HIV/AIDS across the 
United States.
 These issues affect not only the LGBT community, but also our entire 
Nation. As long as the promise of equality for all remains unfulfilled, 
all Americans are affected. If we can work together to advance the 
principles upon which our Nation was founded, every American will 
benefit. During LGBT Pride Month, I call upon the LGBT community, the 
Congress, and the American people to work together to promote equal 
rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2009 as Lesbian, Gay, 
Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to turn back discrimination and prejudice everywhere it 
exists.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8388 of June 1, 2009

Great Outdoors Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 The United States is blessed with unparalleled natural beauty. From 
remote forests to urban parks, these spaces have inspired visitors for 
generations. Today, these areas continue to raise the human spirit in 
those who experience them. During the month of June, I encourage 
Americans to pay tribute to and preserve the great outdoors.
 Americans of all ages can find calm and enjoyment in our Nation's vast 
outdoors. Those desiring quiet or solitude can explore one of our many 
National Parks, which offer tranquil and pristine surroundings. Those 
seeking recreation can also explore public lands, or they can simply 
run, bicycle, or fish in areas close to their homes. Whether near or 
far, the outdoors offers unique experiences.
 Exploring the great outdoors can also help improve one's health. These 
spaces provide countless venues for walking, hiking, running, swimming, 
and boating, among other activities. Americans can combine the enjoyment 
of being outside with the exercise we all need to stay healthy.
 My Administration is working to connect America's youth with our 
treasured landscapes, which should be viewed as classrooms for 
environmental education and gateways to careers in natural resources. 
These efforts will include outreach to those who typically lack 
representation in, and exposure to, these fields. The Department of the 
Interior is launching a summer mentoring initiative as part of this 
effort. This program invites families and friends to teach children 
about the joys and wonders of the outdoors. My Administration is also 
increasing the number of youth involved in national service on public 
lands. Through AmeriCorps and other programs and partnerships, we can 
continue our Nation's proud tradition of service and respect for the 
environment.
 Americans are fortunate to have so many beautiful natural wonders and 
open spaces. I encourage all in our Nation to enjoy these resources and 
to help protect them for future generations. Together, we can carry 
forward our Nation's proud tradition of admiration and preservation of 
the great outdoors.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2009 as Great 
Outdoors Month. I encourage all Americans to spend more time outside and 
to participate in the nationwide events marking this occasion.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8389 of June 2, 2009

African-American Music Appreciation Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The legacy of African-American composers, singers, songwriters, and 
musicians is an indelible piece of our Nation's culture. Generations of 
African Americans have carried forward the musical traditions of their 
forebears, blending old styles with innovative rhythms and sounds. They 
have enriched American music and captured the diversity of our Nation. 
During African-American Music Appreciation Month, we honor this rich 
heritage.
 This legacy tells a story of ingenuity and faith. Amidst the injustice 
of slavery, African Americans lifted their voices to the heavens through 
spirituals. This religious music united African Americans and helped 
sustain them through one of the darkest periods in our Nation's history. 
Years later, spirituals contributed to the advent of a new form of 
music: gospel. Both styles incorporated elements of African music and 
were rooted in faith.
The African-American music tradition also reflects creativity and 
individualism. Blues, jazz, soul, and rock and roll synthesize various 
musical traditions to create altogether new sounds. Their novel chord 
progressions, improvisation, and mood showcase individual musicians 
while also creating a cohesive musical unit. In addition, African-
American composers have thrived in traditional genres such as musical 
theater, opera, classical symphony, and choral music, providing their 
unique imprint and creatively growing these forms of music. All of these 
contributions are treasured across America and the world.
During African-American Music Appreciation Month, we recall the known 
and unknown musicians who helped create this musical history. Their 
contributions help illuminate the human experience and spirit, and they 
help us reflect on our Nation's ongoing narrative.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2009 as African-
American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month 
with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and foster 
appreciation of music which is composed, arranged, and performed by 
African Americans.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8390 of June 2, 2009

National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Caribbean Americans have made lasting contributions to our Nation's 
culture and history, and the month of June has been set aside to honor 
their cultural, linguistic, ethnic, and social diversity.
 Generations of immigrants have preserved the traditions of their 
homelands, and these traditions have defined our Nation's identity. 
Caribbean Americans bring a unique and vibrant culture. This 
multilingual and multiethnic tradition has strengthened our social 
fabric and enriched the diversity of our Nation.
Millions of individuals in the United States have Caribbean roots. 
Unfortunately some Caribbean Americans were forced to our country as 
slaves; others arrived of their own volition. All have sought the 
promise of a brighter tomorrow for themselves and their children.
 In their pursuit of success, Caribbean Americans exhibit the traits all 
Americans prize: determination, a devotion to community, and patriotism. 
They have made their mark in every facet of our society, from art to 
athletics and science to service. Caribbean Americans have also 
safeguarded our Nation in the United States Armed Forces.
 This month we also recognize the critical relationship the United 
States maintains with Caribbean nations. In a world of increasing 
communication and connectivity, this friendship has become even more 
important. We are neighbors, partners, and friends; we share the same 
aspirations for our children; and we strive for the very same freedoms. 
Together, we can meet the common challenges we face.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2009 as National 
Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I urge all Americans to commemorate 
this month by learning more about the history and culture of Caribbean 
Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8391 of June 11, 2009

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the midst of a war for our Nation's independence, on June 14, 1777, 
the Second Continental Congress adopted a flag as a symbol of our 
fledgling Union. The Congress resolved that the flag be ``thirteen 
stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, 
white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.'' For 
generations to come, this pattern would serve as a compass bearing 
toward equality and justice for all.
Our flag's journey has been long. It has seen our Nation through war and 
peace, triumph and tragedy. It flew above the walls of Fort Sumter, 
South Carolina, at the outset of the Civil War. It stood on Mount 
Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima during World War II. During the 
Civil Rights Movement, determined protesters on the streets of Selma, 
Alabama, proudly displayed its colors. Following the attacks of 
September 11, 2001, Old Glory flew over the southwestern wall of the 
Pentagon and the rubble of the World Trade Center. Today, the men and 
women of the United States Armed Forces bear our flag as they serve 
bravely around the world.
The flag is still more than a historical symbol: it is part of our 
culture. In our schools children pledge allegiance to our flag and 
recite the ideals upon which our Nation was founded. Families sit on 
their front porches under a billowing Stars and Stripes. And each day as 
the flag is raised above military installations and government 
buildings, we are reminded of the great sacrifices that have been made 
in defense of our Nation.
The Stars and Stripes tells our Nation's story and embodies its highest 
ideals. Its display reminds us of America's promise and guides us toward 
a brighter tomorrow.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested the 
President to issue an annual proclamation calling for a national 
observance and for the display of the flag of the United States on all 
Federal Government buildings. In a second joint resolution approved June 
9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), the Congress requested the President 
to issue annually a proclamation designating the week during which June 
14 falls as ``National Flag Week'' and called upon all citizens of the 
United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2009, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 14, 2009, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings during the week, and I urge all Americans to 
observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes 
at their homes and other suitable places. I also call upon the people of 
the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days 
from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 
Stat. 211) as a time to honor America, celebrate our heritage in public 
gatherings and activities, and recite publicly the Pledge of Allegiance 
to the Flag of the United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8392 of June 12, 2009

National Oceans Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Oceans are the Earth's dominant feature. They cover more than 70 percent 
of the planet's surface and affect our lives in a variety of ways. This 
month we celebrate the wonder of the oceans, and we commit to protecting 
and sustaining them for current and future generations.
The oceans are critical to supporting life. From the abyssal plains of 
the Pacific to the shallow coral reefs and seagrass beds of the Florida 
Keys, oceans support an incredible diversity of marine life and 
ecosystems. The base of the oceanic ecosystem provides most of the 
oxygen we breathe, so oceans are critical to our survival. These bodies 
of water also drive weather patterns and affect climate.
Our Nation's economy relies heavily on the oceans. Goods and services 
are transported across them constantly. They support countless jobs in 
an array of industries, including fishing, tourism, and energy. The 
economies of entire regions depend on the oceans.
The United States has been a leader in exploring and protecting this 
critical resource. We have gained new insights into the ocean ecosystems 
through research and monitoring. We have promoted innovative 
conservation efforts, such as setting aside special areas as national 
marine sanctuaries. We have also reduced overfishing, made great strides 
in reducing coastal pollution, and helped restore endangered species and 
degraded habitats.
My Administration continues to build upon this progress, and we are 
taking a more integrated and comprehensive approach to developing a 
national ocean policy that will guide us well into the future. This 
policy will incorporate ecosystem-based science and management and 
emphasize our public stewardship responsibilities. My Administration 
also is working to develop a systematic marine spatial planning 
framework for the conservation and sustainable use of ocean resources. I 
am committed to protecting these resources and ensuring accountability 
for actions that affect them.
During National Oceans Month, we celebrate these vast spaces and the 
myriad ways they sustain life. We also pledge to preserve them and 
commend all those who are engaged in efforts to meet this end.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2009 as National 
Oceans Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the oceans 
and what can be done to conserve them.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8393 of June 18, 2009

Father's Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The journey of fatherhood provides unique and lasting joys. Cradling a 
baby in his arms, a father experiences the miracle of life and an 
unbreakable bond. Fathers imagine a world of possibilities awaiting 
their children and contemplate the privilege of helping them reach that 
expanse of opportunity. As kids grow and mature, they look to their dad 
for a special kind of love and support. Providing these necessities can 
bring great happiness.
Fatherhood also brings great responsibilities. Fathers have an 
obligation to help rear the children they bring into the world. Children 
deserve this care, and families need each father's active participation.
Fathers must help teach right from wrong and instill in their kids the 
values that sustain them for a lifetime. As they encounter new and 
challenging experiences, children need guidance and counsel. Fathers 
need to talk with their kids to help them through difficult times. 
Parents must also help their children make the right choices by serving 
as strong role models. Honest and hard-working fathers are an 
irreplaceable influence upon their children.
Communities must do more to counsel fathers. Family and friends, and 
faith-based and community organizations, can speak directly with men 
about the sacrifices and rewards of having a child. These groups can 
support men as they take on the great challenges of child-rearing. 
Through honest and open dialogue, more men can choose to become model 
parents and know the wonders of fatherhood.
On Father's Day, we pay tribute to the loving and caring fathers who are 
strengthening their families and country. We also honor those surrogate 
fathers who raise, mentor, or care for someone else's child. Thousands 
of young children benefit from the influence of great men, and we salute 
their willingness to give and continue giving. We also express special 
gratitude to fathers who serve in the United States Armed Forces for the 
sacrifices they and their families make every day. All of these 
individuals are making great contributions, and children across the 
country are better off for their care.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 21, 
2009, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the 
Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government 
buildings on this day. I urge all Americans to express their love, 
respect, and admiration to their fathers, and I call upon all citizens 
to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.

Proclamation 8394 of June 29, 2009

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 1. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, 
as amended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(A)), the 
President may designate articles as eligible for preferential tariff 
treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
 2. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary developing countries, except those 
designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in section 
503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to 
competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment afforded 
under the GSP to eligible articles.
 3. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) 
provides that the President may disregard the competitive need 
limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from 
any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of 
the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
 4. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(d)(1)), the President may waive the application of the competitive 
need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act with respect to 
any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain 
conditions are met.
 5. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(d)(5)), any waiver granted under section 503(d) shall remain in 
effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer 
warranted due to changed circumstances.
 6. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(E) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(E)), section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) shall not apply with respect 
to any eligible article if a like or directly competitive article was 
not produced in the United States on January 1, 1995.
 7. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the 1974 Act, and after 
receiving advice from the United States International Trade Commission 
(the ``Commission'') in accordance with section 503(e), I have 
determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles when 
imported from any beneficiary developing country.
 8. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that in 2008 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible 
articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need 
limitations, and I therefore terminate the duty-free treatment for such 
articles from such beneficiary developing countries.
 9. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect 
to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing 
countries.
 10. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the 
advice of the Commission on whether any industry in the United States is 
likely to be adversely affected by a waiver of the competitive need 
limitations provided in section 503(c)(2)(A), and I have determined, 
based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 
and 502(c) (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)) of the 1974 Act, and after giving great 
weight to the considerations in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers are in the national economic 
interest of the United States. Accordingly, I have determined that the 
competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act 
should be waived with respect to certain eligible articles from certain 
beneficiary developing countries.
 11. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that certain previously granted waivers of the competitive need 
limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act are no longer 
warranted due to changed circumstances.
 12. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(E) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the limitation provided for in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) shall 
not apply with respect to subheading 7202.50.00 of the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States (HTS) because no like or directly 
competitive article was produced in the United States on January 1, 
1995.
 13. Section 2004(d)(8)(A) of the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical 
Corrections Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-429, 118 Stat. 2434) amended 
subheading 9804.00.70 of the HTS to provide the tariff treatment for 
certain articles imported by or on the account of returning United 
States residents. I have determined that it is appropriate to make 
conforming changes to note 4 to subchapter IV of chapter 98 of the HTS 
to reflect that amendment.
 14. On June 6, 2003, the United States and Chile entered into the 
United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA), which the Congress 
approved in section 101(a) of the United States-Chile Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USCFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3805 note). 
Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008, exercised authority under the 
USCFTA Act by modifying the HTS to provide for an accelerated schedule 
of duty elimination for specific originating goods of Chile. 
Proclamation 8334 inadvertently omitted modifications to the HTS 
necessary to implement the accelerated schedule. I have determined that 
technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide for the 
intended tariff treatment.
 15. Presidential Proclamation 8332 of December 29, 2008, implemented 
the tariff treatment called for under certain provisions of the United 
States-Oman Free Trade Agreement (USOFTA). I have determined that a 
technical correction to the HTS is necessary to provide for the intended 
tariff treatment.
 16. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions 
of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions 
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.

Proclamation 8395 of July 6, 2009

National Summer Learning Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Like an athlete out of practice, a child who takes long breaks from 
learning can face academic setbacks. This problem is especially 
prominent during the summer, when students may lose more than two months 
of progress. Children must remain engaged to maintain and build upon 
their current academic achievement.
Learning loss can be especially pronounced among low-income children. 
Recent research suggests that unequal access to summer learning 
opportunities helps explain the achievement gap between low-income and 
affluent students. This gap ultimately means that low-income students 
may be less likely to graduate from high school or enroll in college.
High-quality summer learning programs help children catch up, keep up, 
and work ahead. These activities provide students with hours of focused 
time for hands-on learning and creative projects. Participation can 
result in gains in writing, reading, and math skills. Through the arts, 
sports, and other extracurricular activities, summer learning 
opportunities also promote innovation and physical fitness. These health 
benefits are especially important because childhood obesity is at an 
all-time high and children typically gain weight two to three times 
faster during the summer.
Sustained public service can also dramatically impact summer learning 
loss. Students can challenge themselves and others through mentoring, 
environmental projects, and other meaningful volunteer work. Youth and 
their communities both benefit from these activities. Local 
opportunities for service can be found at: Serve.gov.
Families and community members play the most important role in the lives 
of their children. Demands at work and home mean that many parents have 
less time to spend with their children, but this time, care, and 
instruction is critical to children's academic success. Especially 
during the summer, parents should try to find time to read interactively 
with children. When possible, families should visit public libraries, 
tour museums and science centers, and explore the great outdoors. 
Parents can also encourage youth to keep a journal and to practice math 
skills through cooking and games.
Even though summer has arrived, student learning needs do not take a 
vacation. On Summer Learning Day, we highlight the need for more young 
people to be challenged during their time off from school. We also 
express support for local programs, communities, and families that help 
children grow through learning initiatives. Working together, we can 
help students remain engaged and return to school with lithe and limber 
minds.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 9, 2009, as National 
Summer Learning Day. I call upon all Americans to support students as 
they participate in summer learning. I encourage students, parents, 
educators, and the non-profit community to engage in summer learning 
activities so that youth return to school poised for academic 
advancement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of July, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8396 of July 17, 2009

Captive Nations Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Fifty years ago, President Eisenhower issued a call of solidarity to 
peoples across the world living under communist rule. This first Captive 
Nations Week Proclamation expressed concern that too many people lacked 
fundamental freedoms, and it affirmed that the people of the United 
States stood alongside those who yearned to be free. Since this 
declaration, more nations have chosen the path of self-determination and 
respect for basic human rights. Brave American men and women have 
contributed to this story, making great sacrifices while serving in our 
Armed Forces or working in Government, private industry, and other 
organizations.
The Cold War is now consigned to the history books, but the ideals that 
President Eisenhower proclaimed remain vibrant and inspiring today. Just 
as in years past, people still hope to have the freedom and opportunity 
to pursue their dreams. People, young and old, still yearn to speak 
their minds. Citizens still believe governments have an obligation to be 
honest and transparent, uphold the rule of law, and allow civic 
participation.
We regard these universal principles as guiding values, and we stand in 
solidarity with those who aspire to live by them--not only because it is 
right, but also because our Nation's fate is connected to that of other 
nations. In an interdependent world, instability, disease, and hardship 
abroad affect us here at home. Governments that are responsive to the 
concerns of their citizens can better tackle these challenges and 
contribute to a more secure, healthy, and prosperous world.
Nations must advance these values through example. At home and abroad, 
the United States strives to honor the principles enshrined in our 
Nation's founding documents.
The challenges of a new century require us to summon the full range of 
human talents to move all nations forward. The United States stands with 
all governments and peoples committed to unlocking the potential of 
their people, and to peace, the rule of law, and respect for all 
citizens.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution, approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 
212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 19 through July 25, 2009, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to reaffirm 
our commitment to all those seeking dignity, freedom, and justice.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8397 of July 23, 2009

35th Anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) breathes life into the 
timeless ideal, ``equal justice under law.'' It reaches those who cannot 
afford the assistance they need and those who would otherwise go without 
vital representation. Today we recognize the 35 years during which the 
LSC has moved our Nation and our legal system towards greater equality.
The LSC brings legal counsel to every corner of the Nation. As the 
largest provider of civil legal aid to the poor, it supports programs 
that touch families in every State. Persons of all ethnic and racial 
backgrounds know its great work, and women, who represent 75 percent of 
LSC-supported clients, especially benefit from its expertise.
The Legal Services Corporation's work helps improve lives. It allows 
more people to access the public benefits they deserve, more domestic 
violence victims to secure the protections they desperately need, and 
more workers to receive the compensation they have been promised and 
earned.
During an economic crisis, the work of the LSC is especially important. 
When families face foreclosure, eviction, or bankruptcy, or when 
communities are targeted by predatory lenders, they need the help of 
legal professionals. These scenarios are far too common today. 
Fortunately, the LSC stands ready to meet these demands.
Because economically vulnerable communities continue to face an unmet 
need for legal services, my Administration has supported increased 
funding for the LSC. I have also recommended lifting several unnecessary 
restrictions on funding so that more people can receive assistance. 
These changes are critical to the organization's mission and work.
We have made great progress in protecting the legal rights of our 
citizens, and the Legal Services Corporation has played a vital role in 
this story for more than 3 decades. With continued support, it will 
serve those in need and help our Nation live out its highest ideals.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 25, 2009, as the 
35th Anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation. I call upon legal 
professionals and the people of the United States to honor the 
contributions of this vital organization.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.

Proclamation 8398 of July 24, 2009

Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today we celebrate the 19th anniversary of the enactment of the historic 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Signed into law on July 26, 1990, 
this landmark legislation established a clear mandate against 
discrimination on the basis of disability so that people with 
disabilities would have an equal opportunity to achieve the American 
Dream.
Our Nation is once again poised to make history for people with 
disabilities. I am proud to announce that the United States will sign 
the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in New York 
on December 13, 2006. The Convention is the first new human rights 
convention of the 21st century adopted by the United Nations, and it 
represents a paradigm shift in protecting the human rights of 650 
million people with disabilities worldwide. We proudly join the 
international community in further advancing the rights of people with 
disabilities.
As we reflect upon the past and look toward a brighter future, we 
recognize that our country has made great progress. More than ever 
before, Americans with disabilities enjoy greater access to technology 
and economic self-sufficiency. More communities are accessible, more 
children with disabilities learn alongside their peers, and more 
employers recognize the capabilities of people with disabilities.
Despite these achievements, much work remains to be done. People with 
disabilities far too often lack the choice to live in communities of 
their choosing; their unemployment rate is much higher than those 
without disabilities; they are much likelier to live in poverty; health 
care is out of reach for too many; and too many children with 
disabilities are denied a world-class education.
My Administration has met these challenges head-on. We have launched the 
``Year of Community Living'' to help people with disabilities live 
wherever they choose. We have nearly doubled the funding for the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. I was proud to sign the 
groundbreaking Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act and the 
Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act, which provides health 
insurance to millions of additional children. I also lifted the ban on 
stem cell research. These measures demonstrate our commitment to 
leveling the playing field for every person with a disability. My 
Administration will not rest on these accomplishments, and we will 
continue to focus on improving the lives of people with disabilities. I 
encourage States, localities, and communities across the country to 
cultivate an environment in which the 54 million Americans living with a 
disability are valued and respected.
Americans have repeatedly affirmed the importance of protecting the 
human rights and dignity of every member of this great country. Through 
the steps we have taken, we will continue to build on the ADA and 
demonstrate our ongoing commitment to promoting, protecting, and 
ensuring the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
by people with disabilities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2009, as the 
Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I call on Americans 
across our country to celebrate the progress we have made in protecting 
the civil rights of people with disabilities and to recognize the step 
forward we make with the signing of the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Inspired by the advances of the 
last 19 years, let us commit to greater achievements in the years ahead.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8399 of July 24, 2009

National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Fifty-six years after the signing of the Military Armistice Agreement at 
Panmunjom, Americans remain grateful for the courage and sacrifice of 
our Korean War veterans. More than 600,000 United States and allied 
combatants lost their lives in Korea during the 3 years of bitter 
warfare that ended on July 27, 1953. Many were also injured, taken as 
prisoners of war, and missing in action. These dedicated servicemen and 
women, under the banner of the United Nations, fought to secure the 
blessings of freedom and democracy on the Korean Peninsula, and they 
deserve our unending respect and gratitude.
Every day we are reminded of the selfless service of these veterans. The 
Korean War Veterans Memorial stands in our Nation's Capital as an 
enduring tribute to them. Marching among juniper bushes and rows of 
granite, Soldiers, Marines, Sailors, Airmen, and Coast Guardsmen 
silently remind all who glimpse their faces of the great challenges that 
so many Americans overcame. The strong partnership between the United 
States and the Republic of Korea is also a proud testament to our men 
and women in uniform.
Today we remember and honor the valor of Korean War veterans and the 
extraordinary sacrifices that they and their families made in the cause 
of peace.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2009, as 
National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor 
and give thanks to our distinguished Korean War veterans. I also ask 
Federal departments and agencies and interested groups, organizations, 
and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff on 
July 27, 2009, in memory of the Americans who died as a result of their 
service in Korea.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8400 of August 20, 2009

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's strength rests on the ingenuity and creativity of the 
American people. Across our country, almost 4 million minority-owned 
firms exemplify this spirit as they create jobs, develop new products 
and services, and promote community and economic development. The growth 
and expansion of these businesses is an increasingly critical part of 
our economic recovery and long-term prosperity.
At a time when too many Americans are facing extraordinary economic 
challenges, supporting the development of minority-owned enterprises 
will help accelerate the revitalization of our economy. Of the 630,000 
minority-owned employer firms, these businesses are providing employment 
and stability to 4.7 million workers while renewing urban neighborhoods 
and rural communities. They represent a key component of future growth 
for our economy.
Minority Enterprise Development Week is an opportunity to commemorate 
the tremendous value minority entrepreneurs and their employees bring to 
our economy and our Nation as a whole. They embody the timeless American 
values of hard work, integrity, and optimism. They also serve as role 
models to countless children who want to start their own business or 
reach their personal goals. Through their accomplishments and example, 
these leaders affirm that, with determination and commitment, every 
American can achieve his or her potential and live out their dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States do hereby proclaim August 23 through August 
29, 2009, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon all 
Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
and activities to recognize the many contributions of our Nation's 
minority enterprises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8401 of August 21, 2009

Fiftieth Anniversary of Hawaii Statehood

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

It is with great pride that our Nation commemorates the fiftieth 
anniversary of Statehood for Hawaii. On August 21, 1959, we welcomed 
Hawaii into the United States ohana, or family. Unified under the rule 
of King Kamehameha the Great, it was Queen Lili`uokalani who witnessed 
the transition to a Provisional Government controlled by the United 
States. As a Nation, we honor the extensive and rich contributions of 
Native Hawaiian culture to our national character.
Borne out of volcanic activity in the Pacific Ocean, a chain of islands 
emerged that would bear witness to some of the most extraordinary events 
in world history. From Pu`ukohola Heiau and the royal residence at the 
`Iolani Palace, to the USS ARIZONA Memorial and luaus that pay tribute 
to Hawaiian traditions, Americans honor the islands' collective legacy 
and admire their natural beauty. Home to unique and endangered species, 
active volcanoes, and abundant reefs, the Hawaiian islands actively 
conserve their distinctive ecosystems with responsible development and a 
deep-rooted appreciation for the land and surrounding ocean.
The Aloha Spirit of Hawaii offers hope and opportunity for all 
Americans. Growing up in Hawaii, I learned from its diversity how 
different cultures blend together into one population--proud of their 
personal heritage and made stronger by their shared sense of community. 
Our youngest State, Hawaii faces many of the same challenges other 
States face throughout our country, and it represents the opportunity we 
all have to grow and learn from each other.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution 
and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 21, 2009, as 
the Fiftieth Anniversary of Hawaii Statehood. I call upon the people of 
the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8402 of August 25, 2009

Women's Equality Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, our country renews its commitment to freedom and justice for all 
our citizens. As we prepare to celebrate this women's day of equality, 
we reflect on the sacrifices once made to allow women and girls the 
basic rights and choices we freely exercise today. The future we leave 
to our daughters and granddaughters will be determined by our 
willingness to build on the achievements of our past and move forward as 
one people and one Nation. The fight for women's equality is not a 
woman's agenda, but an American agenda.
We honor the resilience, accomplishments, and history of all women in 
the United States. We celebrate the courageous women who fought to 
uphold a fundamental principle within our Constitution--the right to 
vote--and in so doing, protected the cornerstone of our vibrant 
democracy. These visionaries of the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 
sought to ensure that our country lived up to its founding ideals. 
Although only one, Charlotte Woodward, at the age of 81, had the 
opportunity to exercise her newfound right, the struggle reminds us that 
no righteous cause is a lost one. We also commemorate women like Frances 
Ellen Watkins Harper, a poet and lecturer who formed the National 
Association of Colored Women; Antonia Pantoja, a tireless advocate of 
education equality within the Latino community; Sarah Winnemucca, a 
voice for peace within the Native American community; and Patsy Mink, 
author of Title IX and the first woman of color and Asian American woman 
elected to the United States Congress. These women's talents, and the 
contributions of countless others, built upon the framework of 1848 and 
forged paths for future generations.
Our Nation has come a long way since that ground-breaking convention in 
New York. Women have occupied some of the most significant positions in 
government. They have delivered justice from the bench of our highest 
court, fought for our country in foreign lands, discovered cures to 
diseases, and joined the ranks of the greatest business leaders of our 
time. Female college graduates now outnumber their male counterparts. 
Women have sought equality through government, demonstrated by the 
signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, and the 
establishment of the White House Council on Women and Girls. They have 
sought equality through advocacy, exemplified by the efforts of 
thousands of women's organizations. America has made significant 
progress toward becoming the fair and just society the suffragists once 
envisioned.
Yet, today, our work remains unfinished. Far too many adult women remain 
mired in poverty. Women are still subject to pervasive discrimination at 
school and harassing conduct in the workplace. Women make, on average, 
only 78 cents for every dollar paid to men. Underrepresented in many 
facets of our economic and public life, from government to boardrooms to 
the sciences, women have yet to eradicate all barriers to professional 
development.
We stand at a moment of unparalleled change and a time for reflection 
and hope. We cannot allow the vibrant energy and passionate commitment 
of our trailblazing women to fade, and we can never forget the 
responsibility we bear to the ideals of liberty and equality for all. 
Each generation of successful women serves as a catalyst to empower, 
enlighten, and educate the next generation of girls and boys, and we 
must devote ourselves to promoting this catalyst for change now and in 
the future.
On this Women's Equality Day, we resolve to continue the important work 
of our Nation's foremothers and their successors, and turn their vision 
of a more equal America into our reality.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2009, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
celebrate the achievements of women and recommit themselves to the goal 
of true gender equality in this country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8403 of August 26, 2009

Death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Senator Edward M. Kennedy was not only one of the greatest senators of 
our time, but one of the most accomplished Americans ever to serve our 
democracy. Over the past half-century, nearly every major piece of 
legislation that has advanced the civil rights, health, and economic 
well-being of the American people bore his name and resulted from his 
efforts. With his passing, an important chapter in our American story 
has come to an end.
As a mark of respect for the memory of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, I 
hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws 
of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States 
shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public 
buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on 
all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia 
and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions 
until sunset on August 30, 2009. I also direct that the flag of the 
United States shall be flown at half-staff until sunset on the day of 
his interment. I further direct that the flag shall be flown at half-
staff for the same periods at all United States embassies, legations, 
consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military 
facilities and naval vessels and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of

Proclamation 8404 of August 30, 2009

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For generations, education has opened doors to untold opportunities and 
bright futures. Through quality instruction and a personal commitment to 
hard work, young people in every part of our Nation have gone on to 
achieve success. Established by men and women of great vision, 
leadership, and clarity of purpose, Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs) have provided generations of Americans with 
opportunity, a solid education, and hope.
For more than 140 years, HBCUs have released the power of knowledge to 
countless Americans. Pivotal in the Civil Rights Movement, HBCUs offer 
us a window into our Nation's past as well as a path forward. Graduates 
of HBCUs have gone on to shape the course of American history--from 
W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, to Langston Hughes and Thurgood 
Marshall. Today, in twenty States, the District of Columbia, and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, these colleges and universities are serving 
hundreds of thousands of students from every background and have 
contributed to the expansion of the African American middle class, to 
the growth of local communities, and to our Nation's overall economy.
This week, we celebrate the accomplishments of HBCUs and look to the 
future with conviction and optimism. These institutions will play a key 
role in reaching our ambitious national education goals, including 
having the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. 
As our Nation strives toward this goal, we invite HBCUs to employ new, 
innovative, and ambitious strategies to help the next generation of 
Americans successfully complete college and prepare themselves for the 
global economy. During National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week, we recommit ourselves to never resting until equality 
is real, opportunity is universal, and all citizens can realize their 
dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 30 through 
September 5, 2009, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon public officials, educators, and all the 
people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the tremendous 
contributions these institutions and their graduates have made to our 
country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009

To Adjust the Rules of Origin Under the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. In Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, pursuant to 
the authority provided in section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) (the ``1988 Act''), the 
President modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(HTS) to reflect amendments to the International Convention on the 
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the ``Convention'').
2. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the

Act''), incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and 
rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
3. In order to ensure the continuation of the staged reductions in rates 
of duty under the NAFTA for originating goods of Mexico in HTS tariff 
categories that were modified to reflect amendments to the Convention, 
Presidential Proclamation 8097 made modifications to the HTS that the 
President determined were necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty 
reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 6641.
4. Canada and Mexico are parties to the Convention. Because the 
substance of changes to the Convention are reflected in slightly 
differing form in the national tariff schedules of the parties to the 
NAFTA, the rules of origin set out in that Agreement must be changed to 
ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the 
NAFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff 
categories that were modified in Proclamation 8097. The NAFTA parties, 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico, have agreed to make these 
changes.
5. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides 
rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States 
originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for 
the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA. Section 
202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes 
the President to proclaim, as part of the HTS, the rules of origin set 
out in the NAFTA and to proclaim any modifications to such previously 
proclaimed rules of origin, including those necessary to implement an 
agreement with NAFTA countries under paragraph 2 of section 7 of Annex 
300-B of the NAFTA, subject to the consultation and layover requirements 
of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3313(a)).
6. The NAFTA parties have agreed to modify certain NAFTA rules of 
origin. Modifications to the NAFTA rules of origin reflected in general 
note 12 to the HTS are therefore necessary to ensure the continuation of 
tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the NAFTA to 
originating goods in tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and 
to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 6641. The 
consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA 
Implementation Act were met December 10, 2007, with respect to the 
proposed modifications.
7. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed in 
this proclamation pursuant to section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation 
Act are necessary to implement an agreement with the NAFTA parties under 
paragraph 2 of section 7 of Annex 300-B of the NAFTA. In addition, I 
have determined that the modifications pursuant to section 1206(a) of 
the 1988 Act are in conformity with the obligations of the United States 
under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic 
interest of the United States.
8. Certain necessary modifications to the HTS to conform it to the 
Convention were inadvertently omitted from Proclamation 8097. I have 
determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to 
conform the HTS to the Convention.
9. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the 
Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel 
(USIFTA), which the Congress approved in the United States-Israel Free 
Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``USIFTA Implementation 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2112 note).
10. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act provides that, 
whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the 
general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with 
respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim 
such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, 
or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such 
additional duties as the President determines to be required or 
appropriate to carry out the Agreement.
11. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, 
on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with 
Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products 
during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the ``2004 
Agreement''). On December 10, 2008, the United States entered into an 
agreement with Israel to extend the 2004 Agreement through December 31, 
2009, in order to allow for additional time to negotiate a successor 
arrangement to the 2004 Agreement.
12. In Presidential Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent 
with the 2004 Agreement, the President determined, pursuant to section 
4(b) of the USIFTA Act, that it was necessary in order to maintain the 
general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with 
respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free 
access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified 
quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.
13. In Presidential Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008, the 
President determined that it was necessary in order to maintain the 
general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with 
respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA to extend such duty-free 
treatment through December 31, 2009. I have determined that a 
modification to the HTS is necessary to provide the intended tariff 
treatment.
14. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts, affecting 
import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, 
modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other 
import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 3006(c)), provides that any modifications proclaimed by the 
President under section 1206(a) of that Act may not take effect before 
the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation 
is published in the Federal Register.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation 
Act, section 4(b) of the USIFTA Implementation Act, and section 604 of 
the 1974 Act, do proclaim that: (1) In order to reflect in the HTS the 
modifications to the rules of origin under the NAFTA, general note 12 to 
the HTS is modified as provided in Annexes I and II of Publication 4095 
of the United States International Trade Commission entitled, 
``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
to Adjust Rules of Origin Under the North American Free Trade 
Agreement,'' which is incorporated by reference into this proclamation.
(2) In order to make technical corrections to the HTS necessary to 
conform it to the Convention, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex 
III of Publication 4095.
(3) In order to provide the intended duty treatment under the 2004 
Agreement as extended through December 31, 2009, the HTS is modified as 
provided in Annex IV of Publication 4095.
(4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
(5) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annexes I and II of 
Publication 4095 shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the later of (i) 
October 1, 2009, or (ii) the thirtieth day after the date of publication 
of this proclamation in the Federal Register.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8406 of August 31, 2009

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every year, Americans across the country overcome their struggles with 
addiction. With personal determination and the support of family and 
friends, community members, and health professionals, they have turned 
the page on an illness and sought the promise of recovery. On this 
occasion, we recognize these brave role models and express support for 
those in treatment, applaud those in recovery, and encourage those in 
need to seek help.
As a Nation, we must work together to provide access to effective 
services that reduce substance abuse and promote healthy living. Without 
effective treatment, abuse of alcohol, illicit drugs, or prescription 
medications can devastate the mind and body. With treatment, substance 
use disorders can be managed, giving individuals the effective tools 
necessary to address their addiction. This year's theme, ``Together We 
Learn, Together We Heal,'' calls us to unite and encourage drug-free 
living. Treatment programs, family members, and neighbors can all help 
assist those who experience addiction.
During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we also pay 
special tribute to the dedicated professionals and everyday citizens 
who, with skill and empathy, guide people through the treatment and 
recovery process. Across America, they are offering a message of hope 
and understanding. These compassionate individuals remind us that the 
strength of our character derives not from the mistakes we make, but 
from our ability to recognize and address them. When we extend a helping 
hand to those in need, we reaffirm the American spirit and move our 
Nation towards a brighter tomorrow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the virtue of the authority invested in me by the 
Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 
2009 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon 
the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8407 of August 31, 2009

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 Ovarian cancer remains the leading cause of death from gynecologic 
cancer among women in the United States. Every year, thousands are 
diagnosed and go on to fight the disease with grace and dignity. 
National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month honors all those affected by 
this cancer and renews our commitment to fighting an illness that takes 
the lives of too many in our Nation.
 Women are often diagnosed with ovarian cancer when it is already at an 
advanced stage. This problem can be attributed to a lack of effective 
early detection technologies and minimal or no specific symptoms 
associated with the disease. By learning more about risk factors and 
maintaining regular physician consultations, women have their best 
chance of early detection of ovarian cancer.
 Science continues to expand our knowledge about this illness, promising 
hope to those who, years ago, would be without it. Through dedicated 
research, treatment outcomes have improved for many, and we are building 
a foundation for the development of evidence-based screening, which can 
help diagnose the disease at the earliest possible stage when the 
likelihood of cure is high.
 This month we recommit to supporting the women who continue to battle 
valiantly against this malady as well as all families who are affected. 
National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month helps educate women and men 
about the importance of knowing common signs and symptoms, scheduling 
routine doctor visits, and continuing robust scientific research. As a 
Nation, we are united in our resolve to reduce incidence and improve the 
lives of all those affected.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2009 as National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, Government 
agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other 
interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of 
what Americans can do to prevent and control ovarian cancer.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8408 of August 31, 2009

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

 As a Nation, we have made significant progress in the fight against 
prostate cancer. Over the last decade, prostate cancer mortality rates 
have fallen substantially. Yet, despite this progress, among men in the 
United States prostate cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer 
and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. One in six men in this 
country will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. National Prostate Cancer 
Awareness Month is an opportunity to renew our commitment to find better 
ways to prevent, detect, and control this disease.
 Prostate cancer affects both those stricken with the disease and their 
families, often occurring when they least expect it. The cancer does not 
discriminate among husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons, and it does 
not differentiate on race, age, or income. Americans of every background 
know its dangers. Families share in the struggles of prostate cancer, 
bearing the emotional and financial concerns along with the afflicted.
 My Administration supports prevention efforts and research to develop 
better screening tests, uncover more effective treatments, and ensure 
quality care for all who are diagnosed with this illness. We must ensure 
that more men are educated about all aspects of the disease including 
prevention, early detection and possible treatment options. To expand 
our knowledge of this cancer, the National Institutes of Health, the 
Department of Defense, and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention are playing leading roles in research. Their work is helping 
to reduce the burden of prostate cancer and save lives for generations 
to come.
 This month, we remember the lives we have lost, and we recommit 
ourselves to supporting those currently battling against the disease. 
National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month also highlights the great 
medical advancements we have made and reminds us there is still much 
work to be done. As a Nation, we are united in our resolve to reduce 
incidence of prostate cancer and improve the lives of all those 
affected.
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2009 as National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, Government 
agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other 
interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of 
what Americans can do to prevent and control prostate cancer.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8409 of September 3, 2009

National Wilderness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The American wilderness has inspired wonder and imagination for 
centuries and is an irreplaceable part of our Nation's heritage. Even 
before the birth of the United States, visitors from near and far were 
struck by its splendor and purity. The unaltered American landscape 
stood apart from any other in the world. During the years of westward 
expansion, the wilderness frontier became synonymous with pioneer values 
of steadfastness and rugged independence. This month, we celebrate this 
history and renew our commitment to preserving the American wilderness 
for future generations.
Forty-five years ago, the United States achieved a landmark success in 
protecting these magnificent wild spaces. The Congress passed and 
President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wilderness Act, which sought to 
secure ``for the American people of present and future generations the 
benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.'' The Act has been 
widely recognized as one of our Nation's most important conservation 
laws. This law and the National Wilderness Preservation System it 
established have served as a model for wilderness protection laws in 
many of our States and in countries around the world.
The vision and structure established in the Wilderness Act continue to 
receive broad support. This pioneering law created a framework for 
bringing Federal public lands under additional protection. Over the past 
45 years, the Congress has enacted numerous laws extending wilderness 
protection to vast swaths of public lands. These laws have enjoyed 
bipartisan support. Ranchers and anglers, small-business owners and 
conservationists, and Americans of diverse backgrounds have come 
together to preserve many of our Nation's most cherished public spaces.
My Administration has already demonstrated a commitment to protecting 
our wilderness heritage. On March 30, 2009, I signed the Omnibus Public 
Land Management Act of 2009, which established the most recent additions 
to our Wilderness System. As my Administration continues to prioritize 
wilderness protection, we will work closely with the Congress, 
organizations, and private citizens to ensure that all stakeholders can 
make their voices heard. United by a common purpose of preserving our 
precious natural spaces and our wilderness heritage, we will ensure that 
future generations inherit the unique gift of knowing nature's peace.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2009 as 
National Wilderness Month. I call upon all Americans to visit and enjoy 
our wilderness areas, learn more about our wilderness heritage, and 
explore what can be done to protect and preserve these precious national 
treasures.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8410 of September 3, 2009

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

They were daughters and sons, sisters and brothers, mothers and fathers, 
spouses and partners, family and friends, colleagues and strangers. They 
hailed from cities and towns across our Nation and world. On September 
11, 2001, thousands of innocent women and men were taken from us, and 
their loss leaves an emptiness in our hearts.
Hundreds perished as planes struck the skyline of New York City, the 
structure of the Pentagon, and the grass of Pennsylvania. In the 
immediate aftermath of these tragedies, many victims died as they sought 
safety. Selflessly placing themselves in danger, first responders, 
members of the Armed Forces, and private citizens made the ultimate 
sacrifice working to assist others. During the National Days of Prayer 
and Remembrance, Americans across the country cherish the memory of all 
those who passed and honor and pray for their families and friends.
Americans also remember and pray for the safety and success of the 
members of the United States Armed Forces, who work every day to keep 
our Nation safe from terrorism and other threats to our security. 
Military members assisted those in need on September 11, 2001, and serve 
now in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world. They have left the 
safety of home so that our Nation might be more secure. They have 
endured great sacrifice so that we might enjoy the blessings of liberty. 
Our servicemembers represent the best of America, and they deserve our 
deepest respect and gratitude.
The threat of terrorism has denied too many men, women, and children 
their right to live in peace and security. As the United States works to 
defeat terrorists and build a more hopeful future for our children and 
young people across the world, we seek humility and strength. We reflect 
upon the lessons drawn from our national tragedy, seek God's guidance 
and wisdom, and, never forgetting the lost, commit to working in common 
cause with our friends and allies to create a safer and brighter world 
for current and future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 4, 
through Sunday, September 6, as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. 
I ask that the people of the United States, each in their own way, honor 
the victims of September 11, 2001, and their families through prayer, 
memorial services, the ringing of bells, and evening candlelight 
remembrance vigils. I invite the people of the world to share in this 
solemn commemoration.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8411 of September 4, 2009

Labor Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's founding, working Americans have carried us through 
times of challenge and uncertainty and propelled America through eras of 
peace and prosperity. They have long formed the backbone of our Nation's 
economy, and they will continue to lead our Nation to new heights in the 
years to come.
Working Americans helped lay the foundation for our Nation's progress 
over the generations. Brick by brick, they built the infrastructure that 
powered the engine of our economy. With firm resolve and commitment, 
they constructed our cities and towns, and with unparalleled skill they 
manufactured the goods and provided the services needed by Americans and 
people around the world. They have prepared our children for the 
challenges ahead and cared for the sick and the elderly. Today, we 
commemorate the many contributions labor has made to our Nation.
Throughout its history, the labor movement has given voice to the 
aspirations and concerns of millions of men and women. By fighting for 
decent working conditions, as well as fair wages and benefits, organized 
labor has stood for the rights of everyday Americans. With determination 
and commitment, labor has advocated for all working families and all 
have benefited from the fruits of their struggles.
Today, we find ourselves in an era of great challenges. The economic 
crisis we face is vast and complex. Americans understand the 
consequences: dwindling savings for young families, a daunting choice 
between prescriptions and groceries for our seniors, and fading hopes 
for a college education for our young people. Just as they have so many 
times in our history, working Americans will help our Nation emerge from 
this crisis and lead us into a new era of prosperity and progress.
This Labor Day, as we honor our workers, and we renew our commitment to 
uphold the American Dream and the founding promise of our Nation: in 
America, we can make of our lives what we will, and all things are 
possible for all people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 7, 2009, as 
Labor Day. I call upon public officials and all the people of the United 
States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities that acknowledge the tremendous contributions of working 
Americans and their families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8412 of September 4, 2009

National Preparedness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Preparedness is an essential element of a resilient and secure Nation. 
My Administration has made preparedness a top priority, and we are 
working every day to ensure our country stands ready to respond to any 
disaster or emergency--from wildfires and hurricanes, to terrorist 
attacks and pandemic disease. Our goal is to ensure a more resilient 
Nation--one in which individuals, communities, and our economy can adapt 
to changing conditions as well as withstand and rapidly recover from 
disruption due to emergencies.
During National Preparedness Month, we underscore the responsibility of 
individuals, families, and communities--including the private and 
nonprofit sectors--to do their part before an emergency. I urge all 
Americans to take time to prepare an emergency supply kit and a family 
emergency plan, and to educate themselves about potential disasters. I 
also ask Americans to work within their own communities to coordinate 
emergency preparedness efforts. All Americans share this responsibility, 
and we must all work together to safeguard the Nation from harm.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) supports and promotes 
citizen education and grassroots preparedness efforts. FEMA's Ready 
Campaign provides simple and practical steps that all Americans can take 
to protect themselves, their families, and their neighbors. 
Additionally, the Citizen Corps educates, trains, and coordinates 
volunteer activities that help make our communities safer and better 
prepared for emergencies. I encourage all Americans to learn more at 
www.ready.gov and www.citizencorps.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2009 as National 
Preparedness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to 
recognize the importance of preparing for potential emergencies 
beforehand and to observe this month with appropriate preparedness 
activities, events, and training to enhance our national resilience.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8413 of September 10, 2009

Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Through the twisted steel of the twin towers of the World Trade Center, 
the scarred walls of the Pentagon, and the smoky wreckage in a field in 
southwest Pennsylvania, the patriotism and resiliency of the American 
people shone brightly on September 11, 2001. We stood as one people, 
united in our common humanity and shared sorrow. We grieved for those 
who perished and remembered what brought us together as Americans.
Today, we honor the lives we lost 8 years ago. On a bright September 
day, innocent men, women, and children boarded planes and set off for 
work as they had so many times before. Unthinkable acts of terrorism 
brought tragedy, destruction, pain, and loss for people across our 
Nation and the world.
As we pay tribute to loved ones, friends, fellow citizens, and all who 
died, we reaffirm our commitment to the ideas and ideals that united 
Americans in the aftermath of the attacks. We must apprehend all those 
who perpetrated these heinous crimes, seek justice for those who were 
killed, and defend against all threats to our national security. We must 
also recommit ourselves to our founding principles. September 11 reminds 
us that our fate as individuals is tied to that of our Nation. Our 
democracy is strengthened when we uphold the freedoms upon which our 
Nation was built: equality, justice, liberty, and democracy. These 
values exemplify the patriotism and sacrifice we commemorate today.
In that same spirit of patriotism, I call upon all Americans to join in 
service and honor the lives we lost, the heroes who responded in our 
hour of need, and the brave men and women in uniform who continue to 
protect our country at home and abroad. In April, I was proud to sign 
the bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, which recognizes 
September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. Originated by 
the family members of those who lost loved ones on 9/11, the National 
Day of Service and Remembrance is an opportunity to salute the heroes of 
9/11, recapture the spirit of unity and compassion that inspired our 
Nation following the attacks, and rededicate ourselves to sustained 
service to our communities.
Throughout the summer, people of all ages and backgrounds came together 
to lend a helping hand in their communities through United We Serve. As 
this summer of service draws to an end, we renew the call to engage in 
meaningful service activities and stay engaged with those projects 
throughout the year. Working together, we can usher in a new era in 
which volunteering and service is a way of life for all Americans. 
Deriving strength from tragedy, we can write the next great chapter in 
our Nation's history and ensure that future generations continue to 
enjoy the promise of America.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as Patriot Day, 
and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, has requested the 
observance of September 11 as an annually recognized National Day of 
Service and Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2009, as Patriot Day and 
National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, 
agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag 
of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of 
Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives 
as a result of the terrorist attacks against the United States that 
occurred on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United 
States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and interested organizations 
and individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of 
the United States to participate in community service in honor of those 
our Nation lost, to observe this day with other ceremonies and 
activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of 
silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the 
innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8414 of September 11, 2009

To Address Market Disruption From Imports of Certain Passenger Vehicle 
and Light Truck Tires From the People's Republic of China

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On July 9, 2009, the United States International Trade Commission 
(USITC) transmitted to me a report on its investigation under section 
421 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2451), with respect to imports of certain passenger vehicle and light 
truck tires from the People's Republic of China (China). In its report, 
the USITC stated that it had reached an affirmative determination under 
section 421(b)(1) of the Trade Act that certain passenger vehicle and 
light truck tires from China are being imported into the United States 
in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or 
threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or 
directly competitive products.
2. For purposes of its investigation, the USITC defined certain 
passenger vehicle and light truck tires from China as new pneumatic 
tires, of rubber, from China, of a kind used on motor cars (except 
racing cars) and on-the-highway light trucks, vans, and sport utility 
vehicles, provided for in subheadings 4011.10.10, 4011.10.50, 
4011.20.10, and 4011.20.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTS).
3. The USITC commissioners voting in the affirmative under section 
421(b) of the Trade Act also transmitted to me their recommendations 
made pursuant to section 421(f) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2451(f)) on 
proposed remedies that, in their view, would be necessary to remedy the 
market disruption and the basis for each recommendation.
4. Pursuant to section 421(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2451(a)), I 
have determined to provide import relief with respect to new pneumatic 
tires, of rubber, from China, of a kind used on motor cars (except 
racing cars) and on-the-highway light trucks, vans, and sport utility 
vehicles, provided for in subheadings 4011.10.10, 4011.10.50, 
4011.20.10, and 4011.20.50 of the HTS.
5. Such import relief shall take the form of an additional duty on 
imports of the products described in paragraph 4, imposed for a period 
of 3 years. For the first year, the additional duty shall be in the 
amount of 35 percent ad valorem above the column 1 general rate of duty. 
For the second year, the additional duty shall be in the amount of 30 
percent ad valorem above the column 1 general rate of duty, and in the 
third year, the additional duty shall be in the amount of 25 percent ad 
valorem above the column 1 general rate of duty.
6. Section 421(m) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2451(m)) provides that 
import relief under this section shall take effect not later than 15 
days after the President's determination to provide such relief.
7. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the provisions of that 
Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions 
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
sections 421 and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to apply additional duties on imports of the certain 
passenger vehicle and light truck tires from China described in 
paragraph 4, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as 
provided in the Annex to this proclamation.
(2) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, including 
the Annex thereto, shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. EDT on 
September 26, 2009, and shall continue in effect as provided in this 
proclamation and its Annex, unless such actions are earlier expressly 
modified or terminated.
(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8415 of September 14, 2009

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Citizens willing to serve in uniform when duty calls have helped protect 
our freedom and security since our Nation's founding more than 200 years 
ago. During times of peace, they have worked in our cities and towns, 
contributing their skill and energy to local businesses, schools, and 
civic organizations. During times of strife at home and abroad, they 
have served with distinction, protecting the United States from domestic 
and foreign threats. In commemorating National Employer Support of the 
Guard and Reserve Week, we honor the courageous members of our Guard and 
Reserve and their employers, whose support strengthens our Armed Forces 
and helps protect our country.
Our Guard and Reserve personnel are training arduously and serving 
valiantly as they are called upon to meet new challenges. Active here at 
home and in overseas operations, they are a key component in our 
national defense. Members of our Guard and Reserve serve with honor at 
home and in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other regions around the world, and 
they are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. They 
help respond to natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies, and 
protect against threats to our national security. Our Nation owes a debt 
of gratitude to these brave men and women who balance the demands of 
civilian and military life.
Through their continued support and flexibility, employers across the 
country bolster the efforts of members of the Guard and Reserve. 
Employers often make financial and organizational sacrifices in the 
interest of our national security. The commitment of these employers 
helps ensure that our troops are mission-ready and provides a measure of 
assurance, comfort, and pride to those who leave their jobs and families 
behind as they are deployed. The United States is grateful to the many 
businesses and organizations that enable Guard and Reserve personnel to 
remain engaged in both their professional and their military careers.
The United States has always benefited from the contributions of those 
willing to depart the comforts of home to answer the call of duty. 
Today, the American people celebrate the service and sacrifice of 
members of our Guard and Reserve as we pay special tribute to their 
employers for their admirable dedication and support.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 
13 through September 19, 2009, as National Employer Support of the Guard 
and Reserve Week. I encourage all Americans to join me in expressing our 
heartfelt thanks to the members of the National Guard and Reserve and 
their civilian employers. I also call on State and local officials, 
private organizations, and all military commanders, to observe this week 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8416 of September 14, 2009

Fifteenth Anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, we commemorate a milestone in our Nation's struggle to end 
violence against women. Authored by then United States Senator Joe Biden 
and signed into law in September 1994, the Violence Against Women Act 
(VAWA) was the first law to create a comprehensive response to this 
problem at the national level. This landmark achievement has helped our 
Nation make great strides towards addressing this global epidemic.
VAWA sought to improve our criminal justice system's response to 
violence against women and to increase services available to victims. It 
directed all 50 States to recognize and enforce protection orders issued 
by other jurisdictions, and it created new Federal domestic violence 
crimes. The law also authorized hundreds of millions of dollars to 
communities and created a national domestic violence hotline.
This bipartisan accomplishment has ushered in a new era of 
responsibility in the fight to end violence against women. In the 15 
years since VAWA became law, our Nation's response to domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking has strengthened. 
Communities recognize the special needs of victims and appreciate the 
benefits of collaboration among professionals in the civil and criminal 
justice system, victim advocates, and other service providers. With the 
support of VAWA funds, dedicated units of law enforcement officers and 
specialized prosecutors have grown more numerous than ever before. Most 
importantly, victims are more likely to have a place to turn for help--
for emergency shelter and crisis services, and also for legal 
assistance, transitional housing, and services for their children.
Despite this great progress, our Nation's work remains unfinished. More 
families and communities must recognize that the safety of our children 
relates directly to the safety of our mothers. Access to sexual assault 
services, especially in rural America, must be increased. American 
Indian and Alaska Native women experience the highest rates of violence, 
and we must make it a priority to address this urgent problem. We must 
also work with diverse communities to make sure the response to violence 
is relevant and culturally appropriate. We must prevent the homicide of 
women and girls who have suffered from domestic violence, dating 
violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
Far too many women in our communities and neighborhoods, and across the 
world, continue to suffer from violence. Inspired by the promise and 
achievement of the Violence Against Women Act, our Nation stands united 
in its determination to end these crimes and help those in need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the Fifteenth Anniversary 
of the Violence Against Women Act. I call upon men and women of all 
ages, communities, organizations, and all levels of government, to work 
in collaboration to end violence against women.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8417 of September 15, 2009

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The story of Hispanics in America is the story of America itself. The 
Hispanic community's values--love of family, a deep and abiding faith, 
and a strong work ethic--are America's values. Hispanics bring together 
the rich traditions of communities with centuries-old roots in America 
and the energy and drive of recent immigrants. Many have taken great 
risks to begin a new life in the hopes of achieving a better future for 
themselves and their families.
Hispanics have played a vital role in the moments and movements that 
have shaped our country. They have enriched our culture and brought 
creativity and innovation to everything from sports to the sciences and 
from the arts to our economy.
Hispanics have served with honor and distinction in every conflict since 
the Revolutionary War, and they have made invaluable contributions 
through their service to our country. They lead corporations and not-
for-profits, and social movements and places of learning. They serve in 
government at every level from school boards to statehouses, and from 
city councils to Congress. And for the first time in our Nation's 
history, a Latina is seated among the nine Justices of the Supreme Court 
of the United States.
As Hispanics continue to enrich our Nation's character and shape our 
common future, they strengthen America's promise and affirm the 
narrative of American unity and progress.
To honor the achievements of Hispanics in America, the Congress, by 
Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the 
President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 
through October 15 as ``National Hispanic Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2009, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8418 of September 16, 2009

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United States Constitution has withstood the test of time for more 
than two centuries as our Nation's charter of government and the 
guarantor of our liberties. Signed in Philadelphia on September 17, 
1787, this founding document reflects our core values and enshrines the 
truths set forth in the Declaration of Independence, that we are each 
endowed with certain unalienable rights. As the beneficiaries of these 
rights, all Americans have a solemn obligation to participate in our 
democracy so that it remains vibrant, strong, and responsive to the 
needs of our citizens.
To succeed, the democracy established in our Constitution requires the 
active participation of its citizenry. Each of us has a responsibility 
to learn about our Constitution and teach younger generations about its 
contents and history. By fulfilling civic duties, engaging government at 
the local, State, and Federal level, and volunteering in our 
communities, individual citizens can better our country and breathe life 
into the freedoms established in the Constitution.
The right to participate in self-government, and the many other freedoms 
guaranteed by our Constitution, inspire the dreams and ambitions of many 
inside and outside our borders. These principles serve as a beacon of 
hope for Americans and those who seek new lives in the United States. 
Every day, we welcome new and diverse stories and heritages into the 
great patchwork of our Nation. United by our devotion to the 
Constitution and to the civic engagement it inspires, Americans remain 
committed to the fundamental principles established over two hundred 
years ago.
In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 
U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 
108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 
17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2009, as Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2009, as 
Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as 
well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to 
conduct ceremonies and programs that celebrate our Constitution and 
reaffirm our rights and obligations as citizens of our great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8419 of September 17, 2009

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation maintains a solemn commitment to leave no service member 
behind. Our men and women in uniform uphold this pledge every day, and 
our country further upholds it as we honor every man and woman who 
serves, particularly those taken as prisoners of war or missing in 
action. We will never cease in our mission to bring America's missing 
service members home; we will never forget the sacrifices they made to 
keep this Nation free; and we will forever honor their memory. On 
National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we pay tribute to the American men and 
women who have not returned from the battlefield, and we express 
profound gratitude to those who returned only after facing unimaginable 
hardship on our behalf. Today, we also remember the families of our 
prisoners of war and those missing in action and honor the sacrifices 
they have made.
Every day, Americans are working around the world to identify and 
recover the remains of our fallen heroes. It is a promise made, and a 
promise that will be kept. Although their location may be unknown, we 
will not waver in our commitment to see they are reunited with the land 
they so valiantly defended.
For those veterans who returned home after being declared Missing in 
Action or having been imprisoned by the enemy, we honor their service, 
their sacrifice, and their courage. In distant lands, and under wretched 
and torturous conditions, these men and women endured. Faced with such 
tremendous adversity, they embody the power of the human spirit--
sustaining themselves with hope and faith.
On September 18, 2009, the stark black and white banner symbolizing 
America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will be flown over the 
White House, the Capitol, the Departments of State, Defense, and 
Veterans Affairs, the Selective Service System Headquarters, the World 
War II Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial, United States post offices, national cemeteries, and other 
locations across our country. It is a powerful reminder that our Nation 
will never cease in our commitment to honor those who have paid so high 
a price in its service.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18, 2009, as 
National POW/MIA Recognition Day, and I urge all Americans to observe 
this day of honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8420 of September 21, 2009

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's prosperity has been built on the skill and productivity of 
our farmers and ranchers. Two centuries ago, many American families 
toiled in fields and grasslands so that they might feed themselves. 
Today, those in the agricultural sector provide food, fiber, biofuels, 
and many other life necessities for millions across our Nation and 
around the world. The hard work and talent of those in the agricultural 
industry, and continued advances in technology and efficiency, have 
provided great security to the United States.
As they offer great benefits to our Nation, farmers and ranchers also 
face significant risks in the course of their everyday duties. They 
often transport and operate heavy and hazardous equipment and work in 
extreme weather conditions. Farmers may be exposed to pesticides, 
fertilizers, chemicals, and dust that can be harmful to human health. 
They also work in dangerous areas such as wells, silos, and grain 
elevators. These individuals must take great precautions to protect 
their health and safety, especially since rural residents may have to 
travel long distances to receive trauma care for an accident-related 
injury. They must also take particular care to avoid accidents involving 
children.
As the fall harvest season approaches, I encourage farm and ranch 
families and workers to participate in farm safety and health programs. 
I also encourage them to follow optimal farm safety and health 
practices. Businesses and communities, and organizations and neighbors, 
can encourage one another to understand the risks of this work so that 
we can prevent accidents, prevent exposure to potential hazards, and 
save lives.
Working long hours at physically demanding and often dangerous tasks, 
farmers and ranchers provide for our Nation and countless others across 
the world. Even as they have faced risks, they have made our 
agricultural sector more productive and practiced good stewardship of 
our country's natural resources. This week, Americans express gratitude 
for the untold benefits we enjoy from their labor, and we honor their 
achievements by urging continued commitment to the highest standards of 
safety and health.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 20 through 
September 26, 2009, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the people of the United States to join me in celebrating the vital 
contributions of farmers and ranchers to our Nation and in reflecting 
upon the importance of farm safety and health in communities across 
America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8421 of September 22, 2009

National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From atop Pikes Peak to the shores of the James River, Americans 
celebrate the great abundance and utility of our natural resources. 
Since our Nation's founding, hunters and anglers have cherished these 
unparalleled natural gifts and marveled at their untamed beauty. 
National Hunting and Fishing Day recognizes the contributions of 
millions of Americans who continue to engage in these ageless pursuits.
Following in the centuries-old footsteps of the pioneers who walked 
before them, hunters and anglers have played a key role in the 
conservation and restoration of numerous species and their natural 
habitats. They not only understand their pivotal role as stewards of the 
land, but also seek to pass on this honored tradition to future 
generations.
As our citizens continue to enjoy our Nation's natural resources, we 
must remember that this privilege brings great responsibility. Not long 
ago, hunting threatened the extinction of the American Bison, an 
enduring symbol of the American West. Today, their population has 
recovered because of the cooperative efforts of conservationists and 
hunters. Many species, however, still require our protection. We can no 
longer look to our wilderness, as some once did, as land full of 
unlimited bounty and surplus. Recognizing the need for conservation, our 
hunters and anglers have worked hard to manage local ecosystems where 
wildlife remain, as well as to protect those areas where they are slowly 
re-establishing viable populations.
Our national character, always evolving, finds its foundation in those 
timeless American ideals of freedom, fairness, and self-sustainability. 
Today's hunters and anglers bring this spirit to life in the forests and 
streams they visit. If not for America's great hunters and anglers, like 
President Theodore Roosevelt and Aldo Leopold, our Nation would not 
enjoy sound game management; a system of ethical, science-based game 
laws; and an extensive public lands estate on which to pursue the 
sports. On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we celebrate their 
contributions to our natural environment and our national heritage.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 26, 2009, as 
National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon the people of the United 
States to recognize this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8422 of September 25, 2009

Gold Star Mother's and Families' Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The sacrifices of our military servicemembers are etched in the walls of 
our monuments and felt at empty dinner tables across America. To those 
who have given their lives for our country, we honor them as guardians 
of our liberty and pay tribute to their valiant service. As our Nation 
remembers our fallen men and women in uniform, we also recognize the 
profound loss and sorrow of the family members they leave behind.
Few know the honor of service and the costs of war more than Gold Star 
Mothers and Families. They have given our Nation their most precious 
treasure, and we remain forever in their debt. Honoring the memory of 
their lost loved ones, these extraordinary individuals dedicate 
themselves to helping heal the hearts of other military families who 
bear the great burden of loss. Through their strength and service, they 
emulate their loved one's selfless dedication to our country.
On this day, we express immense gratitude and profound respect for Gold 
Star Mothers and Families. Our country's fallen heroes left the comfort 
of home so that we might know a more peaceful world. They endured 
extreme hardship so that we might enjoy freedom. They made the ultimate 
sacrifice so that we might be safe. They represent the best of America. 
In their memory, may we fulfill our solemn obligation to continue their 
work of securing a safer, freer world for generations to come.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold 
Star Mother's Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 27, 
2008, as Gold Star Mother's and Families' Day. I call upon all 
Government officials to display the flag of the United States over 
Government buildings on this special day. I also encourage the American 
people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public 
expression of our Nation's sympathy and respect for our Gold Star 
Mothers and Families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the

Proclamation 8423 of September 25, 2009

National Public Lands Recognition Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Borne out of a commitment to protect and preserve our natural treasures, 
America's public lands are an indispensable component of American life. 
As we work to protect their integrity for future generations, vast 
expanses of land remain available for the use and enjoyment of all who 
visit them. National Public Lands Day is an opportunity for all 
Americans, young and old, to celebrate the majesty of our open spaces 
and devote our collective efforts to conserving our Nation's unique 
landscapes.
Today, from the largest National Parks and Forests to neighborhood 
playgrounds and urban parks, 130,000 volunteers are working on over 
2,000 public land improvement projects across the Nation. Committed 
individuals, including participants from schools and universities, 
private businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies, 
are continuing the American tradition of stewardship through their 
service.
Dedicated to improving all aspects of our natural environment, this 
year's Public Lands Day focuses on water. Across the country, volunteers 
are highlighting the need to protect our Nation's water bodies by 
monitoring water quality in rivers and lakes, restoring wetlands, 
preventing stormwater runoff and erosion, cleaning up trash from 
shorelines, and learning techniques to conserve water at home.
Public lands help preserve our Nation's quality of life, offering fresh 
water, abundant natural resources, and educational and recreational 
opportunities. I was proud to sign the Omnibus Public Land Management 
Act of 2009 to add to our Nation's treasured landscapes and build on our 
rich history as guardians of our natural environment. Today, we affirm 
our resolve to conserve these cherished spaces for our enjoyment and for 
that of future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 26, 2009, as 
National Public Lands Day. I invite all my fellow citizens to join me in 
a day of service for our public lands.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the

Proclamation 8424 of September 28, 2009

Family Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our family provides one of the strongest influences on our lives. 
American families from every walk of life have taught us time and again 
that children raised in loving, caring homes have the ability to reject 
negative behaviors and reach their highest potential. Whether children 
are raised by two parents, a single parent, grandparents, a same-sex 
couple, or a guardian, families encourage us to do our best and enable 
us to accomplish great things. Today, our children are confronting 
issues of drug and alcohol use with astonishing regularity. On Family 
Day, we honor the dedication of parents, commend the achievements of 
their children, and celebrate the contributions our Nation's families 
have made to combat substance abuse among young people.
The 21st century presents families with unprecedented challenges. 
Millions of women and men are struggling to balance the demands of their 
jobs with the needs of their families. At the same time, our youngest 
generation faces countless distractions in their social environment. 
They are coming of age in a world where electronic devices have replaced 
the playground, televisions have preempted conversation, and pressure to 
use drug and alcohol is far too prevalent. Parents bear significant 
stress and burdens to protect their children from harmful influences.
It is our responsibility to talk with adolescents about the risks of 
abusing alcohol, tobacco, or prescription and illicit drugs, and other 
harmful behaviors. These substances can destroy the mind, body, and 
spirit of a child, jeopardizing their health and limiting their 
potential. Active parents, voicing their disapproval of drug use, have 
proven themselves to be the most effective preventative method for 
keeping our children drug-free. A strong and engaged family can make all 
the difference in helping young people make healthy decisions.
By coming together as a family and discussing the events of the day, 
parents can foster open communication, share joys and concerns, and help 
guide their children toward healthy decisionmaking. A strong nation is 
made up of strong families, and on this Family Day, we rededicate 
ourselves to ensuring that every American family has the chance to build 
a better, healthier future for themselves and their children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 28, 2009, as 
Family Day. I call upon the people of the United States to join together 
in observing this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to 
honor and strengthen our Nation's families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8425 of September 30, 2009

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 2009, more than 190,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with 
breast cancer, and more than 40,000 women are expected to die from this 
disease. It is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading 
cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States. As we 
observe National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we salute the brave 
Americans who are fighting this disease, including families and friends, 
advocates, researchers, and health care providers. We also pause to 
remember and pray for those we have lost to breast cancer.
Many Americans know someone who survived breast cancer due to early 
detection or improved treatment, and we must continue to discover ways 
to prevent, detect, and treat this disease. For us to better understand 
how breast cancer develops, to prevent recurrence, and to enhance the 
quality of life for survivors, we must support critical research 
programs. The National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, and 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will invest over $1 
billion in research this year. Strengthening our knowledge of breast 
cancer development can lead to improvements in prevention and treatment.
Screening and early detection are essential to our Nation's fight 
against breast cancer. The National Cancer Institute recommends that 
women age 40 and older have mammograms every 1 to 2 years. Women who are 
at greater risk should talk with their health care providers about 
whether to have mammograms before age 40 and how often to have them. My 
Administration is committed to requiring insurance companies to cover 
mammograms with no extra charges, and prohibiting the denial of coverage 
based on pre-existing conditions, including breast cancer.
Breast cancer health disparities also present a serious challenge. White 
women have the highest breast cancer incidence rates, and African 
American women have higher mortality rates than other racial or ethnic 
groups in the United States. There is also evidence lesbian women are at 
a greater risk of developing breast cancer than heterosexual women. 
Every day, we are improving programs that address the issues women 
encounter in obtaining appropriate and timely treatment. As a Nation, we 
will overcome the financial and physical restraints of underserved 
populations and ensure access to quality health care.
Our Nation has made significant progress in the fight against breast 
cancer, and we remain firm in our commitment to do more. This month, we 
reaffirm our commitment to reduce the burden of breast cancer and our 
support for those who are living with this devastating disease. By 
raising awareness of this disease and supporting research, we can usher 
in a new era in our struggle against breast cancer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2009, as 
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, Government 
agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other 
interested groups to join in activities that will help Americans 
understand what they can do to prevent and control breast cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8426 of September 30, 2009

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Fair access to employment is a fundamental right of every American, 
including the 54 million people in this country living with 
disabilities. A job can provide financial stability, help maximize our 
potential, and allow us to achieve our dreams. As Americans, we possess 
a range of vocational opportunities to make the most of our talents and 
succeed in a chosen career; those with disabilities are entitled to the 
same opportunities. During National Disability Employment Awareness 
Month, we recommit ourselves to implementing effective policies and 
practices that increase employment opportunities for individuals with 
disabilities.
In the past half-century, we have made great strides toward providing 
equal employment opportunities in America, but much work remains to be 
done. As part of that continuing effort, we must seek to provide 
opportunities for individuals with disabilities. Only then can Americans 
with disabilities achieve full participation in the workforce and reach 
the height of their ambition.
My Administration is committed to promoting positive change for every 
American, including those with disabilities. The Federal Government and 
its contractors can lead the way by implementing effective employment 
policies and practices that increase opportunities and help workers 
achieve their full potential. Across this country, millions of people 
with disabilities are working or want to work. We must ensure they have 
access to the support and services they need to succeed.
Recognizing the need for equal employment opportunities, we must also 
strengthen and expand the educational opportunities for individuals with 
disabilities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act substantially 
increased funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 
and provided more than $500 million for vocational rehabilitation 
services, including job training, education, and placement. If we are to 
build a world free from unnecessary barriers, stereotypes, and 
discrimination, we must ensure that every American receives an education 
that prepares him or her for future success.
Each day, Americans with disabilities play a critical role in forging 
and shaping the identity of our Nation. Their contributions touch us all 
through personal experience or through that of a family member, 
neighbor, friend, or colleague. We grow stronger as a Nation when 
Americans feel the dignity conferred by having the ability to support 
themselves and their families through productive work. This month, we 
rededicate ourselves to fostering an inclusive work culture that 
welcomes the skills and talents of all qualified employees.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2009, as 
National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I call on all Americans 
to celebrate the contributions of individuals with disabilities to our 
workplaces and communities, and to promote the employment of individuals 
with disabilities to create a better, more inclusive America, one in 
which every person is rightly recognized for his or her abilities and 
accomplishments.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8427 of October 1, 2009

National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans are constantly adopting new and innovative technologies. This 
exposure has dramatically increased our thirst for computers, 
smartphones, and other digital solutions at work and at home. Our 
Nation's growing dependence on cyber and information-related 
technologies, coupled with an increasing threat of malicious cyber 
attacks and loss of privacy, has given rise to the need for greater 
security of our digital networks and infrastructures. In the Information 
Age, the very technologies that empower us to create and build also 
empower those who would disrupt and destroy. During National 
Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we rededicate ourselves to promoting 
cybersecurity initiatives that ensure the confidentiality of sensitive 
information, the integrity of e-commerce, and the resilience of digital 
infrastructures.
Cyber attacks and their viral ability to infect networks, devices, and 
software must be the concern of all Americans. This month, we highlight 
the responsibility of individuals, businesses, and governments to work 
together to improve their own cybersecurity and that of our Nation. We 
all must practice safe computing to avoid attacks. A key measure of our 
success will be the degree to which all Americans educate themselves 
about the risks they face and the actions they can take to protect 
themselves and our Nation's digital infrastructure.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) support and promote cybersecurity education. Both the 
DHS and the FTC have identified basic cybersecurity tips that every 
computer user should adopt. To learn more about safe computing practices 
that can help prevent cyber attacks, visit www.onguardonline.gov and 
www.dhs.gov/cyber.
The 21st century offers our Nation unprecedented opportunities to 
develop new solutions to the challenges we face. Today, technology 
allows Americans to reach across the globe and communicate with family 
and friends, customers and colleagues, in distant locations. With this 
freedom, however, comes heightened responsibility. My Administration is 
committed to treating our digital infrastructure as a strategic national 
asset. Protecting this infrastructure is a national security priority, 
and in the process, we will ensure that these networks are 
comprehensive, trustworthy, and resilient. Together, we will create a 
more secure America, where technology can evolve in a protected and 
productive environment.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2009 as 
National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and to 
observe this month with appropriate activities, events, and trainings to 
enhance our national security and resilience.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8428 of October 1, 2009

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Domestic violence touches the lives of Americans of all ages, leaving a 
devastating impact on women, men, and children of every background and 
circumstance. A family's home becomes a place of fear, hopelessness, and 
desperation when a woman is battered by her partner, a child witnesses 
the abuse of a loved one, or a senior is victimized by family members. 
Since the 1994 passage of the landmark Violence Against Women Act, 
championed by then Senator Joe Biden, our Nation has strengthened its 
response to this crime and increased services for victims. Still, far 
too many women and families in this country and around the world are 
affected by domestic violence. During National Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month, we recommit ourselves to ending violence within our 
homes, our communities, and our country.
To effectively respond to domestic violence, we must provide assistance 
and support that meets the immediate needs of victims. Facing social 
isolation, victims can find it difficult to protect themselves and their 
children. They require safe shelter and housing, medical care, access to 
justice, culturally specific services, and economic opportunity. The 
Family Violence Prevention and Services Act supports emergency shelters, 
crisis intervention programs, and community education about domestic 
violence.
In the best of economic times, victims worry about finding a job and 
housing, and providing for their children; these problems only intensify 
during periods of financial stress. That is why the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act provides $325 million for the Violence Against 
Women Act (VAWA) and the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). This funding will 
supplement the Federal VAWA and VOCA dollars that flow to communities 
every year, and enable States, local governments, tribes, and victim 
service providers to retain and hire personnel that can serve victims 
and hold offenders accountable. These funds will also bring relief to 
victims seeking a safe place to live for themselves and their children.
Victims of violence often suffer in silence, not knowing where to turn, 
with little or no guidance and support. Sadly, this tragedy does not 
just affect adults. Even when children are not directly injured by 
violence, exposure to violence in the home can contribute to behavioral, 
social, and emotional problems. High school students who report having 
experienced physical violence in a dating relationship are more likely 
to use drugs and alcohol, are at greater risk of suicide, and may carry 
patterns of abuse into future relationships. Our efforts to address 
domestic violence must include these young victims.
During this month, we rededicate ourselves to breaking the cycle of 
violence. By providing young people with education about healthy 
relationships, and by changing attitudes that support violence, we 
recognize that domestic violence can be prevented. We must build the 
capacity of our Nation's victim service providers to reach and serve 
those in need. We urge community leaders to raise awareness and bring 
attention to this quiet crisis. And across America, we encourage victims 
and their families to call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-
800-799-SAFE. Together, we must ensure that, in America, no victim of 
domestic violence ever struggles alone.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2009, as 
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I ask all Americans to do 
their part to end domestic violence in this country by supporting their 
communities' efforts to assist victims in finding the help and healing 
they need.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8429 of October 1, 2009

National Information Literacy Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, we are inundated with vast amounts of information. A 24-hour 
news cycle and thousands of global television and radio networks, 
coupled with an immense array of online resources, have challenged our 
long-held perceptions of information management. Rather than merely 
possessing data, we must also learn the skills necessary to acquire, 
collate, and evaluate information for any situation. This new type of 
literacy also requires competency with communication technologies, 
including computers and mobile devices that can help in our day-to-day 
decisionmaking. National Information Literacy Awareness Month highlights 
the need for all Americans to be adept in the skills necessary to 
effectively navigate the Information Age.
Though we may know how to find the information we need, we must also 
know how to evaluate it. Over the past decade, we have seen a crisis of 
authenticity emerge. We now live in a world where anyone can publish an 
opinion or perspective, whether true or not, and have that opinion 
amplified within the information marketplace. At the same time, 
Americans have unprecedented access to the diverse and independent 
sources of information, as well as institutions such as libraries and 
universities, that can help separate truth from fiction and signal from 
noise.
Our Nation's educators and institutions of learning must be aware of--
and adjust to--these new realities. In addition to the basic skills of 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, it is equally important that our 
students are given the tools required to take advantage of the 
information available to them. The ability to seek, find, and decipher 
information can be applied to countless life decisions, whether 
financial, medical, educational, or technical.
This month, we dedicate ourselves to increasing information literacy 
awareness so that all citizens understand its vital importance. An 
informed and educated citizenry is essential to the functioning of our 
modern democratic society, and I encourage educational and community 
institutions across the country to help Americans find and evaluate the 
information they seek, in all its forms.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2009 as 
National Information Literacy Awareness Month. I call upon the people of 
the United States to recognize the important role information plays in 
our daily lives, and appreciate the need for a greater understanding of 
its impact.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8430 of October 2, 2009

National Arts and Humanities Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our Nation's history, the power of the arts and humanities to 
move people has built bridges and enriched lives, bringing individuals 
and communities together through the resonance of creative expression. 
It is the painter, the author, the musician, and the historian whose 
work inspires us to action, drives us to contemplation, stirs joy in our 
hearts, and calls upon us to consider our world anew. The arts and 
humanities contribute to the vibrancy of our society and the strength of 
our democracy, and during National Arts and Humanities Month, we 
recommit ourselves to ensuring all Americans can access and enjoy them.
Our Nation's cultural assets tell the story of America's diversity and 
reveal our common humanity. Countless American artists develop unique 
styles by infusing their work with cultural elements from across the 
country and the world, and in turn, have an impact on the global arts 
community. Through history and philosophy, we learn the heritage of 
fellow Americans and appreciate the arc of their narrative as an 
integral part of our own. Cultural exchanges, collaborative projects, 
and continuing education programs help us to share and preserve a mosaic 
of rich traditions and provide future generations with opportunities for 
artistic expression.
The arts and humanities also bring our economy untold benefits. Millions 
of Americans take part in the non-profit and for-profit arts industries. 
Cultural and arts activities not only contribute tens of billions of 
dollars to our economy, but also inspire innovation. In neighborhoods 
and communities across the Nation, the arts and humanities lie at the 
center of revitalization, inspiring creativity, ideas, and new hope in 
areas that have gone too long without it.
Every American deserves an opportunity to study, understand, and 
contribute to the arts and humanities. This must begin in our schools, 
where children may have their first and most important exposure to these 
disciplines. Working on their own masterpieces and finding inspiration 
in the work of others, young people are opened to new means of 
expression that sharpen their creative faculties. An education in music, 
dance, drama, design, and fine art reinforces skills in fields like math 
and science, and it can help students reach their full potential. In an 
ever-changing world, we must prepare our students with the knowledge, 
creative skills, and an ability to innovate so they can compete and 
succeed on a global stage.
As a people, we have an unlimited capacity for self-expression and 
personal interpretation. While we may not always agree with what we see 
or hear, it is our open-mindedness that commends the artistic struggle 
behind the creation and our curiosity that pursues its vision. This 
month, we honor this artistic spirit that lives and breathes within 
every American. Creativity and a thirst for understanding are the fuel 
that has fed our Nation's success for centuries, and they will continue 
to be well into our future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2009 as 
National Arts and Humanities Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to join together in observing this month with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs to celebrate the arts and 
humanities in America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8431 of October 2, 2009

National Energy Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A more prosperous future for our Nation's economy means making 
investments in energy efficiency and clean energy today. Well-funded 
energy research and development will not only help protect our 
environment and support our communities, but it will also address 
concerns of global competitiveness and national security. Innovation in 
energy technology will decrease our oil use, strengthen our economy, and 
reduce the dangerous pollution that causes climate change.
As American scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs bring new and 
improved energy technologies to homes and businesses in this country and 
around the world, they will be showing American leadership and vision 
while also making clean energy the profitable kind of energy. During 
National Energy Awareness Month, we recognize the contributions of 
individuals, organizations, and companies that are committed to 
advancing energy innovation and efficiency, and we promote the 
importance of a clean energy economy to our Nation.
The Federal Government is the largest consumer of energy in the United 
States, and my Administration is committed to leading by example in the 
use of clean energy and increased energy efficiency. Not only will we 
lead through our performance, we will also leverage our ability to be 
the kind of customer that can help turn an idea into a great American 
enterprise. Through State and local grants, increased funding for 
weatherization programs, job training programs, and policies to support 
clean energy businesses, we are ushering in a new era of green energy 
that will benefit our economic recovery, our security, and our long-term 
prosperity.
We face a turning point in our Nation's energy policy. We can either 
remain the world's leading importer of oil, or we can become the world's 
leading exporter of clean energy technology. We can allow climate change 
to wreak unnatural havoc, or we can create jobs deploying low-carbon 
technologies to prevent its worst effects.
Throughout our history, Americans have successfully confronted 
challenges that have tested our determination and our capacity to 
change. If we are to advance energy and climate security, we must focus 
on energy efficiency, promote sustainable industries, accelerate job 
training and job creation in these areas, and set effective and 
achievable standards for the generation and use of clean energy. As a 
Nation, we will lead by innovating, adapting to the global marketplace, 
and investing in the kind of sustainable future we want for the 
generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2009 as 
National Energy Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to mark this month by making clean energy choices that can both 
rebuild our economy and make it more sustainable.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8432 of October 2, 2009

Fire Prevention Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As powerful as any force in the natural world, fire deserves our utmost 
attention. Unchecked, fire can destroy homes, devastate our environment, 
and, at its worst, injure or fatally harm individuals. Fire Prevention 
Week is a time to learn about important fire safety issues and empower 
our communities to stay ``Fire Smart.'' It is also a time to honor our 
Nation's brave firefighters and volunteers who risk their lives to 
protect their fellow Americans.
Every year, thousands of Americans experience fires in their homes and 
workplaces. We can greatly reduce these tragedies by taking a few, very 
simple steps. For example, if each of us strives to remain attentive 
while cooking, to properly dispose of all smoking materials, and to 
regularly check and replace smoke alarm batteries, we can help keep our 
families safe from harm and protect personal property. Additional 
precautionary measures should also include the formation of an emergency 
plan and the education of our children about the proper ways to handle 
potentially dangerous situations with fire.
This week's theme, ``Stay Fire Smart! Don't Get Burned,'' focuses on 
increasing burn awareness and prevention. We can each do more to avoid 
severe burns by testing water temperature, remaining aware of open 
flames, and ensuring that heating elements--such as those in electric 
stoves, toasters, hair appliances, and space heaters--are secure and 
operated properly. These easy, common sense practices can help Americans 
avoid suffering painful burns.
Fire can have a devastating impact on the life of an individual or 
family, and it can have far-reaching financial and human consequences. 
Wildfires can burn hundreds of acres and affect numerous communities, 
while household fires can spread to neighboring buildings. These and 
other emergency situations can endanger the lives of not only the 
public, but also our rescue workers and firefighters. During Fire 
Prevention Week, we are reminded of the dangers of fire, we honor the 
brave men and women who protect us from it, and we recommit ourselves to 
its responsible use.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 4 through 
October 10, 2009, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 4, 2009, 
in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will 
be flown at half staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the 
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans 
to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and 
activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their 
tragic consequences.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8433 of October 2, 2009

Child Health Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation has an obligation to provide access to affordable, high-
quality health care for all our children. No child should be forced to 
go without medical attention because the cost of a doctor visit is too 
high. Healthy children are better equipped to combat illness and to 
perform well in school, impacting their development well into adulthood. 
On Child Health Day, we recognize the fundamental importance of health 
care for our Nation's children, and dedicate our collective energies to 
support their needs and those of their families.
The responsibility for our children's health rests with every American. 
Parents and guardians should lead by example. We must teach our children 
the importance of healthy eating and a physically active lifestyle. We 
can support community programs across America that provide our young 
people with healthy choices, and ensure that families have the resources 
necessary to champion the health of their children. From outdoor 
activities to community athletic teams, we can seize opportunities to 
increase physical activity in the lives of our children, and promote 
healthy habits at an early age.
When our children make smart, healthy decisions, they are set on the 
path towards success. A balanced diet, coupled with proper exercise, has 
proven effective in combating childhood obesity and other chronic 
illnesses among our Nation's young people. More recently, the lure of 
indoor distractions has drawn our children away from the athletic fields 
and outdoor activities that can be part of a healthy lifestyle. We must 
engage our Nation's children in behaviors that support their physical 
fitness, ensure they have access to healthy, affordable food, and 
empower their families with the information essential for healthy 
living.
As a Nation, we cannot allow our children to fail in reaching their full 
potential because we fail to meet their basic needs. My Administration 
has made children's health a priority, and I was proud to sign the 
reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 
extending health care to millions of young Americans who were previously 
uninsured. Today, we celebrate the health of our children and rededicate 
ourselves to providing a bright, healthy future for our Nation's youth.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 5, 
2009, as Child Health Day.
I call upon families, child health professionals, faith-based and 
community organizations, and governments to help ensure that America's 
children stay safe and healthy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8434 of October 6, 2009

German-American Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Comprising the Nation's largest ancestry group, German Americans have 
contributed to our collective identity since the first settlements were 
founded in the 17th century. Essential to the growth of America, these 
farmers, soldiers, entrepreneurs, and patriots gave their strength, 
determination, and in some circumstances, their lives, so we all may 
experience a brighter tomorrow. It is in this spirit that German 
Americans continue to enrich our national character, sharing their proud 
heritage with new generations from every background. Today, we celebrate 
German Americans for their remarkable role in our Nation's development.
Our citizens of German descent excel in every discipline and open our 
minds to the expanses of human possibility. When we drive across a 
suspension bridge, listen to music played on a Steinway piano, or send a 
child to kindergarten, their unique traditions and customs surround us. 
German Americans have influenced our Nation in myriad ways with their 
industry, culture, and engagement in public life.
Germany and its people have also been active participants in our 
Nation's history. This year, we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the 
Federal Republic of Germany, and the 20th anniversary of the fall of the 
Berlin Wall. These milestones reinforce the German people's dedication 
to democratic ideals, and we honor the bonds that tie our two nations 
together.
America is a stronger Nation because of those families who have 
established longstanding roots in our country, as well as by those who 
have recently emigrated from abroad. German immigrants, inhabiting every 
major city, have given much of themselves throughout our history, 
selflessly expanding the reach of the American Dream. On this day, we 
celebrate and honor the past, present, and future contributions of 
German Americans to the rich and textured story of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2009, as 
German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the 
history of German Americans and to commemorate the many contributions 
they have made to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8435 of October 7, 2009

Leif Erikson Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On this day in 1825, the ship Restauration landed in New York City after 
sailing for 3 months from Stavanger, Norway. The 52 passengers aboard 
represented the first organized emigration of Norwegians to America. 
These brave individuals set to the seas, following in the grand 
footsteps of the famous Scandinavian explorer Leif Erikson. Over a 
millennium ago, Leif Erikson--son of Iceland and grandson of Norway--
arrived in North America and founded the settlement Vinland, located in 
modern-day Canada. Today, we celebrate his historic voyage and remember 
those who journeyed to America from far-away lands.
Our Nation's founding history is marked by millions of individuals who 
faced great hardship and difficulty as they pursued a brighter future 
abroad. As explorers, they did not know what they would find, but they 
were determined not to turn back, in order to learn what lay beyond the 
setting sun. This same spirit lived within Leif Erikson, and it has 
inspired countless others who venture from their homes in search of 
opportunity, uncertain of the possibilities and challenges that await 
them.
Today, our Nation continues to welcome those descendents of Leif Erikson 
to our shores. Nordic Americans have contributed immeasurably to the 
success of America. Their cultural accomplishments have enriched the 
diversity of our country. And their pioneering spirit continues to 
embody our Nation's unbounded enthusiasm for discovery and learning.
To honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the 
Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 
2, 1964, has authorized the President to proclaim October 9 of each year 
as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2009, as Leif Erikson Day, and I 
call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our country's rich Nordic-American 
heritage.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8436 of October 9, 2009

National School Lunch Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every young American deserves access to a wholesome, nutritious lunch. 
These meals prevent hunger and give our children the energy and 
nourishment they need to grow into healthy, productive adults. Since 
1946, the National School Lunch Program has helped to protect the health 
and well-being of our children by providing them with balanced, low-cost 
or free lunches throughout the school year. This week, we renew our 
commitment to serving healthy meals that will prepare our next 
generation of leaders to learn and thrive.
The National School Lunch Program serves more than 31 million students 
every school day at over 100,000 schools across our Nation. These meals 
can be an important source of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy 
products, containing essential nutrients to meet the demands of a 
growing child. For many schoolchildren, it will be their most nutritious 
meal--sometimes their only meal--of the day. This program can also teach 
children about the importance of good eating habits, which is vital to 
our Nation's fight against childhood obesity. In the coming months, my 
Administration will continue our partnership with Federal, State, and 
local leaders to strengthen the National School Lunch Program. We must 
work together to remove barriers that prevent some eligible children 
from receiving meals, and update nutrition standards to reflect the 
latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
Academic success requires hard work and concentration. Students 
distracted by hunger cannot match the focus of their peers. Poorly 
nourished students are also more likely to become ill, and miss class 
more frequently. During National School Lunch Week, we honor all those 
who make the National School Lunch Program possible, including 
government and school officials, food service professionals, farmers, 
and parents. By ensuring that every child, regardless of background or 
family income, is properly fed at school, we secure a brighter future 
for each of them and for America.
The Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-
780), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday 
in October each year as ``National School Lunch Week,'' and has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 11 through October 17, 
2009, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join 
the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch 
Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being 
of our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8437 of October 9, 2009

Columbus Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 500 years have passed since Christopher Columbus set sail 
across the Atlantic Ocean in a bold attempt to expand human 
understanding of the known world. His voyage radically altered the 
course of history and changed our world forever. Many generations later, 
that same spirit of exploration inspires Americans to pursue brave new 
frontiers in business, science, and technology. Today, we reflect on the 
transformation of North America from a land of boundless opportunity to 
the modern communities of the 21st century.
Born in Genoa, Italy, Christopher Columbus' journey aboard three Spanish 
ships revealed a new land for many European nations whose people would 
later flock to our shores in search of prosperity and freedom. These 
immigrants joined many thriving indigenous communities who suffered 
great hardships as a result of the changes to the land they inhabited. 
Although their competing ways of life were initially at odds, over time, 
the ``New World'' became a culturally and ethnically diverse place where 
we now enjoy the free exchange of ideas and democratic self-governance. 
Tribal communities continue to strengthen our Nation through their rich 
heritage and unique identity.
Columbus inspired generations of men and women to search out the 
farthest reaches of the world. From the coasts of Newfoundland to the 
Gulf of Mexico, explorers of Italian descent have directly influenced 
the growth of North America. Their dedication to our country has helped 
lay the foundation on which America was built. Today, Italian Americans 
continue to contribute immeasurably to the identity of our Nation, as 
role models, leaders, innovators, and committed public servants. From 
the boardroom to the classroom, they are prominent in every facet of 
American life.
In commemoration of Christopher Columbus' historic exploration 517 years 
ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), 
and an Act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250), has requested that the 
President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as 
``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 12, 2009, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon all the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8438 of October 9, 2009

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year on this day, Americans pause to remember a patriot and 
champion of liberty who fought valiantly for the freedom of our Nation. 
During our struggle for independence, General Casimir Pulaski displayed 
heroic leadership and ultimately sacrificed his life in service to our 
country. His commitment to liberty remains an inspiration to us today, 
230 years later, and it serves as a reflection of the many contributions 
Polish Americans have made to our national identity.
Born in Poland in 1745, Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski witnessed the 
occupation of Poland by foreign troops during his youth. He joined the 
struggle for Polish independence in 1768, fighting alongside his father 
with unwavering determination. Despite the tremendous courage of Pulaski 
and his compatriots, the foreign forces prevailed and Poland was divided 
among three of its neighbors. The young Casimir Pulaski was exiled, and, 
while in Paris, met America's envoy to France, Benjamin Franklin, and 
learned of our nascent quest for independence.
Arriving in America during the summer of 1777, General Pulaski quickly 
earned a commission and led his troops with admirable skill in a number 
of important campaigns. He would eventually become known as the ``Father 
of the American Cavalry.'' In 1779, Pulaski was mortally wounded during 
the siege of Savannah while trying to rally his troops under heavy enemy 
fire. Before laying down his life for the United States, this Polish and 
American hero had earned a reputation for his idealism and his 
courageous spirit.
Pulaski's ideals live on today in the many Polish-American communities 
across the country. These neighborhoods continue to celebrate Polish 
culture, while adding immeasurably to our national identity. Their 
contributions have expanded our collective knowledge, pushing the 
boundaries of science, business, and the arts. With each passing year, 
the cooperation between the United States and Poland grows, supported by 
the dedication and commitment of Polish Americans to our shared history. 
Today, as we remember General Pulaski, we celebrate our strong 
friendship with Poland, and honor those Americans of Polish heritage.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, October 11, 
2009, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to 
commemorate this occasion with appropriate programs and activities 
paying tribute to Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who defend the 
freedom of our great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8439 of October 15, 2009

White Cane Safety Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

All Americans deserve the freedom to participate in every aspect of our 
society and pursue their full measure of happiness. For blind Americans, 
the white cane is a potent symbol of that freedom--affording them 
greater independence and mobility. Today we renew our commitment to 
provide full inclusion and equal opportunities for those among us who 
are blind or have low vision. As Americans, we must nurture a society 
that values the unique abilities and individual contributions of all its 
people.
Individuals who are blind or have low vision are less constrained and 
better integrated in our country than ever before, but much work remains 
to ensure they have the opportunity to reach their full potential. My 
Administration is committed to securing full and equal access to 
education and employment for blind Americans and all those with 
disabilities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act substantially 
increased funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 
as well as vocational rehabilitation services, including job training, 
education, and placement.
For Americans who are blind or have low vision, a white cane is just one 
of a wide range of tools that sustain independence and productivity. In 
recent years, refreshable Braille displays and speech synthesis devices 
have given these individuals access to the Internet, unlocking a new 
frontier of limitless possibility. As we encourage the development of 
new assistive technologies, we must also improve access to existing 
tools. The Braille code has opened a doorway to literacy for countless 
individuals, but far too many blind children in our country are not 
learning to read it. By improving Braille literacy, we will secure a 
brighter future for these young Americans.
In the 45 years since White Cane Safety Day was first proclaimed by 
President Lyndon Johnson, Americans who are blind or have low vision 
have achieved substantial progress. As leaders in government and 
business, academics, and the arts, they have made remarkable 
contributions to our Nation, proving that sight is no requisite for 
success. We will continue to strive for a more just and equitable Nation 
that celebrates diversity in all its forms and promotes the full 
inclusion of all individuals in our communities.
By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628, as 
amended), the Congress designated October 15 of each year as White Cane 
Safety Day to recognize the contributions of Americans who are blind or 
have low vision.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2009, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8440 of October 19, 2009

National Character Counts Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In communities across America, people are working together to see our 
country through challenging times--educating our children, caring for 
the sick, and extending a hand to those in need. They remind us that the 
true character of our Nation is revealed by the good we do when the 
moment is challenging. During National Character Counts Week, we pay 
tribute to the men and women who are selflessly serving others, 
inspiring and encouraging younger generations to develop the compassion, 
dedication, and strength of character that is the mark of our great 
Nation.
Instilling sound character and a sense of responsibility in our children 
is critical to our country's future. When we teach young people about 
time-honored values like integrity and humility, we promote good 
citizenship and civic virtues that will guide them through life and 
sustain our democracy. Parents play an integral role in cultivating the 
character of their children, and they must help them understand the 
consequences of poor choices and the rewards of healthy, sound 
decisions. Teachers, clergy, local leaders, and countless other 
volunteers can also be role models and mentors for America's youth as 
they devote their time and energy to serving their communities. The 
brave members of our Armed Forces who sacrifice every day for our Nation 
are tremendous examples of strong character for us all to follow.
Throughout our history, the pursuit of our highest ideals--hard work, 
curiosity, tolerance, and patriotism--has been the quiet force behind 
our progress. As Americans, we must hold true to these fundamental 
values that have propelled us forward time and again to adapt and lead 
in an ever-changing world. National Character Counts week is an 
opportunity to recognize the depth of America's character and to honor 
those who pass on our values to future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 18 through 
October 24, 2009, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public 
officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8441 of October 19, 2009

United Nations Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United Nations was created 64 years ago by men and women from every 
corner of the world. These architects of international cooperation acted 
out of an idealism rooted in the hard-earned lessons of war. They had 
the wisdom to understand that nations could do far more to advance their 
interests by acting together than by letting themselves be split apart. 
The original 51 member nations were united around a commitment to peace, 
humanity, and justice.
Today, with 192 member states, the United Nations is the principle forum 
for all nations, large and small, to work in concert to meet the global 
challenges no nation can confront alone. The U.N. is vital to America's 
efforts to create a better, safer world. Through peacekeeping missions 
that have saved so many lives and averted so many wars; lifesaving 
humanitarian work; critical development activities; and its unique 
legitimacy, the U.N. can function as a forum that brings all nations 
together.
The U.N. sometimes struggles to live up to its founding ideals, as it 
can only be effective if its member states choose to meet their own 
responsibilities. At its best, this indispensible, if imperfect, 
institution helps to resolve conflicts and rebuild shattered societies; 
to lay the foundations of democracy, human rights, and development; and 
to establish conditions in which people can live in dignity and mutual 
respect. The member states of the U.N. have an obligation to demonstrate 
the will and leadership to match the aspirations of all. Now is the time 
for all of us to assume our share of responsibility to meet global 
challenges.
Committed in our resolve to create a world our people deserve, we look 
to the future with confidence. As expressed in the founding values of 
the United Nations, we share a common security and are unified by our 
common humanity. This truth calls us to work cooperatively with nations 
from around the globe in the pursuit of peace, economic prosperity, and 
human opportunity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2009, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, and the 
officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States to 
observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8442 of October 23, 2009

National Forest Products Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's forests have helped spur the growth and development that has 
been indispensable to our Nation's success. They have provided timber 
and water, as well as habitat for wildlife and opportunities for 
recreational activities. As a repository for renewable natural 
resources, forests have supplied the raw materials that have sustained 
us throughout our history. During National Forest Products Week, we 
recognize the value of our woodlands and commit ourselves to good 
stewardship and conservation practices that help us to responsibly 
manage our Nation's forests.
As a renewable and recyclable resource, wood is one of our Nation's most 
environmentally friendly building materials. Wood fiber is used 
throughout our daily lives, from the paper we write on to the offices 
where we work. We value the beauty of wood in our furniture, in our 
homes, and in artwork that surrounds us. Today, modern technology and 
stewardship practices by Federal, State, tribal, and private landowners 
have improved the way we manage our natural resources so that forests 
can meet the needs of current and future generations.
Forests are one of the foundations on which our Nation was formed; they 
are the backbone of our environment. This week, we recognize the value 
of forest products and the importance of their sustainable use to our 
lives.
To recognize the importance of products from our forests, the Congress, 
by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the 
week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as National 
Forest Products Week and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning on the third Sunday in 
October of each year as National Forest Products Week. I call on all 
Americans to celebrate the varied uses and products of our forested 
lands, as well as the people who carry on the tradition of careful 
stewardship of these precious natural resources for generations to come.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8443 of October 23, 2009

Declaration of a National Emergency With Respect to the 2009 H1N1 
Influenza Pandemic

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On April 26, 2009, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the 
``Secretary'') first declared a public health emergency under section 
319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d, in response to the 
2009 H1N1 influenza virus. The Secretary has renewed that declaration 
twice, on July 24, 2009, and October 1, 2009. In addition, by rapidly 
identifying the virus, implementing public health measures, providing 
guidance for health professionals and the general public, and developing 
an effective vaccine, we have taken proactive steps to reduce the impact 
of the pandemic and protect the health of our citizens. As a Nation, we 
have prepared at all levels of government, and as individuals and 
communities, taking unprecedented steps to counter the emerging 
pandemic. Nevertheless, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic continues to evolve. The 
rates of illness continue to rise rapidly within many communities across 
the Nation, and the potential exists for the pandemic to overburden 
health care resources in some localities. Thus, in recognition of the 
continuing progression of the pandemic, and in further preparation as a 
Nation, we are taking additional steps to facilitate our response.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including sections 201 and 301 of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and consistent with 
section 1135 of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 
1320b-5), do hereby find and proclaim that, given that the rapid 
increase in illness across the Nation may overburden health care 
resources and that the temporary waiver of certain standard Federal 
requirements may be warranted in order to enable U.S. health care 
facilities to implement emergency operations plans, the 2009 H1N1 
influenza pandemic in the United States constitutes a national 
emergency. Accordingly, I hereby declare that the Secretary may exercise 
the authority under section 1135 of the SSA to temporarily waive or 
modify certain requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State 
Children's Health Insurance programs and of the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule throughout the duration 
of the public health emergency declared in response to the 2009 H1N1 
influenza pandemic. In exercising this authority, the Secretary shall 
provide certification and advance written notice to the Congress as 
required by section 1135(d) of the SSA (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5(d)).
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8444 of October 30, 2009

Military Family Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

No one pays a higher price for our freedom than members of our Nation's 
military and their families. As sons and daughters, husbands and wives, 
and mothers and fathers are deployed, military families endure with 
exceptional resilience and courage. They provide our troops with 
invaluable encouragement and love, and serve our Nation in their own 
right. During Military Family Month, we honor the families of our Armed 
Forces and thank them for their dedication to our country.
Though only a small percentage of our Nation's population, our troops 
bear the great responsibility of protecting our people. They, along with 
their families, serve us every day with courage and dignity. Ensuring 
that military families receive the respect they deserve and the support 
they have earned is a top priority for my Administration.
The strength of our Nation is measured not just by our success on the 
battlefield, but also by our ability to support those families who have 
made so many sacrifices for us. Time and again, military families have 
shown their heart in the face of adversity. We have a solemn obligation 
to ensure that while our men and women in uniform discharge their 
duties, we do all we can to promote and preserve the well-being of their 
families. We must also support the families of our wounded warriors and 
our fallen heroes who have paid the ultimate price for the freedoms we 
enjoy.
This month, we celebrate the tremendous contributions of military 
families, convey to them our deepest respect and appreciation, and 
recommit ourselves to their support.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2009 as 
Military Family Month. I call on all Americans to honor military 
families through private actions and public service for the tremendous 
contributions they make in the support of our service members and our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8445 of October 30, 2009

National Adoption Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

All children deserve a safe, loving family to protect and care for them. 
In America, thousands of young people are waiting for that opportunity. 
During National Adoption Month, we honor those families that have 
strengthened America through adoption, and we recommit to reducing the 
number of children awaiting adoption into loving families.
America is a country rich in resources and filled with countless caring 
men and women who hope to adopt. These individuals come from all walks 
of life, united in their commitment to love a child who is in need of 
the protective arms of a parent. We must do more to ensure that adoption 
is a viable option for them. By continually opening up the doors to 
adoption, and supporting full equality in adoption laws for all American 
families, we allow more children to find the permanent homes they yearn 
for and deserve.
This month, we also focus on children in foster care. These children are 
not in the system by their own choosing, but are forced into it by 
unfortunate or tragic circumstances. These young people have specific 
needs and require unique support. Federal, State, and local governments, 
communities, and individuals all have a role to play in ensuring that 
foster children have the resources and encouragement they need to 
realize their hopes and dreams.
The course of our future will depend on what we do to help the next 
generation of Americans succeed. This month, we celebrate those families 
brought together by adoption and renew our commitments to children in 
the foster care system.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2009 as 
National Adoption Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by reaching out to support and honor adoptive families, as well as to 
participate actively in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting 
children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8446 of October 30, 2009

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, millions of American families experience the difficult 
reality of Alzheimer's disease. The physical and emotional demands of 
caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's can be overwhelming, but no one 
should face this disease alone. During National Alzheimer's Disease 
Awareness Month, we recognize all those living with Alzheimer's disease 
and honor the caregivers, including families and friends, who support 
them. We also renew our commitment to research that is improving 
treatments for this illness and may one day prevent it entirely.
Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible and progressive brain disorder 
that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills. Symptoms usually appear 
after age 60, but many scientists now believe damage to the brain may 
begin decades earlier. Research conducted and supported by the National 
Institutes of Health and the Veterans Health Administration has shed 
light on these early effects and identified genetic risk factors for 
Alzheimer's. Doctors are now able to start treatments earlier, slowing 
the loss of brain cells and the progression of debilitating physical and 
mental impairments.
As we seek hope for families struggling with Alzheimer's disease, we 
must leave no avenue unexplored. Embryonic stem cells may hold the key 
for us to better understand, and possibly cure, some of our most 
devastating diseases and conditions. That is why I signed an Executive 
Order lifting the ban on Federal funding for embryonic stem cell 
research, with proper guidelines and strict oversight to prohibit abuse.
We must continue the urgent work of giving substance to hope for all who 
dream of a day when words like ``terminal'' and ``incurable'' are 
finally retired from our vocabulary. Until then, we must strive to ease 
the burden of every individual struggling to recall a spouse's name; 
every parent unable to recognize a child's face; and every family member 
or friend who brings them comfort and care.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2009 as 
National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of 
the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8447 of October 30, 2009

National Diabetes Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Diabetes directly affects the lives of millions of Americans and their 
families. While no cure exists, medical advancements are continually 
producing new, more effective treatments to control the disease. 
Individuals who manage their diabetes properly can lower their risk of 
complications and live productive, normal lives. During National 
Diabetes Month, we recommit to educating Americans about the warning 
signs of diabetes, and help those with the condition to mitigate the 
effects of this devastating disease.
The two common forms of diabetes are known as type 1 and type 2. Type 1 
diabetes occurs when an individual's immune system destroys insulin-
producing cells. The outlook for those with type 1 diabetes has 
dramatically improved in the past few decades due to a host of 
innovations. Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form of diabetes, and 
usually affects individuals age 40 and older, and those who are 
overweight, inactive, or have a family history of the disease. Every 
day, 10 children in this country are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes--a 
staggering statistic that reflects the growing epidemic of obesity in 
our country.
Preventive care is the simplest way to avoid diabetes and its 
complications. A healthy diet, combined with daily exercise, has been 
shown to dramatically reduce incidence of this disease. African 
Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans, as well as the elderly, are at 
greater risk of developing diabetes over their lifetimes. As a Nation, 
we must ensure that all Americans know the warning signs of this 
disease, and if diagnosed, have access to affordable, quality medical 
care to help control it.
While diabetes is a complex and challenging disease, dedicated 
researchers continue to make important discoveries. This month, we honor 
those who have made these successes possible, support those who are 
battling diabetes, and rededicate ourselves to sustaining Federal 
investments in research and education programs that improve the 
prevention and treatment of this disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2009 as 
National Diabetes Month. I encourage citizens, medical institutions, 
Government and social service agencies, businesses, non-profit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
help prevent, treat, and manage diabetes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8448 of October 30, 2009

National Family Caregivers Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The true strength of the American family finds its roots in an 
unwavering commitment to care for one another. In difficult times, 
Americans come together to ensure our loved ones are comfortable and 
safe. Whether caring for a parent, relative, or child, our Nation's 
caregivers selflessly devote their time and energy to the well-being of 
those they look after. During National Family Caregivers Month, we honor 
the individuals providing essential services to family members who could 
not otherwise look after themselves.
Caregiver support is at the heart of my Administration's commitment to 
assisting our Nation's families. Currently, a variety of programs and 
services offer help and encouragement to family caregivers. The National 
Family Caregiver Support Program and the Lifespan Respite Care Act 
include important resources for caregivers of children and adults, with 
opportunities to receive much-needed assistance and take part in support 
programs with other families. These programs allow individuals to remain 
with their families for as long as possible while helping to ensure the 
wellness of participating care providers.
My Administration's dedication to caregivers is also embodied in our 
efforts to develop policies to support workers trying to manage their 
responsibilities on the job and at home. Families are best able to care 
for their loved ones when they can take time away from work without fear 
of losing their job or their income. We all have roles to play, 
including employers, by providing paid leave, flexible work 
arrangements, and other programs when feasible, to help ensure that 
caregivers are able to successfully meet their work and household 
responsibilities.
Every day, family caregivers assist loved ones with tasks ranging from 
personal care and homemaking, to transportation and financial 
assistance. As the foundation of America's long-term care system, these 
individuals give millions of Americans the peace of mind and security 
that only family can provide.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2009 as 
National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to pay 
tribute and support those who are caring for their family members, 
friends, and neighbors in need of assistance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8449 of October 30, 2009

National Native American Heritage Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The indigenous peoples of North America--the First Americans--have woven 
rich and diverse threads into the tapestry of our Nation's heritage. 
Throughout their long history on this great land, they have faced 
moments of profound triumph and tragedy alike. During National Native 
American Heritage Month, we recognize their many accomplishments, 
contributions, and sacrifices, and we pay tribute to their participation 
in all aspects of American society.
This month, we celebrate the ancestry and time-honored traditions of 
American Indians and Alaska Natives in North America. They have guided 
our land stewardship policies, added immeasurably to our cultural 
heritage, and demonstrated courage in the face of adversity. From the 
American Revolution to combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, they 
have fought valiantly in defense of our Nation as dedicated servicemen 
and women. Their native languages have also played a pivotal role on the 
battlefield. During World Wars I and II, Native American code talkers 
developed unbreakable codes to communicate military messages that saved 
countless lives. Native Americans have distinguished themselves as 
inventors, entrepreneurs, spiritual leaders, and scholars. Our debt to 
our First Americans is immense, as is our responsibility to ensure their 
fair, equal treatment and honor the commitments we made to their 
forebears.
The Native American community today faces huge challenges that have been 
ignored by our Government for too long. To help address this disparity, 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocates more than $3 
billion to help these communities deal with their most pressing needs. 
In the Fiscal Year 2010 budget, my Administration has proposed over $17 
billion for programs carried out by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian 
Health Service, and other Federal agencies that have a critical role to 
play in improving the lives of Native Americans. These programs will 
increase educational opportunities, address the scourge of alcohol abuse 
and domestic violence, promote economic development, and provide access 
to comprehensive, accessible, and affordable health care. While funding 
increases do not make up for past deficiencies, they do reflect our 
determination to honor tribal sovereignty and ensure continued progress 
on reservations across America.
As we seek to build on and strengthen our nation-to-nation relationship, 
my Administration is committed to ensuring tribal communities have a 
meaningful voice in our national policy debates as we confront the 
challenges facing all Americans. We will continue this constructive 
dialogue at the White House Tribal Nations Conference held in 
Washington, D.C., this month. Native American voices have echoed through 
the mountains, valleys, and plains of our country for thousands of 
years, and it is now our time to listen.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2009 as 
National Native American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to 
commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities, and to 
celebrate November 27, 2009, as Native American Heritage Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8450 of October 30, 2009

Veterans Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We have a sacred trust with those who wear the uniform of the United 
States of America. From the Minutemen who stood watch over Lexington and 
Concord to the service members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
American veterans deserve our deepest appreciation and respect. Our 
Nation's servicemen and women are our best and brightest, enlisting in 
times of peace and war, serving with honor under the most difficult 
circumstances, and making sacrifices that many of us cannot begin to 
imagine. Today, we reflect upon the invaluable contributions of our 
country's veterans and reaffirm our commitment to provide them and their 
families with the essential support they were promised and have earned.
Caring for our veterans is more than a way of thanking them for their 
service. It is an obligation to our fellow citizens who have risked 
their lives to defend our freedom.
This selflessness binds our fates with theirs, and recognizing those who 
were willing to give their last full measure of devotion for us is a 
debt of honor for every American.
We also pay tribute to all who have worn the uniform and continue to 
serve their country as civilians. Many veterans act as coaches, 
teachers, and mentors in their communities, selflessly volunteering 
their time and expertise. They visit schools to tell our Nation's 
students of their experiences and help counsel our troops returning from 
the theater of war. These men and women possess an unwavering belief in 
the idea of America: no matter where you come from, what you look like, 
or who your parents are, this is a place where anything is possible. Our 
veterans continue to stand up for those timeless American ideals of 
liberty, self-determination, and equal opportunity.
On Veterans Day, we honor the heroes we have lost, and we rededicate 
ourselves to the next generation of veterans by supporting our Soldiers, 
Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen as they return home from 
duty. Our grateful Nation must keep our solemn promises to these brave 
men and women and their families. They have given their unwavering 
devotion to the American people, and we must keep our covenant with 
them.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our servicemen 
and women have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's 
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2009, as Veterans Day. I 
encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our 
veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers. I 
call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the 
United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their 
communities. I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal 
organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities to support 
this day with commemorative expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8451 of November 6, 2009

Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy at Fort Hood, Texas

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's thoughts and prayers are with the service members, 
civilians, and families affected by the tragic events at Fort Hood, 
Texas. The brave victims, who risked their lives to protect their fellow 
countrymen, serve as a constant source of strength and inspiration to 
all Americans. We ask God to watch over the fallen, the wounded, and all 
those who are suffering at this difficult hour.
As a mark of respect honoring the victims of the tragedy at Fort Hood, 
Texas, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution 
and the laws of the United States of America, that the flag of the 
United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon 
all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval 
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the 
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its 
Territories and possessions until sunset, Tuesday, November 10, 2009. I 
also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same 
length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular 
offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities 
and naval vessels and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8452 of November 9, 2009

World Freedom Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Twenty years ago today, the Wall came down in Berlin and both a country 
and a continent came together. After thousands of East Berliners flooded 
through checkpoints into West Berlin, border restrictions dissolved 
across Eastern Bloc countries. The Iron Curtain that divided Europe for 
decades finally fell, ushering in a new era of freedom and cooperation. 
On this anniversary, we are reminded that no challenge is too great for 
a world united in common purpose.
After the Berlin Wall fell, oppressive regimes across the globe gave 
way. From Kiev to Cape Town, prison camps closed and democracy's doors 
were unlocked for millions who had known only tyranny. Markets opened 
too, spreading information and technology that empowered once-insolvent 
nations to achieve prosperity. Twenty years later, our world is more 
interconnected than at any time in human history, giving rise to new 
opportunities for shared progress.
Today, the barriers that challenge our world are not walls of cement and 
iron, but ones of fear, irresponsibility, and indifference. History 
reminds us that such walls can be torn down, but where they still exist 
we must work with all nations to strengthen civil societies, support 
democratic institutions and the rule of law, and promote free and fair 
electoral processes. Upholding these principles into the 21st century 
will require America's enduring commitment and steady leadership.
From our first days as a Nation, Americans have felt a sense of urgency 
and determination to promote liberty and release the potential within 
each individual to contribute to the common good. On World Freedom Day, 
we celebrate the thriving democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, and 
we honor their citizens' right to choose their own destinies and 
contribute to their nations' future success.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2009, as 
World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day in fellowship with other nations and people of the 
world with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our 
dedication to freedom and democracy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8453 of November 13, 2009

America Recycles Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, Americans who recycle conserve valuable resources while 
reducing our Nation's carbon footprint. The reprocessing of materials is 
fundamental to our future prosperity, as recycling helps preserve our 
natural environment and sustain our economy. Recycling in the United 
States is a $236 billion industry, employing 1.1 million workers 
nationwide in 56,000 businesses. On America Recycles Day, we celebrate 
the individuals, communities, local governments, and businesses that 
recycle their waste and continually think of innovative ways to use 
materials that might otherwise be discarded.
Recycling improves our daily lives and helps to protect our planet for 
the future. Through recycling, we conserve energy, consume less of our 
precious natural resources, decrease the amount of waste deposited in 
landfills, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Communities across 
America also benefit by avoiding the pollution associated with the 
extraction of raw materials and their processing into finished products.
If we are to manage materials and products on a life-cycle basis, we 
must responsibly use and reuse our resources. Curbside recycling, 
electronics collection drives, community composting programs, and other 
similar methods contribute to the success of our efforts. Our Nation's 
health and prosperity depends on the productive and sustainable use of 
our environment. By recommitting ourselves to recycling, we have the 
opportunity to secure our long-term success and ensure a bright future 
for the next generation of Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2009, as 
America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I 
encourage all Americans to continue their recycling efforts throughout 
the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8454 of November 19, 2009

National Entrepreneurship Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, American entrepreneurs have been an effective 
force for innovation at home and around the world. From the airplane to 
the Internet search engine to new tractors, they have pioneered 
technologies, products, and processes that have improved lives and 
shaped the course of our future. Today, they are fueling our economy 
with their creativity, tireless work ethic, and risk-taking spirit. 
During National Entrepreneurship Week, we renew our commitment to 
supporting American entrepreneurs, including social entrepreneurs, who 
are spreading opportunity and prosperity across our Nation.
Entrepreneurs are the engine of job creation in America, generating 
millions of good jobs. Many begin with nothing more than a good idea, 
and translate new products and services into vibrant businesses. To 
secure our Nation's future prosperity, we must ensure that our 
entrepreneurs have the tools they need to survive and thrive.
My Administration is working to provide opportunities and conditions for 
entrepreneurs to succeed. We are supporting the flow of credit by 
increasing loan guarantees and reducing borrowing fees to help more 
Americans start businesses. We also made the Research and 
Experimentation Tax Credit permanent to help burgeoning companies afford 
the high costs of developing new products and technologies. The recently 
formed Office of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the Department of 
Commerce is building on these efforts with new policies and initiatives 
to unleash creativity and innovation, as well as turn inspired ideas 
into new employment-generating businesses.
Our Nation led the world's economies in the 20th century because we led 
the world in innovation. To strengthen our position in the 21st century, 
we must rededicate ourselves to harnessing the creative spirit that has 
made America great.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 16 through 
November 22, 2009, as National Entrepreneurship Week. I call upon all 
Americans to recognize the important contributions of entrepreneurs to 
our economy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8455 of November 20, 2009

National Farm-City Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's farm and ranch families supply many of the basic 
necessities of our daily life. They manage a large portion of our 
country's fertile land base, and they are caretakers of our valuable 
natural resources and diverse ecosystems. Their connections with urban 
and suburban communities are critical to our economy and to the 
nourishment of our people. During National Farm-City Week, we express 
gratitude for the contributions of our Nation's farmers and ranchers, 
and we rededicate ourselves to providing all Americans with access to 
healthy food, and thus, a healthy future.
Pioneered by Native Americans, agriculture was our Nation's first 
industry. For agriculture to thrive in the 21st century, we must 
continue to cultivate the relationships between farmers and rural 
businesses and their partners and customers in cities and towns. 
American farmers and ranchers are proud to grow the food, feed, fuel, 
and fiber that enhance our national security and prosperity, and remain 
steadfast stewards of the land they love. We must ensure that farming is 
maintained as an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable 
way of life for future generations.
This Thanksgiving season, we celebrate farms of every size that produce 
fruits, vegetables, dairy, and livestock indispensable to the health of 
our families. We also recognize the vital ties between our urban and 
suburban communities and their local farmers through regional food 
systems, farmers markets, and community gardens. During National Farm-
City Week, we celebrate the bounty of America, and we honor the 
commitment of those who grow, harvest, and deliver agricultural goods to 
feed our country and grow our economy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week ending on 
Thanksgiving Day of each year as National Farm-City Week. I call on 
Americans as they gather with their families and friends to reflect on 
the accomplishments of all who dedicate their lives to promoting our 
Nation's agricultural abundance and environmental stewardship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the

Proclamation 8456 of November 20, 2009

National Family Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

American families are the foundation on which our Nation is built. Their 
expressions of unconditional love and dedication sustain family members 
and support our Nation's communities. During National Family Week, we 
celebrate the inclusive spirit of American families and applaud the 
commitment of those family members who encourage us to reach new 
heights.
My Administration is committed to helping American families meet the 
demands of modern life, increase their self-sufficiency, and achieve 
their full potential. Ten days after taking office, I established the 
White House Task Force on Middle Class Working Families, led by Vice 
President Biden. This Task Force is focused on raising the living 
standards of working families across the country. In addition, the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provides a broad spectrum of 
support to families experiencing difficult times. It boosts child care 
and Head Start programs, essential not only to a child's future but also 
a parent's peace of mind in the workplace. Health care reform will 
provide security and stability for American families with insurance and 
affordable options for uninsured Americans.
As we continue to grow as a Nation, we must also be engaged members of 
our larger family, composed of our neighbors, our colleagues, and the 
community where we live. We must appreciate the diversity of other 
families' traditions; we must reach out to help families in need; and we 
must take more responsibility for the care and development of all 
children, not just our own.
In this season of Thanksgiving, we are grateful that, at our best, 
America is a collection of strong families, standing united to make our 
Nation a place of hope and opportunity for future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 22 through 
November 28, 2009, as National Family Week. I invite States, local 
communities, and individuals to join together in observing this week 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's 
families.

Proclamation 8457 of November 20, 2009

National Child's Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's children deserve every opportunity to reach their fullest 
potential, and it is our responsibility to ensure they have the tools 
required to grow and flourish. This includes providing our young people 
with access to affordable, high-quality health care and an education 
that both informs and inspires. On National Child's Day, we celebrate 
the promise living within every child.
Ensuring the health and well-being of our Nation's children is one of 
our highest responsibilities. I was proud to sign the reauthorization of 
the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), extending health care to 
millions of young Americans who were previously uninsured. When given 
proper nutrition and medical care, healthy children can become 
productive, healthy adults.
My Administration is also committed to giving our children the 
educational support necessary for their development and future success. 
That is why we announced our Race to the Top award program, which 
challenges States to compete for over $4 billion in grants designed to 
spur systemic reform and embrace innovative approaches to teaching and 
learning in America's schools. If we are willing to come together and 
embrace a spirit of common purpose, our schools will perform better and 
our students will reach farther.
Across America, countless individuals selflessly provide their time and 
energy in our homes, schools, and community organizations to ensure our 
sons and daughters may one day realize their dreams. Today, we recommit 
ourselves to the vision of our founders to give all our children a fair 
chance and an equal start in life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 22, 2009, as 
National Child's Day. I call upon all citizens to observe this day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Proclamation 8458 of November 20, 2009

Thanksgiving Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

What began as a harvest celebration between European settlers and 
indigenous communities nearly four centuries ago has become our 
cherished tradition of Thanksgiving. This day's roots are intertwined 
with those of our Nation, and its history traces the American narrative.
Today, we recall President George Washington, who proclaimed our first 
national day of public thanksgiving to be observed ``by acknowledging 
with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God,'' and 
President Abraham Lincoln, who established our annual Thanksgiving Day 
to help mend a fractured Nation in the midst of civil war. We also 
recognize the contributions of Native Americans, who helped the early 
colonists survive their first harsh winter and continue to strengthen 
our Nation. From our earliest days of independence, and in times of 
tragedy and triumph, Americans have come together to celebrate 
Thanksgiving.
As Americans, we hail from every part of the world. While we observe 
traditions from every culture, Thanksgiving Day is a unique national 
tradition we all share. Its spirit binds us together as one people, each 
of us thankful for our common blessings.
As we gather once again among loved ones, let us also reach out to our 
neighbors and fellow citizens in need of a helping hand. This is a time 
for us to renew our bonds with one another, and we can fulfill that 
commitment by serving our communities and our Nation throughout the 
year. In doing so, we pay tribute to our country's men and women in 
uniform who set an example of service that inspires us all. Let us be 
guided by the legacy of those who have fought for the freedoms for which 
we give thanks, and be worthy heirs to the noble tradition of goodwill 
shown on this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 26, 
2009, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all the people of 
the United States to come together, whether in our homes, places of 
worship, community centers, or any place where family, friends and 
neighbors may gather, with gratitude for all we have received in the 
past year; to express appreciation to those whose lives enrich our own; 
and to share our bounty with others.

Proclamation 8459 of November 25, 2009

World AIDS Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation joins the world in celebrating the extraordinary advancements 
we have made in the battle against HIV and AIDS, and remembering those 
we have lost. Over the past three decades, brave men and women have 
fought devastating discrimination, stigma, doubt, and violence as they 
stood in the face of this deadly disease. Many of them would not be here 
today, but for the dedication of other persons living with HIV, their 
loved ones and families, community advocates, and members of the medical 
profession. On World AIDS Day, we rededicate ourselves to developing a 
national AIDS strategy that will establish the priorities necessary to 
combat this devastating epidemic at home, and to renewing our leadership 
role and commitments abroad.
Though we have been witness to incredible progress, our struggle against 
HIV/AIDS is far from over. With an infection occurring every nine-and-a-
half minutes in America, there are more than one million individuals 
estimated to be living with the disease in our country. Of those 
currently infected, one in five does not know they have the condition, 
and the majority of new infections are spread by people who are unaware 
of their own status. HIV/AIDS does not discriminate as it infiltrates 
neighborhoods and communities. Americans of any gender, age, ethnicity, 
income, or sexual orientation can and are contracting the disease.
Globally, there are over 33 million people living with HIV. While 
millions have died from this disease, the death rate is slowly declining 
due, in part, to our Nation's global effort through the President's 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program. However, HIV remains a 
leading cause of death worldwide. Women and children around the world 
are particularly vulnerable due to gender inequalities, gaps in access 
to services, and increases in sexual violence. While the statistics are 
distressing, new medications and scientific advancements give us reason 
for hope.
Tackling this disease will take an aggressive, steadfast approach. My 
Administration is developing a national HIV/AIDS strategy to bolster our 
response to the domestic epidemic, and a global health initiative that 
will build on PEPFAR's success. We will develop a strategy to reduce HIV 
incidence, improve access to care, and help eliminate HIV-related health 
disparities. We have already ensured that visitors to our shores living 
with HIV are not marginalized and discriminated against because of their 
HIV status. We have also secured the continuation of critical HIV/AIDS 
care and treatment services. Today, we recommit ourselves to building on 
the accomplishments of the past decades that have dramatically changed 
the domestic and global HIV/AIDS landscape.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2009, as 
World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the territories 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American 
people to join in appropriate activities to remember those who have lost 
their lives to AIDS, and to provide support and comfort to those living 
with this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8460 of December 2, 2009

Critical Infrastructure Protection Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Critical infrastructure protection is an essential element of a 
resilient and secure nation. Critical infrastructure are the assets, 
systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the 
United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a 
debilitating effect on security, national economic security, public 
health or safety. From water systems to computer networks, power grids 
to cellular phone towers, risks to critical infrastructure can result 
from a complex combination of threats and hazards, including terrorist 
attacks, accidents, and natural disasters. During Critical 
Infrastructure Protection Month, we pledge to work together to shelter 
our communities from the harm of uncertain threats.
My Administration is committed to ensuring our country's essential 
resources are safe and capable of recovering from disruptive incidents. 
The Department of Homeland Security is leading a coordinated national 
program to reduce risks and improve our national preparedness, timely 
response, and rapid recovery in the event of an attack, natural 
disaster, or other emergency. The Department, in collaboration with 
other Federal stakeholders, State, local, and tribal governments, and 
private sector partners, has developed the National Infrastructure 
Protection Plan (NIPP) to establish a framework for securing our 
resources and maintaining their resilience from all hazards during an 
event or emergency.
During Critical Infrastructure Protection Month, we rededicate ourselves 
to safeguarding and strengthening our Nation's infrastructure. 
Additionally, members of the public and private sectors should work with 
their appropriate State, regional, and local authorities to engage in 
critical infrastructure protection activities being coordinated across 
the country. Americans can learn more about the NIPP and its partnership 
framework by visiting: www.dhs.gov/criticalinfrastructure.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2009 as 
Critical Infrastructure Protection Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to recognize the importance of partnering to protect our 
Nation's resources and to observe this month with appropriate events and 
training to enhance our national security and resilience.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8461 of December 2, 2009

National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, people put themselves and their fellow Americans in danger on 
our Nation's roadways when they drive after consuming alcohol or after 
using legal and illegal drugs. During this holiday season, we must all 
be especially vigilant in protecting our families, friends, and 
neighbors from drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Although we have succeeded in decreasing the number of drunk drivers in 
recent years, we have seen a disturbing increase in Americans driving 
under the influence of drugs.
Operating a vehicle under the influence of drugs poses the same risks as 
drunk driving, and we must do more to stop this growing epidemic. 
Families, businesses, community organizations, and faith-based groups 
can promote substance abuse prevention as well as alternative sources of 
transportation for those under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Each 
of us can save lives in our own communities by encouraging our fellow 
citizens to drive responsibly.
My Administration is working hard to prevent impaired driving. The 
Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration is again sponsoring the campaign known as ``Drunk 
Driving. Over the Limit. Under Arrest.'' This effort involves thousands 
of law enforcement agencies across America. Police will expand their 
efforts during the high-risk travel period between December 16, 2009, 
and January 3, 2010 to ensure that impaired drivers are stopped and 
arrested.
During National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, we are reminded of 
the importance of driving free from the influence of alcohol and drugs, 
and we renew our commitment to preventing the senseless loss of life 
that too often results from this irresponsible behavior. By working 
together, we can make our Nation's roadways safer for all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2009 as 
National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make 
responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired 
driving.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8462 of December 2, 2009

International Day of Persons With Disabilities, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year, in an effort to renew our global commitment to human rights 
and fundamental freedoms for persons with disabilities, the United 
States became a proud signatory of the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This treaty represents a paradigm 
shift, urging equal protection and benefits for all citizens, and 
reaffirming the inherent dignity and independence of the 650 million 
people living with disabilities worldwide. Today, as we commemorate the 
International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we celebrate the skills, 
achievements, and contributions of persons with disabilities in America 
and around the world. We recognize the progress we have made toward 
equality for all, and we rededicate ourselves to ensuring individuals 
with disabilities can reach their greatest potential.
Despite our increased efforts, persons with disabilities continue to 
face barriers to their full participation in society. In the United 
States, Americans with disabilities still experience discrimination in 
the workplace and in their communities. In developing nations, 90 
percent of children with disabilities do not attend school, and women 
and girls with disabilities are all too often subjected to deep 
discrimination. If we are to move forward as a people, both at home and 
abroad, all individuals must be fully integrated into our human family.
The International Day of Persons with Disabilities is a time to renew 
our commitment to the principles of empowerment, dignity, and equality. 
The United States has co-sponsored and joined consensus on the United 
Nations General Assembly Third Committee's resolution titled, 
``Realizing the Millennium Development Goals for Persons with 
Disabilities.'' We must continue to embrace diversity and reject 
discrimination in all its forms, and insist on equality of opportunity 
and accessibility for all. Let our efforts remind us that when we work 
together, we can build a world free of unnecessary barriers and include 
every member of our international community.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2009, as 
International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I call on all Americans 
to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8463 of December 4, 2009

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared December 7, 1941, a ``date 
which will live in infamy.'' With over 3,500 Americans killed or 
wounded, the surprise attack by the Imperial Japanese on Pearl Harbor 
was an attempt to break the American will and destroy our Pacific Fleet. 
They succeeded in doing neither. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance 
Day, we pay tribute to the brave men and women who made the ultimate 
sacrifice for our country, and we honor all those who selflessly served 
our Nation at home and abroad during World War II.
On a tranquil Sunday morning, as war raged around the globe, the attack 
on Pearl Harbor effectively ended American isolation--thrusting our 
Nation into action. Japanese airplanes had launched an unprovoked 
assault on our military with immense firepower, and our service members 
valiantly answered the call. They defended their positions, fought back 
against the attackers, and cared for the wounded. In that darkest hour, 
men and women who had considered themselves ordinary found within 
themselves the ability to do something extraordinary. And in the months 
and years that followed, Americans all across the country would respond 
to Pearl Harbor with firm resolve, many joining our Armed Forces to 
defend our shores and our freedom.
This courage is not uncommon in the story of America--a story of heroes 
whose sacrifice and valor speak to their love of comrades and country; 
and whose goodness guides our quest for lasting peace. Today, and every 
day, we draw strength from the moment when the best among us defended an 
island and a Nation from the onslaught of tyranny, and forever altered 
the course of our history.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, December 7, 2009, as National Pearl 
Harbor Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn 
day of remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge 
all Federal agencies and interested organizations, groups, and 
individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff this 
December 7 in honor of those American patriots who died as a result of 
their service at Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8464 of December 9, 2009

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, And Human Rights Week, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 60 years ago, the United Nations General Assembly approved the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, declaring the ``inherent 
dignity'' and ``equal and inalienable rights'' of all human beings as 
the ``foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.'' This 
self-evident truth guides us today. Although every country and culture 
is unique, certain rights are universal: the freedom of people--
including women and ethnic and religious minorities--to live as they 
choose, speak their minds, organize peacefully and have a say in how 
they are governed, with confidence in the rule of law. History shows 
that countries that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, 
secure, and successful.
In the United States, these fundamental rights are the core of our 
Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, and our Bill of Rights. 
They are the values that define us as a people, the ideals that 
challenge us to perfect our union, and the liberties that generations of 
Americans have fought to preserve at home and abroad. Indeed, fidelity 
to our fundamental values is one of America's greatest strengths and the 
reason we stand in solidarity with those who seek these rights, wherever 
they live.
Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week must be our 
call to action. As Americans, we must keep striving to live up to our 
founding ideals. As a Nation, the United States will always side with 
the innocent whose rights are denied, the oppressed who yearn for 
equality, and all those around the world who strive for freedom. As 
members of what President Franklin Roosevelt called ``the human 
community,'' we will never waver in our pursuit of the rights, dignity, 
and security of every human being.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2009, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 2009, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 2009, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to mark these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8465 of December 15, 2009

65th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In December 1944, a brave band of American soldiers, stationed in the 
Ardennes Forest region on the Western Front of Europe, who were 
surrounded, poorly supplied and surviving in brutally cold conditions, 
took the brunt of a furious German assault. Their valor defined not just 
the beginning of the end of a World War, but also one of the greatest 
generations of Americans. Like patriots before them, they stood 
resolute, confident in their training, and determined to preserve those 
enduring American ideals of freedom and justice. On the 65th Anniversary 
of the Battle of the Bulge, a grateful Nation remembers the fallen who 
gave their lives in that critical battle, and we pay tribute to the 
heroes whose indomitable strength led to victory in World War II.
When asked about the Battle of the Bulge, British Prime Minister Sir 
Winston Churchill remarked, ``This is undoubtedly the greatest American 
battle of the war and will, I believe, be regarded as an ever-famous 
American victory.'' Confronting not just the advancing German Army, but 
the elements, American service members withstood the assault and 
eventually repelled the Nazi forces, but at tremendous cost in lives and 
wounded soldiers.
On this anniversary, we reflect on the enduring commitment of our Armed 
Forces in defending our liberty, as inspiring today as it was in 1944. 
The discipline and courage displayed in the Battle of the Bulge 
continues in Iraq, Afghanistan, and wherever our men and women in 
uniform are serving. They represent the best of our Nation and we are 
eternally grateful for their service and sacrifice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, December 
16, 2009, as the 65th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. I 
encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of remembrance with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8466 of December 16, 2009

Wright Brothers Day, 2009

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For 12 seconds on December 17, 1903, a wooden aircraft took to the skies 
above Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, lifting two brothers from Dayton, 
Ohio, to their place in history. Their singular triumph triggered a 
revolution in transportation that would bridge the vast distances 
between continents and forever alter our world. Today, we honor the 
enduring American spirit of creativity and innovation that made the 
Wright Brothers' maiden flight possible.
Self-taught and financed by the proceeds of their bicycle shop, the 
Wright Brothers' success embodies our Nation's proud tradition of 
entrepreneurship. In pursuit of the ageless dream of controlled flight, 
they persevered through great challenges. Early design failures, a 
skeptical public, and the sheer danger of their endeavors often tempted 
the brothers to quit, but they forged ahead with firm resolve and bold 
experimentation to complete their ascent to greatness.
In these challenging times, the story of Orville and Wilbur Wright 
reminds us of what can be accomplished when imagination is joined with 
tenacity. Their spirit lives on in every garage and basement workshop 
where American innovators still tinker, invent, and discover. The next 
Wright Brothers are among us today, working tirelessly toward a 
breakthrough that will spark a new industry and improve countless lives.
We must do all we can to support our Nation's entrepreneurs. As we work 
toward a bright future powered by cutting-edge ideas and new 
technologies, we celebrate this day by looking back to the Wright 
Brothers, whose achievements affirm the limitless potential of American 
ingenuity.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as 
amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of 
each year as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested 
the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of 
the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2009, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.

Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Sections 501(1) and (4) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2461(1) and (4)), provide that, in affording 
duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), 
the President shall have due regard for, among other factors, the effect 
such action will have on furthering the economic development of a 
beneficiary developing country and the extent of the beneficiary 
developing country's competitiveness with respect to eligible articles. 
Section 502(c)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(2)) provides that, 
in determining whether to designate any country as a beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP, the President shall take 
into account various factors, including the country's level of economic 
development, the country's per capita gross national product, the living 
standards of its inhabitants, and any other economic factors he deems 
appropriate. Section 502(d) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)) 
authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application 
of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any country after 
considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 
Act. Section 502(f)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)) requires 
the President to notify the Congress and the affected country, at least 
60 days before termination, of the President's intention to terminate 
the affected country's designation as a beneficiary developing country 
for purposes of the GSP.
2. Section 502(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(e)) provides that the 
President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
developing country if the President determines that such country has 
become a ``high income'' country as defined by the official statistics 
of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
Termination is effective on January 1 of the second year following the 
year in which such determination is made.
3. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that 
Croatia has become a ``high income'' country, and I am terminating the 
designation of that country as a beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2011.
4. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that 
Equatorial Guinea has become a ``high income'' country, and I am 
terminating the designation of that country as a beneficiary developing 
country for purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2011.
5. Section 502(a)(2) (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(2)) of the 1974 Act provides 
that the President may designate any beneficiary developing country as a 
least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, 
based on the considerations in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act 
(19 U.S.C. 2461 and 19 U.S.C. 2462(c)).
6. Pursuant to section 502(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered 
the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined that Cape Verde should be removed from the list of least-
developed beneficiary countries.
7. In Proclamation 8272 of June 30, 2008, the President determined that 
Trinidad and Tobago had become a ``high income'' country, and the 
designation of Trinidad and Tobago as a beneficiary developing country 
for purposes of the GSP shall be terminated, effective January 1, 2010. 
I have determined that technical rectifications should be made to the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect that 
determination.
8. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, the President 
is authorized to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries 
for purposes of the GSP and to provide duty-free treatment for eligible 
articles from beneficiary developing counties.
9. In Proclamation 6813 of July 28, 1995, the President suspended the 
designation of the Republic of Maldives (Maldives) as a beneficiary 
developing country under the GSP.
10. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a) of the 1974 Act, and taking into 
account the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I have 
determined that it is appropriate to terminate the suspension of 
preferential treatment under the GSP for articles that are currently 
eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Maldives and to 
redesignate Maldives as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of 
the GSP.
11. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the 
Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel 
(the ``USIFTA''), which the Congress approved in the United States-
Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``USIFTA Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2112 note).
12. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President 
determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of 
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel 
provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, 
suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such 
continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such 
additional duties as the President determines to be required or 
appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.
13. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, 
on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with 
Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products 
during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the ``2004 
Agreement'').
14. In Presidential Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent 
with the 2004 Agreement, the President determined, pursuant to section 
4(b) of the USIFTA Act, that it was necessary in order to maintain the 
general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with 
respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free 
access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified 
quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.
15. On December 10, 2008, the United States entered into an agreement 
with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force 
through December 31, 2009, to allow additional time for the two 
governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.
16. In Presidential Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008, the 
President determined that it was necessary in order to maintain the 
general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with 
respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA to extend such duty-free 
treatment through December 31, 2009. In Proclamation 8334, the President 
modified the HTS to provide duty-free access into the United States 
through December 31, 2009, for specified quantities of certain 
agricultural products of Israel. In Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 
2009, I further modified the HTS to provide the intended tariff 
treatment.
17. On December 6, 2009, the United States entered into a further 
agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in 
force through December 31, 2010, to allow for further negotiations on an 
agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.
18. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that 
it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal 
and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided 
for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States 
through the close of December 31, 2010, for specified quantities of 
certain agricultural products of Israel.
19. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the United 
States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``NAFTA Implementation Act'') (Public Law 103-
182), incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and rules 
of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
20. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) 
provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United 
States originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible 
for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA.
21. Presidential Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, modified the HTS 
to provide for modifications to the rules of origin under the NAFTA. I 
have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to 
provide for the intended rules of origin.
22. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to 
the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a 
good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff 
treatment under the USSFTA. I have determined that certain rules of 
origin under the USSFTA were inadvertently deleted in the HTS and that 
technical rectifications to the HTS are necessary to restore the 
intended rules of origin.
23. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA) with respect to the 
United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is 
an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment 
under the USCFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the 
HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin.
24. Presidential Proclamations 7987 of February 28, 2006; 7991 of March 
24, 2006; 7996 of March 31, 2006; 8034 of June 30, 2006; 8111 of 
February 28, 2007; and 8331 of December 23, 2008, implemented the 
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
(CAFTA-DR) with respect to the United States, including certain rules 
for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes 
of implementing tariff treatment under the CAFTA-DR. Section 
203(f)(3)(A)(ii) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``CAFTA-DR Act'') (19 
U.S.C. 4033) provides rules of origin for certain yarns described in 
section 204(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV) of the Andean Trade Preference Act (19 
U.S.C. 3203(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV)) (as in effect on the date of enactment of 
the CAFTA-DR Act).
25. Presidential Proclamations 8097 of December 29, 2006, and 8240 of 
April 17, 2008, modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) to 
conform it to amendments in the International Convention on the 
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the ``Convention''). 
They contained certain modifications that affected the rules of origin 
under the Andean Trade Preference Act. Modifications to the HTS are 
necessary to conform the rules of origin for certain yarns described in 
section 204(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV) of the Andean Trade Preference Act to the 
Convention. I have determined that additional conforming changes to the 
HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin under the 
CAFTA-DR.
26. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions

To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) 
(AGOA), authorizes the President to designate a country listed in 
section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets the 
eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 
3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an ``eligible sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.
3. Section 112(c) of the AGOA, as added in section 6002 of the Africa 
Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (Division D, title VI of Public Law 
109-432) (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)), provides special rules for certain apparel 
articles imported from ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries.''
4. In Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, President Clinton designated 
the Republic of Guinea (Guinea), the Republic of Madagascar 
(Madagascar), and the Republic of Niger (Niger) as beneficiary sub-
Saharan African countries pursuant to section 506A(a) of the 1974 Act 
and provided that they would be considered lesser developed beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 112(b)(3)(B) 
(subsequently redesignated as section 112(c)) of the AGOA.
5. Section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) authorizes 
the President to terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A if he 
determines that the country is not making continual progress in meeting 
the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act.
6. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 
1974 Act, I have determined that the Islamic Republic of Mauritania 
(Mauritania) meets the eligibility requirements set forth or referenced 
therein, and I have decided to designate Mauritania as an eligible sub-
Saharan African country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country.
7. Mauritania satisfies the criterion for treatment as a ``lesser 
developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country'' under section 112(c) 
of the AGOA.
8. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger are not making continual progress in 
meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 
Act. Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the designations of 
Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger as beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
countries for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on 
January 1, 2010.
9. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes 
the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other 
acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), and title V and section 604 of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461-67, 2483), do proclaim that:

and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
(2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 16(a) 
to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list 
of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries ``Islamic Republic of 
Mauritania.''
(3) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, Mauritania is a lesser 
developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
(4) The designations of Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger as beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of section 506A of the 1974 
Act are terminated, effective on January 1, 2010.
(5) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning on January 1, 2010, 
Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger shall no longer be designated as 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, general note 16(a) to the HTS 
is modified by deleting ``Republic of Guinea,'' ``Republic of 
Madagascar,'' and ``Republic of Niger'' from the list of beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African countries.
Further, note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS is

Proclamation 8469 of December 31, 2009

40th Anniversary of the National Environmental Policy Act, 2010

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Forty years ago, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed 
into law with overwhelming bipartisan support, ushering in a new era of 
environmental awareness and citizen participation in government. NEPA 
elevated the role of environmental considerations in proposed Federal 
agency actions, and it remains the cornerstone of our Nation's modern 
environmental protections. On this anniversary, we celebrate this 
milestone in our Nation's rich history of conservation, and we renew our 
commitment to preserve our environment for the next generation.
NEPA was enacted to ``prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and 
biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man.'' It established 
concrete objectives for Federal agencies to enforce these principles, 
while emphasizing public involvement to give all Americans a role in 
protecting our environment. It also created the Council on Environmental 
Quality to lead our Government's conservation efforts and serve as the 
President's environmental advisor.
America's economic health and prosperity are inexorably linked to the 
productive and sustainable use of our environment. That is why NEPA 
remains a vital tool for my Administration as we work to protect our 
Nation's environment and revitalize our economy. The American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 reaffirmed NEPA's role in protecting public 
health, safety, and environmental quality, and in ensuring transparency, 
accountability, and public involvement in our Government.
Today, my Administration will recognize NEPA's enactment by recommitting 
to environmental quality through open, accountable, and responsible 
decision making that involves the American public. Our Nation's long-
term prosperity depends upon our faithful stewardship of the air we 
breathe, the water we drink, and the land we sow. With smart, 
sustainable policies like those established under NEPA, we can meet our 
responsibility to future generations of Americans, so they may hope to 
enjoy the beauty and utility of a clean, healthy planet.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 1, 2010, as 
the 40th Anniversary of the National Environmental Policy Act. I call 
upon all executive branch agencies to promote public involvement and 
transparency in their implementation of the National Environmental 
Policy Act. I also encourage every American to learn more about the 
National Environmental Policy Act and how we can all contribute to 
protecting and enhancing our environment.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day 
of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
fourth.
BARACK OBAMA

    (e) ``Fitness determination'' means a decision by an agency that an 
individual has or does not have the required level of character and 
conduct necessary to perform work for or on behalf of a Federal agency 
as an employee in the excepted service (other than a position subject to 
suitability) or as a contractor employee. A favorable fitness 
determination is not a decision to appoint or contract with an 
individual.

heads also have the discretion to determine whether their criteria are 
equivalent to suitability standards established by the Office of 
Personnel Management. Agency heads shall take into account Office of 
Personnel Management guidance when exercising this discretion.
 Sec. 4.  Reciprocal Recognition of Fitness and Suitability 
Determinations. (a) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this 
section, agencies making fitness determinations shall grant reciprocal 
recognition to a prior favorable fitness or suitability determination 
when:

  (i) the gaining agency uses criteria for making fitness determinations 
equivalent to suitability standards established by the Office of Personnel 
Management;

  (ii) the prior favorable fitness or suitability determination was based 
on criteria equivalent to suitability standards established by the Office 
of Personnel Management; and

  (iii) the individual has had no break in employment since the favorable 
determination was made.

    (b) Exceptions to Reciprocal Recognition. A gaining agency is not 
required to grant reciprocal recognition to a prior favorable fitness or 
suitability determination when:

  (i) the new position requires a higher level of investigation than 
previously conducted for that individual;

  (ii) an agency obtains new information that calls into question the 
individual's fitness based on character or conduct; or

  (iii) the individual's investigative record shows conduct that is 
incompatible with the core duties of the new position.

 Sec. 5.  Reinvestigation of Individuals in Positions of Public Trust. 
Individuals in positions of public trust shall be subject to 
reinvestigation under standards (including but not limited to the 
frequency of such reinvestigation) as determined by the Director of the 
Office of Personnel Management, to ensure their suitability for 
continued employment.
 Sec. 6.  Responsibilities. (a) An agency shall report to the Office of 
Personnel Management the nature and results of the background 
investigation and fitness determination (or later changes to that 
determination) made on an individual, to the extent consistent with law.
    (b) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is delegated 
authority to implement this order, including the authority to issue 
regulations and guidance governing suitability, or guidance related to 
fitness, as the Director determines appropriate.
 Sec. 7. General Provisions.  (a) Nothing in this order shall be 
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

  (i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order shall not suspend, impede, or otherwise affect 
Executive Order 10450 of April 27, 1953, as amended, or Executive Order 
13467 of June 30, 2008;
    (d) This order is intended only to improve the internal management 
of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its agencies, 
instrumentalities, or entities, its officers, employees or agents, or 
any other person.
 Sec. 8.  Effective Date and Applicability. This order is effective upon 
issuance and is applicable to individuals newly appointed to excepted 
service positions or hired as contractor employees beginning 90 days 
from the effective date of this order.

Executive Order 13489 of January 21, 2009

Presidential Records

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish policies 
and procedures governing the assertion of executive privilege by 
incumbent and former Presidents in connection with the release of 
Presidential records by the National Archives and Records Administration 
(NARA) pursuant to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
    (a) ``Archivist'' refers to the Archivist of the United States or 
his designee.
    (b) ``NARA'' refers to the National Archives and Records 
Administration.
    (c) ``Presidential Records Act'' refers to the Presidential Records 
Act, 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207.
    (d) ``NARA regulations'' refers to the NARA regulations implementing 
the Presidential Records Act, 36 C.F.R. Part 1270.
    (e) ``Presidential records'' refers to those documentary materials 
maintained by NARA pursuant to the Presidential Records Act, including 
Vice Presidential records.
    (f) ``Former President'' refers to the former President during whose 
term or terms of office particular Presidential records were created.
    (g) A ``substantial question of executive privilege'' exists if 
NARA's disclosure of Presidential records might impair national security 
(including the conduct of foreign relations), law enforcement, or the 
deliberative processes of the executive branch.
    (h) A ``final court order'' is a court order from which no appeal 
may be taken.
Sec. 2. Notice of Intent to Disclose Presidential Records. (a) When the 
Archivist provides notice to the incumbent and former Presidents of his 
intent to disclose Presidential records pursuant to section 1270.46 of 
the NARA regulations, the Archivist, using any guidelines provided by 
the incumbent and former Presidents, shall identify any specific 
materials, the disclosure of which he believes may raise a substantial 
question of executive privilege. However, nothing in this order is 
intended to affect the right of the incumbent or former Presidents to 
invoke executive privilege with respect to materials not identified by 
the Archivist. Copies of the notice for the incumbent President shall be 
delivered to the President (through the Counsel to the President) and 
the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the 
Office of Legal Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former 
President shall be delivered to the former President or his designated 
representative.
    (b) Upon the passage of 30 days after receipt by the incumbent and 
former Presidents of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential 
records, the Archivist may disclose the records covered by the notice, 
unless during that time period the Archivist has received a claim of 
executive privilege by the incumbent or former President or the 
Archivist has been instructed by the incumbent President or his designee 
to extend the time period for a time certain and with reason for the 
extension of time provided in the notice. If a shorter period of time is 
required under the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the 
NARA regulations, the Archivist shall so indicate in the notice.
Sec. 3. Claim of Executive Privilege by Incumbent President. (a) Upon 
receipt of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential records, the 
Attorney General (directly or through the Assistant Attorney General for 
the Office of Legal Counsel) and the Counsel to the President shall 
review as they deem appropriate the records covered by the notice and 
consult with each other, the Archivist, and such other executive 
agencies as they deem appropriate concerning whether invocation of 
executive privilege is justified.
    (b) The Attorney General and the Counsel to the President, in the 
exercise of their discretion and after appropriate review and 
consultation under subsection (a) of this section, may jointly determine 
that invocation of executive privilege is not justified. The Archivist 
shall be notified promptly of any such determination.
    (c) If either the Attorney General or the Counsel to the President 
believes that the circumstances justify invocation of executive 
privilege, the issue shall be presented to the President by the Counsel 
to the President and the Attorney General.
    (d) If the President decides to invoke executive privilege, the 
Counsel to the President shall notify the former President, the 
Archivist, and the Attorney General in writing of the claim of privilege 
and the specific Presidential records to which it relates. After 
receiving such notice, the Archivist shall not disclose the privileged 
records unless directed to do so by an incumbent President or by a final 
court order.
Sec. 4. Claim of Executive Privilege by Former President. (a) Upon 
receipt of a claim of executive privilege by a living former President, 
the Archivist shall consult with the Attorney General (through the 
Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel), the Counsel 
to the President, and such other executive agencies as the Archivist 
deems appropriate concerning the Archivist's determination as to whether 
to honor the former President's claim of privilege or instead to 
disclose the Presidential records notwithstanding the claim of 
privilege. Any determination under section 3 of this order that 
executive privilege shall not be invoked by the incumbent President 
shall not prejudice the Archivist's determination with respect to the 
former President's claim of privilege.
    (b) In making the determination referred to in subsection (a) of 
this section, the Archivist shall abide by any instructions given him by 
the incumbent President or his designee unless otherwise directed by a 
final court order. The Archivist shall notify the incumbent and former 
Presidents of his determination at least 30 days prior to disclosure of 
the Presidential records, unless a shorter time period is required in 
the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations. 
Copies of the notice for the incumbent President shall be delivered to 
the President (through the Counsel to the President) and the Attorney 
General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal 
Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President shall be 
delivered to the former President or his designated representative.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

  (i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 6. Revocation. Executive Order 13233 of November 1, 2001, is 
revoked.

  (iv) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in 
Time of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3516).

    (f) ``Treated humanely,'' ``violence to life and person,'' ``murder 
of all kinds,'' ``mutilation,'' ``cruel treatment,'' ``torture,'' 
``outrages upon personal dignity,'' and ``humiliating and degrading 
treatment'' refer to, and have the same meaning as, those same terms in 
Common Article 3.
    (g) The terms ``detention facilities'' and ``detention facility'' in 
section 4(a) of this order do not refer to facilities used only to hold 
people on a short-term, transitory basis.
Sec. 3. Standards and Practices for Interrogation of Individuals in the 
Custody or Control of the United States in Armed Conflicts.
    (a) Common Article 3 Standards as a Minimum Baseline. Consistent 
with the requirements of the Federal torture statute, 18 U.S.C. 2340-
2340A, section 1003 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, 42 U.S.C. 
2000dd, the Convention Against Torture, Common Article 3, and other laws 
regulating the treatment and interrogation of individuals detained in 
any armed conflict, such persons shall in all circumstances be treated 
humanely and shall not be subjected to violence to life and person 
(including murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment, and 
torture), nor to outrages upon personal dignity (including humiliating 
and degrading treatment), whenever such individuals are in the custody 
or under the effective control of an officer, employee, or other agent 
of the United States Government or detained within a facility owned, 
operated, or controlled by a department or agency of the United States.
    (b) Interrogation Techniques and Interrogation-Related Treatment. 
Effective immediately, an individual in the custody or under the 
effective control of an officer, employee, or other agent of the United 
States Government, or detained within a facility owned, operated, or 
controlled by a department or agency of the United States, in any armed 
conflict, shall not be subjected to any interrogation technique or 
approach, or any treatment related to interrogation, that is not 
authorized by and listed in Army Field Manual 2-22.3 (Manual). 
Interrogation techniques, approaches, and treatments described in the 
Manual shall be implemented strictly in accord with the principles, 
processes, conditions, and limitations the Manual prescribes. Where 
processes required by the Manual, such as a requirement of approval by 
specified Department of Defense officials, are inapposite to a 
department or an agency other than the Department of Defense, such a 
department or agency shall use processes that are substantially 
equivalent to the processes the Manual prescribes for the Department of 
Defense. Nothing in this section shall preclude the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, or other Federal law enforcement agencies, from 
continuing to use authorized, non-coercive techniques of interrogation 
that are designed to elicit voluntary statements and do not involve the 
use of force, threats, or promises.
    (c) Interpretations of Common Article 3 and the Army Field Manual. 
From this day forward, unless the Attorney General with appropriate 
consultation provides further guidance, officers, employees, and other 
agents of the United States Government may, in conducting 
interrogations, act in reliance upon Army Field Manual 2-22.3, but may 
not, in conducting interrogations, rely upon any interpretation of the 
law governing interrogation--including interpretations of Federal 
criminal laws, the Convention Against Torture, Common Article 3, Army 
Field Manual 2-22.3, and its predecessor document, Army Field Manual 34-
52--issued by the Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and 
January 20, 2009.
Sec. 4. Prohibition of Certain Detention Facilities, and Red Cross 
Access to Detained Individuals.
    (a) CIA Detention. The CIA shall close as expeditiously as possible 
any detention facilities that it currently operates and shall not 
operate any such detention facility in the future.
    (b) International Committee of the Red Cross Access to Detained 
Individuals. All departments and agencies of the Federal Government 
shall provide the International Committee of the Red Cross with 
notification of, and timely access to, any individual detained in any 
armed conflict in the custody or under the effective control of an 
officer, employee, or other agent of the United States Government or 
detained within a facility owned, operated, or controlled by a 
department or agency of the United States Government, consistent with 
Department of Defense regulations and policies.
Sec. 5. Special Interagency Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer 
Policies.
    (a) Establishment of Special Interagency Task Force. There shall be 
established a Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer Policies 
(Special Task Force) to review interrogation and transfer policies.
    (b) Membership. The Special Task Force shall consist of the 
following members, or their designees:

  (i) the Attorney General, who shall serve as Chair;

  (ii) the Director of National Intelligence, who shall serve as Co-Vice-
Chair;

  (iii) the Secretary of Defense, who shall serve as Co-Vice-Chair;

  (iv) the Secretary of State;

  (v) the Secretary of Homeland Security;

  (vi) the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency;

  (vii) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and

  (viii) other officers or full-time or permanent part-time employees of 
the United States, as determined by the Chair, with the concurrence of the 
head of the department or agency concerned.

    (c) Staff. The Chair may designate officers and employees within the 
Department of Justice to serve as staff to support the Special Task 
Force. At the request of the Chair, officers and employees from other 
departments or agencies may serve on the Special Task Force with the 
concurrence of the head of the department or agency that employ such 
individuals. Such staff must be officers or full-time or permanent part-
time employees of the United States. The Chair shall designate an 
officer or employee of the Department of Justice to serve as the 
Executive Secretary of the Special Task Force.
    (d) Operation. The Chair shall convene meetings of the Special Task 
Force, determine its agenda, and direct its work. The Chair may 
establish and direct subgroups of the Special Task Force, consisting 
exclusively of members of the Special Task Force, to deal with 
particular subjects.
    (e) Mission. The mission of the Special Task Force shall be:

  (i) to study and evaluate whether the interrogation practices and 
techniques in Army Field Manual 2-22.3, when employed by departments or 
agencies outside the military, provide an appropriate means of acquiring 
the intelligence necessary to protect the Nation, and, if warranted, to 
recommend any additional or different guidance for other departments or 
agencies; and

  (ii) to study and evaluate the practices of transferring individuals to 
other nations in order to ensure that such practices comply with the 
domestic laws, international obligations, and policies of the United States 
and do not result in the transfer of individuals to other nations to face 
torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or 
circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure 
the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.

    (f) Administration. The Special Task Force shall be established for 
administrative purposes within the Department of Justice and the

unless the Chair determines that an extension is necessary.
    (h) Termination. The Chair shall terminate the Special Task Force 
upon the completion of its duties.
Sec. 6. Construction with Other Laws. Nothing in this order shall be 
construed to affect the obligations of officers, employees, and other 
agents of the United States Government to comply with all pertinent laws 
and treaties of the United States governing detention and interrogation, 
including but not limited to: the Fifth and Eighth Amendments to the 
United States Constitution; the Federal torture statute, 18 U.S.C. 2340-
2340A; the War Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. 2441; the Federal assault statute,

section 6(c) of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Public Law 109-
366; the Geneva Conventions; and the Convention Against Torture. Nothing 
in this order shall be construed to diminish any rights that any 
individual may have under these or other laws and treaties. This order

Executive Order 13492 of January 22, 2009

Review and Disposition of Individuals Detained At the Guant[aacute]namo 
Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, in order to effect the appropriate 
disposition of individuals currently detained by the Department of 
Defense at the Guant[aacute]namo Bay Naval Base (Guant[aacute]namo) and 
promptly to close detention facilities at Guant[aacute]namo, consistent 
with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United 
States and the interests of justice, I hereby order as follows:
Section 1. Definitions. As used in this order:
    (a) ``Common Article 3'' means Article 3 of each of the Geneva 
Conventions.
    (b) ``Geneva Conventions'' means:

  (i) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded 
and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3114);

  (ii) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, 
Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 
3217);

  (iii) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, 
August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3316); and

  (iv) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in 
Time of War, August 12, 1949 (6 UST 3516).

    (c) ``Individuals currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo'' and 
``individuals covered by this order'' mean individuals currently 
detained by the Department of Defense in facilities at the 
Guant[aacute]namo Bay Naval Base whom the Department of Defense has ever 
determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants.
Sec. 2. Findings.
    (a) Over the past 7 years, approximately 800 individuals whom the 
Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy 
combatants have been detained at Guant[aacute]namo. The Federal 
Government has moved more than 500 such detainees from 
Guant[aacute]namo, either by returning them to their home country or by 
releasing or transferring them to a third country. The Department of 
Defense has determined that a number of the individuals currently 
detained at Guant[aacute]namo are eligible for such transfer or release.
    (b) Some individuals currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo have 
been there for more than 6 years, and most have been detained for at 
least 4 years. In view of the significant concerns raised by these 
detentions, both within the United States and internationally, prompt 
and appropriate disposition of the individuals currently detained at 
Guant[aacute]namo and closure of the facilities in which they are 
detained would further the national security and foreign policy 
interests of the United States and the interests of justice. Merely 
closing the facilities without promptly determining the appropriate 
disposition of the individuals detained would not adequately serve those 
interests. To the extent practicable, the prompt and appropriate 
disposition of the individuals detained at Guant[aacute]namo should 
precede the closure of the detention facilities at Guant[aacute]namo.
    (c) The individuals currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo have the 
constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Most of those 
individuals have filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal 
court challenging the lawfulness of their detention.
    (d) It is in the interests of the United States that the executive 
branch undertake a prompt and thorough review of the factual and legal 
bases for the continued detention of all individuals currently held at 
Guant[aacute]namo, and of whether their continued detention is in the 
national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and 
in the interests of justice. The unusual circumstances associated with 
detentions at Guant[aacute]namo require a comprehensive interagency 
review.
    (e) New diplomatic efforts may result in an appropriate disposition 
of a substantial number of individuals currently detained at 
Guant[aacute]namo.
    (f) Some individuals currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo may 
have committed offenses for which they should be prosecuted. It is in 
the interests of the United States to review whether and how any such 
individuals can and should be prosecuted.
    (g) It is in the interests of the United States that the executive 
branch conduct a prompt and thorough review of the circumstances of the 
individuals currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo who have been 
charged with offenses before military commissions pursuant to the 
Military Commissions Act of 2006, Public Law 109-366, as well as of the 
military commission process more generally.
Sec. 3. Closure of Detention Facilities at Guant[aacute]namo. The 
detention facilities at Guant[aacute]namo for individuals covered by 
this order shall be closed as soon as practicable, and no later than 1 
year from the date of this order. If any individuals covered by this 
order remain in detention at Guant[aacute]namo at the time of closure of 
those detention facilities, they shall be returned to their home 
country, released, transferred to a third country, or transferred to 
another United States detention facility in a manner consistent with law 
and the national security and foreign policy interests of the United 
States.
Sec. 4. Immediate Review of All Guant[aacute]namo Detentions.
    (a) Scope and Timing of Review. A review of the status of each 
individual currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo (Review) shall 
commence immediately.
    (b) Review Participants. The Review shall be conducted with the full 
cooperation and participation of the following officials:

  (1) the Attorney General, who shall coordinate the Review;

  (2) the Secretary of Defense;

military, and legal expertise, as determined by the Attorney General, with 
the concurrence of the head of the department or agency concerned.

    (c) Operation of Review. The duties of the Review participants shall 
include the following:

  (1) Consolidation of Detainee Information. The Attorney General shall, to 
the extent reasonably practicable, and in coordination with the other 
Review participants, assemble all information in the possession of the 
Federal Government that pertains to any individual currently detained at 
Guant[aacute]namo and that is relevant to determining the proper 
disposition of any such individual. All executive branch departments and 
agencies shall promptly comply with any request of the Attorney General to 
provide information in their possession or control pertaining to any such 
individual. The Attorney General may seek further information relevant to 
the Review from any source.

  (2) Determination of Transfer. The Review shall determine, on a rolling 
basis and as promptly as possible with respect to the individuals currently 
detained at Guant[aacute]namo, whether it is possible to transfer or 
release the individuals consistent with the national security and foreign 
policy interests of the United States and, if so, whether and how the 
Secretary of Defense may effect their transfer or release. The Secretary of 
Defense, the Secretary of State, and, as appropriate, other Review 
participants shall work to effect promptly the release or transfer of all 
individuals for whom release or transfer is possible.

  (3) Determination of Prosecution. In accordance with United States law, 
the cases of individuals detained at Guant[aacute]namo not approved for 
release or transfer shall be evaluated to determine whether the Federal 
Government should seek to prosecute the detained individuals for any 
offenses they may have committed, including whether it is feasible to 
prosecute such individuals before a court established pursuant to Article 
III of the United States Constitution, and the Review participants shall in 
turn take the necessary and appropriate steps based on such determinations.

  (4) Determination of Other Disposition. With respect to any individuals 
currently detained at Guant[aacute]namo whose disposition is not achieved 
under paragraphs (2) or (3) of this subsection, the Review shall select 
lawful means, consistent with the national security and foreign policy 
interests of the United States and the interests of justice, for the 
disposition of such individuals. The appropriate authorities shall promptly 
implement such dispositions.

  (5) Consideration of Issues Relating to Transfer to the United States. 
The Review shall identify and consider legal, logistical, and security 
issues relating to the potential transfer of individuals currently detained 
at Guant[aacute]namo to facilities within the United States, and the Review 
participants shall work with the Congress on any legislation that may be 
appropriate.

Sec. 5. Diplomatic Efforts. The Secretary of State shall expeditiously 
pursue and direct such negotiations and diplomatic efforts with foreign 
governments as are necessary and appropriate to implement this order.
Sec. 6. Humane Standards of Confinement. No individual currently 
detained at Guant[aacute]namo shall be held in the custody or under the 
effective control of any officer, employee, or other agent of the United 
States Government, or at a facility owned, operated, or controlled by a 
department or agency of the United States, except in conformity with all 
applicable laws governing the conditions of such confinement, including 
Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. The Secretary of Defense 
shall immediately undertake a review of the conditions of detention at 
Guant[aacute]namo to ensure full compliance with this directive. Such 
review shall be completed within 30 days and any necessary corrections 
shall be implemented immediately thereafter.
Sec. 7. Military Commissions. The Secretary of Defense shall immediately 
take steps sufficient to ensure that during the pendency of the Review 
described in section 4 of this order, no charges are sworn, or referred 
to a military commission under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and 
the Rules for Military Commissions, and that all proceedings of such 
military commissions to which charges have been referred but in which no 
judgment has been rendered, and all proceedings pending in the United 
States Court of Military Commission Review, are halted.
Sec. 8. General Provisions.
    (a) Nothing in this order shall prejudice the authority of the 
Secretary of Defense to determine the disposition of any detainees not 
covered by this order.
    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Economy in Government Contracting

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., it is hereby ordered 
that:
Section 1. To promote economy and efficiency in Government contracting, 
certain costs that are not directly related to the contractors' 
provision of goods and services to the Government shall be unallowable 
for payment, thereby directly reducing Government expenditures. This 
order is also consistent with the policy of the United States to remain 
impartial concerning any labor-management dispute involving Government 
contractors. This order does not restrict the manner in which recipients 
of Federal funds may expend those funds.
Sec. 2. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and 
services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration of 
Government contracts, contracting departments and agencies, when they 
enter into, receive proposals for, or make disbursements pursuant to a 
contract as to which certain costs are treated as unallowable, shall 
treat as unallowable the costs of any activities undertaken to persuade 
employees--whether employees of the recipient of the Federal 
disbursements or of any other entity--to exercise or not to exercise, or 
concerning the manner of exercising, the right to organize and bargain 
collectively through representatives of the employees' own choosing. 
Such unallowable costs shall be excluded from any billing, claim, 
proposal, or disbursement applicable to any such Federal Government 
contract.
Sec. 3. Notwithstanding section 2 of this order, contracting departments 
and agencies shall treat as allowable costs incurred in maintaining 
satisfactory relations between the contractor and its employees, 
including costs of labor-management committees, employee publications 
(other than those undertaken to persuade employees to exercise or not to 
exercise, or concerning the manner of exercising, the right to organize 
and bargain collectively), and other related activities. See 48 C.F.R. 
31.205-21.
Sec. 4. Examples of costs unallowable under section 2 of this order 
include the costs of the following activities, when they are undertaken 
to persuade employees to exercise or not to exercise, or concern the 
manner of exercising, rights to organize and bargain collectively:
    (a) preparing and distributing materials;
    (b) hiring or consulting legal counsel or consultants;
    (c) holding meetings (including paying the salaries of the attendees 
at meetings held for this purpose); and
    (d) planning or conducting activities by managers, supervisors, or 
union representatives during work hours.
Sec. 5. Within 150 days of the effective date of this order, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) shall adopt such rules and 
regulations and issue such orders as are deemed necessary and 
appropriate to carry out this order. Such rules, regulations, and orders 
shall minimize the costs of compliance for contractors and shall not 
interfere with the ability of contractors to engage in advocacy through 
activities for which they do not claim reimbursement.
Sec. 6. Each contracting department or agency shall cooperate with the 
FAR Council and provide such information and assistance as the FAR 
Council may require in the performance of its functions under this 
order.
Sec. 7. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (b) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 8. This order shall become effective immediately, and shall apply 
to contracts resulting from solicitations issued on or after the 
effective date of the action taken by the FAR Council under section 5 of 
this order.

Executive Order 13495 of January 30, 2009

Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts

When a service contract expires, and a follow-on contract is awarded for 
the same service, at the same location, the successor contractor or its 
subcontractors often hires the majority of the predecessor's employees. 
On some occasions, however, a successor contractor or its subcontractors 
hires a new work force, thus displacing the predecessor's employees.
The Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency 
are served when the successor contractor hires the predecessor's 
employees. A carryover work force reduces disruption to the delivery of 
services during the period of transition between contractors and 
provides the Federal Government the benefits of an experienced and 
trained work force that is familiar with the Federal Government's 
personnel, facilities, and requirements.
Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., 
and in order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government 
procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government that 
service contracts and solicitations for such contracts shall include a 
clause that requires the contractor, and its subcontractors, under a 
contract that succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar 
services at the same location, to offer those employees (other than 
managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor 
contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of 
the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the 
contract in positions for which they are qualified. There shall be no 
employment openings under the contract until such right of first refusal 
has been provided. Nothing in this order shall be construed to permit a 
contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any 
other Executive Order or law of the United States.
Sec. 2. Definitions.
    (a) ``Service contract'' or ``contract'' means any contract or 
subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or its 
contractors that is covered by the Service Contract Act of 1965, as 
amended, 41 U.S.C. 351 et seq., and its implementing regulations.
    (b) ``Employee'' means a service employee as defined in the Service 
Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. 357(b).
Sec. 3. Exclusions. This order shall not apply to:
    (a) contracts or subcontracts under the simplified acquisition 
threshold as defined in 41 U.S.C. 403;

contract and one or more nonfederal service contracts as part of a 
single job, provided that the employees were not deployed in a manner 
that was designed to avoid the purposes of this order.
Sec. 4. Authority to Exempt Contracts. If the head of a contracting 
department or agency finds that the application of any of the 
requirements of this order would not serve the purposes of this order or 
would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services 
on an economical and efficient basis, the head of such department or 
agency may exempt its department or agency from the requirements of any 
or all of the provisions of this order with respect to a particular 
contract, subcontract, or purchase order or any class of contracts,

Sec. 5. Contract Clause. The following contract clause shall be included 
in solicitations for and service contracts that succeed contracts for 
performance of the same or similar work at the same location:
``NONDISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS
    ``(a) Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, 
the contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise 
provided herein, in good faith offer those employees (other than 
managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the predecessor 
contract whose employment will be terminated as a result of award of 
this contract or the expiration of the contract under which the 
employees were hired, a right of first refusal of employment under this 
contract in positions for which employees are qualified. The contractor 
and its subcontractors shall determine the number of employees necessary 
for efficient performance of this contract and may elect to employ fewer 
employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with 
performance of the work. Except as provided in paragraph (b) there shall 
be no employment opening under this contract, and the contractor and any 
subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to any 
person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. The 
contractor and its subcontractors shall make an express offer of 
employment to each employee as provided herein and shall state the time 
within which the employee must accept such offer, but in no case shall 
the period within which the employee must accept the offer of employment 
be less than 10 days.
    ``(b) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (a) above, the 
contractor and any subcontractors (1) may employ under this contract any 
employee who has worked for the contractor or subcontractor for at least 
3 months immediately preceding the commencement of this contract and who 
would otherwise face lay-off or discharge, (2) are not required to offer 
a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor 
contractor who are not service employees within the meaning of the 
Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 357(b), and (3) are 
not required to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the 
predecessor contractor whom the contractor or any of its subcontractors 
reasonably believes, based on the particular employee's past 
performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job.
    ``(c) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-
41(n), the contractor shall, not less than 10 days before completion of 
this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the 
names of all service employees working under this contract and its 
subcontracts during the last month of contract performance. The list 
shall also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service 
employee under this contract and its predecessor contracts either with 
the current or predecessor contractors or their subcontractors. The 
Contracting Officer will provide the list to the successor contractor, 
and the list shall be provided on request to employees or their 
representatives.
    ``(d) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the 
Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the contractor or its 
subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this 
clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate 
sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the contractor or 
its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order (No.) --------------, 
the regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary, or as otherwise 
provided by law.
    ``(e) In every subcontract entered into in order to perform services 
under this contract, the contractor will include provisions that ensure 
that each subcontractor will honor the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
through (b) with respect to the employees of a predecessor subcontractor 
or subcontractors working under this contract, as well as of a 
predecessor contractor and its subcontractors. The subcontract shall 
also include provisions to ensure that the subcontractor will provide 
the contractor with the information about the employees of the 
subcontractor needed by the contractor to comply with paragraph 5(c), 
above. The contractor will take such action with respect to any such 
subcontract as may be directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing 
such provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-
compliance: provided, however, that if the contractor, as a result of 
such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or 
is threatened with such involvement, the contractor may request that the 
United States enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the 
United States.''
Sec. 6. Enforcement. (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) is 
responsible for investigating and obtaining compliance with this order. 
In such proceedings, the Secretary shall have the authority to issue 
final orders prescribing appropriate sanctions and remedies, including, 
but not limited to, orders requiring employment and payment of wages 
lost. The Secretary also may provide that where a contractor or 
subcontractor has failed to comply with any order of the Secretary or 
has committed willful violations of this order or the regulations issued 
pursuant thereto, the contractor or subcontractor, and its responsible 
officers, and any firm in which the contractor or subcontractor has a 
substantial interest, shall be ineligible to be awarded any contract of 
the United States for a period of up to 3 years. Neither an order for 
debarment of any contractor or subcontractor from further Government 
contracts under this section nor the inclusion of a contractor or 
subcontractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors shall be 
carried out without affording the contractor or subcontractor an 
opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) This order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act, 
and disputes regarding the requirement of the contract clause prescribed 
by section 5 of this order, to the extent permitted by law, shall be 
disposed of only as provided by the Secretary in regulations issued 
under this order. To the extent practicable, such regulations shall 
favor the resolution of disputes by efficient and informal alternative 
dispute resolution methods. The Secretary shall, in consultation with 
the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, issue regulations, within 
180 days of the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, to 
implement the requirements of this order. The Federal Acquisition 
Regulatory Council shall issue, within 180 days of the date of this 
order, to the extent permitted by law, regulations in the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion of the contract clause 
in Federal solicitations and contracts subject to this order.
Sec. 7. Revocation. Executive Order 13204 of February 17, 2001, is 
revoked.
Sec. 8. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application 
of such provision or amendment to any person or circumstance, is held to 
be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the 
provisions of such to any person or circumstances shall not be affected 
thereby.
Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

  (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. This 
order is not intended, however, to preclude judicial review of final 
decisions by the Secretary in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.
Sec. 10. Effective Date. This order shall become effective immediately 
and shall apply to solicitations issued on or after the effective date 
for the action taken by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council under 
section 6(b) of this order.

Executive Order 13496 of January 30, 2009

Notification of Employee Rights Under Federal Labor Laws

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., and in order to 
ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of 
Government contracts, it is hereby ordered that:
Section 1. Policy. This order is designed to promote economy and 
efficiency in Government procurement. When the Federal Government 
contracts for goods or services, it has a proprietary interest in 
ensuring that those contracts will be performed by contractors whose 
work will not be interrupted by labor unrest. The attainment of 
industrial peace is most easily achieved and workers' productivity is 
enhanced when workers are well informed of their rights under Federal 
labor laws, including the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. 
151 et seq. As the Act recognizes, ``encouraging the practice and 
procedure of collective bargaining and . . . protecting the exercise by 
workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and 
designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of 
negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment or other mutual 
aid or protection'' will ``eliminate the causes of certain substantial 
obstructions to the free flow of commerce'' and ``mitigate and eliminate 
these obstructions when they have occurred.'' 29 U.S.C. 151. Relying on 
contractors whose employees are informed of such rights under Federal 
labor laws facilitates the efficient and economical completion of the 
Federal Government's contracts.
Sec. 2. Contract Clause. Except in contracts exempted in accordance with 
section 3 of this order, all Government contracting departments and 
agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, include the following 
provisions in every Government contract, other than collective 
bargaining agreements as defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(8) and purchases 
under the simplified acquisition threshold as defined in the Office of 
Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 403.
``1. During the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to post a 
notice, of such size and in such form, and containing such content as 
the Secretary of Labor shall prescribe, in conspicuous places in and 
about its plants and offices where employees covered by the National 
Labor Relations Act engage in activities relating to the performance of 
the contract, including all places where notices to employees are 
customarily posted both physically and electronically. The notice shall 
include the information contained in the notice published by the 
Secretary of Labor in the Federal Register (Secretary's Notice).
    ``2. The contractor will comply with all provisions of the 
Secretary's Notice, and related rules, regulations, and orders of the 
Secretary of Labor.
    ``3. In the event that the contractor does not comply with any of 
the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) or (2) above, this contract 
may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and the 
contractor may be declared ineligible for further Government contracts 
in accordance with procedures authorized in or adopted pursuant to 
Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register] of [insert 
new date]. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are 
provided in Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register] 
of [insert new date], or by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary 
of Labor, or as are otherwise provided by law.
    ``4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1) 
through (3) above in every subcontract entered into in connection with 
this contract (unless exempted by rules, regulations, or orders of the 
Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 3 of Executive Order 
[number as provided by the Federal Register] of [insert new date]) so 
that such provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The 
contractor will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as 
may be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such 
provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-compliance: 
Provided, however, that if the contractor becomes involved in litigation 
with a subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, as a 
result of such direction, the contractor may request the United States 
to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United 
States.''
Sec. 3. Administration.
    (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall be responsible for the 
administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary shall adopt 
such rules and regulations and issue such orders as are necessary and 
appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.
    (b) Within 120 days of the effective date of this order, the 
Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking to prescribe the size, form, and 
content of the notice to be posted by a contractor under paragraph 1 of 
the contract clause described in section 2 of this order. Such notice 
shall describe the rights of employees under Federal labor laws, 
consistent with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.
    (c) Whenever the Secretary finds that an act of Congress, 
clarification of existing law by the courts or the National Labor 
Relations Board, or other circumstances make modification of the 
contractual provisions set out in subsection (a) of this section 
necessary to achieve the purposes of this order, the Secretary promptly 
shall issue such rules, regulations, or orders as are needed to cause 
the substitution or addition of appropriate contractual provisions in 
Government contracts thereafter entered into.
Sec. 4. Exemptions. (a) If the Secretary finds that the application of 
any of the requirements of this order would not serve the purposes of 
this order or would impair the ability of the Government to procure 
goods or services on an economical and efficient basis, the Secretary 
may exempt a contracting department or agency or group of departments or 
agencies from the requirements of any or all of the provisions of this 
order with respect to a particular contract or subcontract or any class 
of contracts or subcontracts.
    (b) The Secretary may, if the Secretary finds that special 
circumstances require an exemption in order to serve the national 
interest, exempt a contracting department or agency from the 
requirements of any or all of the provisions of section 2 of this order 
with respect to a particular contract or subcontract or class of 
contracts or subcontracts.
Sec. 5. Investigation.
    (a) The Secretary may investigate any Government contractor, 
subcontractor, or vendor to determine whether the contractual provisions 
required by section 2 of this order have been violated.
    Such investigations shall be conducted in accordance with procedures 
established by the Secretary.
    (b) The Secretary shall receive and investigate complaints by 
employees of a Government contractor or subcontractor, where such 
complaints allege a failure to perform or a violation of the contractual 
provisions required by section 2 of this order.
Sec. 6. Compliance.
    (a) The Secretary, or any agency or officer in the executive branch 
lawfully designated by rule, regulation, or order of the Secretary, may 
hold such hearings, public or private, regarding compliance with this 
order as the Secretary may deem advisable.
    (b) The Secretary may hold hearings, or cause hearings to be held, 
in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, prior to imposing, 
ordering, or recommending the imposition of sanctions under this order. 
Neither an order for cancellation, termination, or suspension of any 
contract or debarment of any contractor from further Government 
contracts under section 7(b) of this order nor the inclusion of a 
contractor on a published list of noncomplying contractors under section 
7(c) of this order shall be carried out without affording the contractor 
an opportunity for a hearing.
Sec. 7. Remedies. In accordance with such rules, regulations, or orders 
as the Secretary may issue or adopt, the Secretary may:
    (a) after consulting with the contracting department or agency, 
direct that department or agency to cancel, terminate, suspend, or cause 
to be cancelled, terminated, or suspended, any contract, or any portion 
or portions thereof, for failure of the contractor to comply with the 
contractual provisions required by section 2 of this order; contracts 
may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended absolutely, or continuance of 
contracts may be conditioned upon future compliance: Provided, that 
before issuing a directive under this subsection, the Secretary shall 
provide the head of the contracting department or agency an opportunity 
to offer written objections to the issuance of such a directive, which 
objections shall include a complete statement of reasons for the 
objections, among which reasons shall be a finding that completion of 
the contract is essential to the agency's mission: And provided further, 
that no directive shall be issued by the Secretary under this subsection 
so long as the head of the contracting department or agency, or his or 
her designee, continues to object to the issuance of such directive;
    (b) after consulting with each affected contracting department or 
agency, provide that one or more contracting departments or agencies 
shall refrain from entering into further contracts, or extensions or 
other modifications of existing contracts, with any noncomplying 
contractor, until such contractor has satisfied the Secretary that such 
contractor has complied with and will carry out the provisions of this 
order: Provided, that before issuing a directive under this subsection, 
the Secretary shall provide the head of each contracting department or 
agency an opportunity to offer written objections to the issuance of 
such a directive, which objections shall include a complete statement of 
reasons for the objections, among which reasons shall be a finding that 
further contracts or extensions or other modifications of existing 
contracts with the noncomplying contractor are essential to the agency's 
mission: And provided further, that no directive shall be issued by the 
Secretary under this subsection so long as the head of a contracting 
department or agency, or his or her designee, continues to object to the 
issuance of such directive; and

have, in the judgment of the Secretary, failed to comply with the 
provisions of this order or of related rules, regulations, and orders of 
the Secretary.

functions under this order.

authority vested in the Secretary by sections 5 through 9 of this order

Secretary shall develop recommendations on how better to effectuate 
those purposes.

provision that implements section 2 of this order.

February 17, 2001, is revoked. The heads of executive departments and 
agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, revoke expeditiously any 
orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies implementing or

Sec. 14. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the 
application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to 
be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of the 
provisions of such to any person or circumstances shall not be affected

Executive Order 13498 of February 5, 2009

Amendments to Executive Order 13199 and Establishment of the President's 
Advisory Council for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to strengthen the 
ability of faith-based and other neighborhood organizations to deliver 
services effectively in partnership with Federal, State, and local 
governments and with other private organizations, while preserving our 
fundamental constitutional commitments, it is hereby ordered:
Section 1. Amendments to Executive Order. Executive Order 13199 of 
January 29, 2001 (Establishment of White House Office of Faith-Based and 
Community Initiatives), is hereby amended:
    (a) by striking section 1, and inserting in lieu thereof the 
following:

``Section 1.   Policy.  Faith-based and other neighborhood organizations 
are vital to our Nation's ability to address the needs of low-income and 
other underserved persons and communities. The American people are key 
drivers of fundamental change in our country, and few institutions are 
closer to the people than our faith-based and other neighborhood 
organizations. It is critical that the Federal Government strengthen the 
ability of such organizations and other nonprofit providers in our 
neighborhoods to deliver services effectively in partnership with Federal, 
State, and local governments and with other private organizations, while 
preserving our fundamental constitutional commitments guaranteeing the 
equal protection of the laws and the free exercise of religion and 
forbidding the establishment of religion. The Federal Government can 
preserve these fundamental commitments while empowering faith-based and 
neighborhood organizations to deliver vital services in our communities, 
from providing mentors and tutors to school children to giving ex-offenders 
a second chance at work and a responsible life to ensuring that families 
are fed. The Federal Government must also ensure that any organization 
receiving taxpayers' dollars must be held accountable for its performance. 
Through rigorous evaluation, and by offering technical assistance, the 
Federal Government must ensure that organizations receiving Federal funds 
achieve measurable results in furtherance of valid public purposes.''

    (b) by substituting ``White House Office of Faith-Based and 
Neighborhood Partnerships'' for ``White House Office of Faith-Based and 
Community Initiatives'' each time it appears in the order; and by 
substituting ``Office'' for ``White House OFBCI'' each time it appears 
in the order.
    (c) in section 3, by inserting after subsection (b) the following 
new subsections:

``(c) to ensure that services paid for with Federal Government funds are 
provided in a manner consistent with fundamental constitutional commitments 
guaranteeing the equal protection of the laws and the free exercise of 
religion and prohibiting laws respecting an establishment of religion;

(d) to promote effective training for persons providing federally funded 
social services in faith-based and neighborhood organizations;

(e) to promote the better use of program evaluation and research, in order 
to ensure that organizations deliver services as specified in grant 
agreements, contracts, memoranda of understanding, and other 
arrangements;'',

    and renumbering the subsequent subsections of section 3 accordingly.
    (d) in section 4, by striking the first sentence of subsection (b), 
and inserting in lieu thereof the following: ``The Office shall have a 
staff to be headed by the Special Assistant to the President and 
Executive Director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and 
Neighborhood Partnerships (Executive Director).''
Sec. 2. President's Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood 
Partnerships. (a) Establishment. There is established within the 
Executive Office of the President the President's Advisory Council on 
Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships (Council).
    (b) Mission. The Council shall bring together leaders and experts in 
fields related to the work of faith-based and neighborhood organizations 
in order to: identify best practices and successful modes of delivering 
social services; evaluate the need for improvements in the 
implementation and coordination of public policies relating to faith-
based and other neighborhood organizations; and make recommendations to 
the President, through the Executive Director, for changes in policies, 
programs, and practices that affect the delivery of services by such 
organizations and the needs of low-income and other underserved persons 
in communities at home and around the world.
    (c) Membership. (1) The Council shall be composed of not more than 
25 members appointed by the President from among individuals who are not 
officers or employees of the Federal Government. The members shall be 
persons with experience and expertise in fields related to the provision 
of social services by faith-based and other neighborhood organizations.

  (2) Members of the Council shall serve for terms of 1 year, and may 
continue to serve after the expiration of their terms until the President 
appoints a successor. Members shall be eligible for reappointment and serve 
at the pleasure of the President during their terms.

  (3) The President shall designate a member of the Council to serve as 
Chair for a term of 1 year at the pleasure of the President. The Chair may 
continue to serve after the expiration of the Chair's term and shall be 
eligible for redesignation by the President.

  (4) The Executive Director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and 
Neighborhood Partnerships shall also serve as Executive Director of the 
Council.

  (5) The Council shall have a staff headed by the Executive Director.

    (d)  Administration. (1) Upon the request of the Chair, with the 
approval of the Executive Director, the heads of executive departments

with information it needs for purposes of carrying out its mission.

(5 U.S.C. 5701-5707) to the extent funds are available.

  (5) To the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability of 
appropriations, the Department of Health and Human Services shall provide 
the Council with administrative support and with such funds as may be 
necessary for the performance of the Council's functions.

    (e) General Provisions.  (1) Insofar as the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.) (Act), may apply to the 
Council, any functions of the President under that Act, except for those 
in section 6 of the Act, shall be performed by the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services in accordance with guidelines issued by the 
Administrator of General Services.

  (2) The Council shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order 
unless extended by the President.

Sec. 3. General Provisions.  (a) Nothing in this order shall be

strength and competitiveness of the Nation's economy and the prosperity

nonpartisan information, analysis, and advice to the President as he

Section 1. There is hereby established within the Department of the 
Treasury the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board (PERAB). The 
PERAB shall consist of not more than 17 members, who shall be appointed

American people and of American industry that can serve to inform the

appropriate by the President, provide information and recommendations to 
any other agency with responsibilities related to the economy or 
financial markets or to the National Economic Council;
    (b) report directly to the President on the design, implementation,

Executive Order 13502 of February 6, 2009

Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., and in order to 
promote the efficient administration and completion of Federal 
construction projects, it is hereby ordered that:
Section 1. Policy. (a) Large-scale construction projects pose special 
challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the Federal 
Government. Construction employers typically do not have a permanent 
workforce, which makes it difficult for them to predict labor costs when 
bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply of labor on contracts 
being performed. Challenges also arise due to the fact that construction 
projects typically involve multiple employers at a single location. A 
labor dispute involving one employer can delay the entire project. A 
lack of coordination among various employers, or uncertainty about the 
terms and conditions of employment of various groups of workers, can 
create frictions and disputes in the absence of an agreed-upon 
resolution mechanism. These problems threaten the efficient and timely 
completion of construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors. 
On larger projects, which are generally more complex and of longer 
duration, these problems tend to be more pronounced.
    (b) The use of a project labor agreement may prevent these problems 
from developing by providing structure and stability to large-scale 
construction projects, thereby promoting the efficient and expeditious 
completion of Federal construction contracts. Accordingly, it is the 
policy of the Federal Government to encourage executive agencies to 
consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection 
with large-scale construction projects in order to promote economy and 
efficiency in Federal procurement.
Sec. 2. Definitions.
    (a) The term ``labor organization'' as used in this order means a 
labor organization as defined in 29 U.S.C. 152(5).
    (b) The term ``construction'' as used in this order means 
construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, repair, 
or improvement of buildings, highways, or other real property.
    (c) The term ``large-scale construction project'' as used in this 
order means a construction project where the total cost to the Federal 
Government is $25 million or more.
    (d) The term ``executive agency'' as used in this order has the same 
meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 105, but excludes the Government Accountability 
Office.
    (e) The term ``project labor agreement'' as used in this order means 
a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor 
organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment 
for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 
U.S.C. 158(f).
Sec. 3. (a) In awarding any contract in connection with a large-scale 
construction project, or obligating funds pursuant to such a contract, 
executive agencies may, on a project-by-project basis, require the use 
of a project labor agreement by a contractor where use of such an 
agreement will (i) advance the Federal Government's interest in 
achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing 
labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and 
regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, 
labor and employment standards, and other matters, and (ii) be 
consistent with law.
    (b) If an executive agency determines under subsection (a) that the 
use of a project labor agreement will satisfy the criteria in clauses 
(i) and (ii) of that subsection, the agency may, if appropriate, require 
that every contractor or subcontractor on the project agree, for that 
project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement 
with one or more appropriate labor organizations.
Sec. 4. Any project labor agreement reached pursuant to this order 
shall:
    (a) bind all contractors and subcontractors on the Construction 
project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all 
relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;
    (b) allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for 
contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are otherwise 
parties to collective bargaining agreements;
    (c) contain guarantees against strikes, lockouts, and similar job 
disruptions;
    (d) set forth effective, prompt, and mutually binding procedures for 
resolving labor disputes arising during the project labor agreement;
    (e) provide other mechanisms for labor-management cooperation on 
matters of mutual interest and concern, including productivity, quality 
of work, safety, and health;and
    (f) fully conform to all statutes, regulations, and Executive 
Orders.
Sec. 5. This order does not require an executive agency to use a project 
labor agreement on any construction project, nor does it preclude the 
use of a project labor agreement in circumstances not covered by this 
order, including leasehold arrangements and projects receiving Federal 
financial assistance. This order also does not require contractors or 
subcontractors to enter into a project labor agreement with any 
particular labor organization.
Sec. 6. Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council), to the extent permitted by 
law, shall take whatever action is required to amend the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation to implement the provisions of this order.
Sec. 7. The Director of OMB, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor 
and with other officials as appropriate, shall provide the President 
within 180 days of this order, recommendations about whether broader use 
of project labor agreements, with respect to both construction projects 
undertaken under Federal contracts and construction projects receiving 
Federal financial assistance, would help to promote the economical, 
efficient, and timely completion of such projects.
Sec. 8. Revocation of Prior Orders, Rules, and Regulations. Executive 
Order 13202 of February 17, 2001, and Executive Order 13208 of April 6, 
2001, are revoked. The heads of executive agencies shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, revoke expeditiously any orders, rules, or regulations 
implementing Executive Orders 13202 and 13208.
Sec. 9. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application 
of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, 
the remainder of this order and the application of the provisions of 
such to any person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
Sec. 10. General. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair 
or otherwise affect:

  (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 11. Effective Date. This order shall be effective immediately and 
shall apply to all solicitations for contracts issued on or after the 
effective date of the action taken by the FAR Council under section 6 of 
this order.

Executive Order 13503 of February 19, 2009

Establishment of the White House Office of Urban Affairs

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to take a coordinated 
and comprehensive approach to developing and implementing an effective 
strategy concerning urban America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. About 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas, 
and the economic health and social vitality of our urban communities are 
critically important to the prosperity and quality of life for 
Americans. Vibrant cities spawn innovation, economic growth, and 
cultural enrichment through the businesses, universities, and civic, 
cultural, religious, and nonprofit institutions they attract. Forward-
looking policies that encourage wise investment and development in our 
urban areas will create employment and housing opportunities and make 
our country more competitive, prosperous, and strong. In the past, 
insufficient attention has been paid to the problems faced by urban 
areas and to coordinating the many Federal programs that affect our 
cities. A more comprehensive approach is needed, both to develop an 
effective strategy for urban America and to coordinate the actions of 
the many executive departments and agencies whose actions impact urban 
life.
Sec. 2. Establishment. There is established within the Executive Office 
of the President the White House Office of Urban Affairs (the 
``Office'').
Sec. 3. Functions. The principal functions of the Office are, to the 
extent permitted by law:
    (a) to provide leadership for and coordinate the development of the 
policy agenda for urban America across executive departments and 
agencies;
    (b) to coordinate all aspects of urban policy;
    (c) to work with executive departments and agencies to ensure that 
appropriate consideration is given by such departments and agencies to 
the potential impact of their actions on urban areas;
    (d) to work with executive departments and agencies, including the 
Office of Management and Budget, to ensure that Federal Government 
dollars targeted to urban areas are effectively spent on the highest-
impact programs; and
    (e) to engage in outreach and work closely with State and local 
officials, with nonprofit organizations, and with the private sector, 
both in seeking input regarding the development of a comprehensive urban 
policy and in ensuring that the implementation of Federal programs 
advances the objectives of that policy.
Sec. 4. Coordination. In performing its functions, the Office shall work 
closely with all relevant executive departments and agencies, and 
offices and councils within the Executive Office of the President, 
including but not limited to:
    (a) the Department of the Treasury;
    (b) the Department of Justice;
    (c) the Department of Commerce;
    (d) the Department of Labor;
    (e) the Department of Health and Human Services;
    (f) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;
    (g) the Department of Transportation;
    (h) the Department of Energy;
    (i) the Department of Education; and
    (j) the Environmental Protection Agency.
Sec. 5. Administration. (a) The Office may work with established or ad 
hoc committees, task forces, and interagency groups.
    (b) The Office shall have a staff headed by the Deputy Assistant to 
the President and Director of Urban Affairs (Director). The Director 
shall report jointly to the Assistant to the President for 
Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Liaison and to the Assistant to the 
President for Domestic Policy. The Office shall have such staff and 
other assistance as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this 
order.
    (c) All executive departments and agencies shall cooperate with the 
Office and provide such information, support, and assistance to the 
Office as the Director may request, to the extent permitted by law.
Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

  (i) authority granted by law to a department, agency, or the head 
thereof; or

  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13505 of March 9, 2009

Removing Barriers to Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human 
Stem Cells

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Research involving human embryonic stem cells and 
human non-embryonic stem cells has the potential to lead to better 
understanding and treatment of many disabling diseases and conditions. 
Advances over the past decade in this promising scientific field have 
been encouraging, leading to broad agreement in the scientific community 
that the research should be supported by Federal funds.
For the past 8 years, the authority of the Department of Health and 
Human Services, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to 
fund and conduct human embryonic stem cell research has been limited by 
Presidential actions. The purpose of this order is to remove these 
limitations on scientific inquiry, to expand NIH support for the 
exploration of human stem cell research, and in so doing to enhance the 
contribution of America's scientists to important new discoveries and 
new therapies for the benefit of humankind.
Sec. 2. Research. The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
(Secretary), through the Director of NIH, may support and conduct 
responsible, scientifically worthy human stem cell research, including 
human embryonic stem cell research, to the extent permitted by law.
Sec. 3. Guidance. Within 120 days from the date of this order, the 
Secretary, through the Director of NIH, shall review existing NIH 
guidance and other widely recognized guidelines on human stem cell 
research, including provisions establishing appropriate safeguards, and 
issue new NIH guidance on such research that is consistent with this 
order. The Secretary, through NIH, shall review and update such guidance 
periodically, as appropriate.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented 
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of 
appropriations.
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

  (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

  (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 5. Revocations. (a) The Presidential statement of August 9, 2001, 
limiting Federal funding for research involving human embryonic stem 
cells, shall have no further effect as a statement of governmental 
policy.
    (b) Executive Order 13435 of June 20, 2007, which supplements the 
August 9, 2001, statement on human embryonic stem cell research, is 
revoked.

Executive Order 13506 of March 11, 2009

Establishing a White House Council on Women and Girls

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Over the past generation, our society has made 
tremendous progress in eradicating barriers to women's success. A record 
number of women are attending college and graduate school. Women make up 
a growing share of our workforce, and more women are corporate 
executives and business owners than ever before, helping boost the U.S. 
economy and foster U.S. competitiveness around the world. Today, women 
are serving at the highest levels of all branches of our Government.
Despite this progress, certain inequalities continue to persist. On 
average, American women continue to earn only about 78 cents for every 
dollar men make, and women are still significantly underrepresented in 
the science, engineering, and technology fields. Far too many women lack 
health insurance, and many are unable to take time off to care for a new 
baby or an ailing family member. Violence against women and girls 
remains a global epidemic. The challenge of ensuring equal educational 
opportunities for women and girls endures. As the current economic 
crisis has swept across our Nation, women have been seriously affected.
These issues do not concern just women. When jobs do not offer family 
leave, that affects men who wish to help care for their families. When 
women earn less than men for the same work, that affects families who 
have to work harder to make ends meet. When our daughters do not have 
the same educational and career opportunities as our sons, that affects 
entire communities, our economy, and our future as a Nation.
The purpose of this order is to establish a coordinated Federal response 
to issues that particularly impact the lives of women and girls and to 
ensure that Federal programs and policies address and take into account 
the distinctive concerns of women and girls, including women of color 
and those with disabilities.
Sec. 2. White House Council on Women and Girls. There is established 
within the Executive Office of the President a White House Council on 
Women and Girls (Council).

(a) Membership of the Council. The Council shall consist of the following 
members:

    (1) the Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President for 
Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Liaison, who shall serve as 
Chair of the Council;
    (2) the Secretary of State;
    (3) the Secretary of the Treasury;
    (4) the Secretary of Defense;
    (5) the Attorney General;
    (6) the Secretary of the Interior;
    (7) the Secretary of Agriculture;
    (8) the Secretary of Commerce;
    (9) the Secretary of Labor;
    (10) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;
    (11) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;
    (12) the Secretary of Transportation;
    (13) the Secretary of Energy;
    (14) the Secretary of Education;
    (15) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;
    (16) the Secretary of Homeland Security;
    (17) the Representative of the United States of America to the 
United Nations;
    (18) the United States Trade Representative;
    (19) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;
    (20) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;
    (21) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;
    (22) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management;
    (23) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;
    (24) the Assistant to the President and Director of the 
Domestic Policy Council;
    (25) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and 
Director of the National Economic Council; and
    (26) the heads of such other executive branch departments, 
agencies, and offices as the President may, from time to time, 
designate.

A member of the Council may designate, to perform the Council functions of 
the member, a senior-level official who is a part of the member's 
department, agency, or office, and who is a full-time officer or employee 
of the Federal Government. At the direction of the Chair, the Council may 
establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Council members or their 
designees under this section, as appropriate.

(b) Administration of the Council. The Department of Commerce shall provide 
funding and administrative support for the Council to the extent permitted 
by law and within existing appropriations. The Chair shall convene regular 
meetings of the Council, determine its agenda, and direct its work. The 
Chair shall designate an Executive Director of the Council, who shall 
coordinate the work of the Council and head any staff assigned to the 
Council.

Sec. 3. Mission and Functions of the Council. The Council shall work 
across executive departments and agencies to provide a coordinated 
Federal response to issues that have a distinct impact on the lives of 
women and girls, including assisting women-owned businesses to compete 
internationally and working to increase the participation of women in 
the science, engineering, and technology workforce, and to ensure that 
Federal programs and policies adequately take those impacts into 
account. The Council shall be responsible for providing recommendations 
to the President on the effects of pending legislation and executive 
branch policy proposals; for suggesting changes to Federal programs or 
policies to address issues of special importance to women and girls; for 
reviewing and recommending changes to policies that have a distinct 
impact on women in the Federal workforce; and for assisting in the 
development of legislative and policy proposals of special importance to 
women and girls. The functions of the Council are advisory only.
Sec. 4. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives set out in this order, 
the Council, in accordance with applicable law, in addition to regular 
meetings, shall conduct outreach with representatives of nonprofit 
organizations, State and local government agencies, elected officials, 
and other interested persons that will assist with the Council's 
development of a detailed set of recommendations.
Sec. 5. Federal Interagency Plan. The Council shall, within 150 days of 
the date of this order, develop and submit to the President a Federal 
interagency plan with recommendations for interagency action consistent 
with the goals of this order. The Federal interagency plan shall include 
an assessment by each member executive department, agency, or office of 
the status and scope of its efforts to further the progress and 
advancement of women and girls. Such an assessment shall include a 
report on the status of any offices or programs that have been created 
to develop, implement, or monitor targeted initiatives concerning women 
or girls. The Federal interagency plan shall also include 
recommendations for issues, programs, or initiatives that should be 
further evaluated or studied by the Council. The Council shall review 
and update the Federal interagency plan periodically, as appropriate, 
and shall present to the President any updated recommendations or 
findings.
Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) The heads of executive departments and 
agencies shall assist and provide information to the Council, consistent 
with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of 
the Council. Each executive department and agency shall bear its own 
expense for participating in the Council.

(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

    (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, 
agency, or the head thereof; or
    (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative 
proposals.

(c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any 
party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Establishment of the White House Office of Health Reform

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in the interest of providing 
all Americans access to affordable and high-quality health care, it is 
hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Reforming the health care system is a key goal of my 
Administration. The health care system suffers from serious and 
pervasive problems; access to health care is constrained by high and 
rising costs; and the quality of care is not consistent and must be 
improved, in order to improve the health of our citizens and our 
economic security.
Sec. 2. Establishment. (a) There is established a White House Office of 
Health Reform (Health Reform Office) within the Executive Office of the

Executive Order 13508 of May 12, 2009

Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America and in furtherance of the purposes 
of the Clean Water Act of 1972, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), and 
other laws, and to protect and restore the health, heritage, natural 
resources, and social and economic value of the Nation's largest 
estuarine ecosystem and the natural sustainability of its watershed, it 
is hereby ordered as follows:
PART 1--PREAMBLE
The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure constituting the largest 
estuary in the United States and one of the largest and most 
biologically productive estuaries in the world. The Federal Government 
has nationally significant assets in the Chesapeake Bay and its 
watershed in the form of public lands, facilities, military 
installations, parks, forests, wildlife refuges, monuments, and museums.
Despite significant efforts by Federal, State, and local governments and 
other interested parties, water pollution in the Chesapeake Bay prevents 
the attainment of existing State water quality standards and the 
``fishable and swimmable'' goals of the Clean Water Act. At the current 
level and scope of pollution control within the Chesapeake Bay's 
watershed, restoration of the Chesapeake Bay is not expected for many 
years. The pollutants that are largely responsible for pollution of the 
Chesapeake Bay are nutrients, in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus, 
and sediment. These pollutants come from many sources, including sewage 
treatment plants, city streets, development sites, agricultural 
operations, and deposition from the air onto the waters of the 
Chesapeake Bay and the lands of the watershed.
Restoration of the health of the Chesapeake Bay will require a renewed 
commitment to controlling pollution from all sources as well as 
protecting and restoring habitat and living resources, conserving lands, 
and improving management of natural resources, all of which contribute 
to improved water quality and ecosystem health. The Federal Government 
should lead this effort. Executive departments and agencies (agencies), 
working in collaboration, can use their expertise and resources to 
contribute significantly to improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay. 
Progress in restoring the Chesapeake Bay also will depend on the support 
of State and local governments, the enterprise of the private sector, 
and the stewardship provided to the Chesapeake Bay by all the people who 
make this region their home.
 PART 2--SHARED FEDERAL LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
Sec. 201. Federal Leadership Committee. In order to begin a new era of 
shared Federal leadership with respect to the protection and restoration 
of the Chesapeake Bay, a Federal Leadership Committee (Committee) for 
the Chesapeake Bay is established to oversee the development and 
coordination of programs and activities, including data management and 
reporting, of agencies participating in protection and restoration of 
the Chesapeake Bay. The Committee shall manage the development of 
strategies and program plans for the watershed and ecosystem of the 
Chesapeake Bay and oversee their implementation. The Committee shall be 
chaired by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), or the Administrator's designee, and include senior 
representatives of the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Commerce 
(DOC), Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), the Interior (DOI), 
Transportation (DOT), and such other agencies as determined by the 
Committee. Representatives serving on the Committee shall be officers of 
the United States.
Sec. 202. Reports on Key Challenges to Protecting and Restoring the 
Chesapeake Bay. Within 120 days from the date of this order, the 
agencies identified in this section as the lead agencies shall prepare 
and submit draft reports to the Committee making recommendations for 
accomplishing the following steps to protect and restore the Chesapeake 
Bay:
    (a) define the next generation of tools and actions to restore water 
quality in the Chesapeake Bay and describe the changes to be made to 
regulations, programs, and policies to implement these actions;
    (b) target resources to better protect the Chesapeake Bay and its 
tributary waters, including resources under the Food Security Act of 
1985 as amended, the Clean Water Act, and other laws;
    (c) strengthen storm water management practices at Federal 
facilities and on Federal lands within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and 
develop storm water best practices guidance;
    (d) assess the impacts of a changing climate on the Chesapeake Bay 
and develop a strategy for adapting natural resource programs and public 
infrastructure to the impacts of a changing climate on water quality and 
living resources of the Chesapeake Bay watershed;
    (e) expand public access to waters and open spaces of the Chesapeake 
Bay and its tributaries from Federal lands and conserve landscapes and 
ecosystems of the Chesapeake Bay watershed;
    (f) strengthen scientific support for decisionmaking to restore the 
Chesapeake Bay and its watershed, including expanded environmental 
research and monitoring and observing systems; and
    (g) develop focused and coordinated habitat and research activities 
that protect and restore living resources and water quality of the 
Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.
The EPA shall be the lead agency for subsection (a) of this section and 
the development of the storm water best practices guide under subsection 
(c). The USDA shall be the lead agency for subsection (b). The DOD shall 
lead on storm water management practices at Federal facilities and on 
Federal lands under subsection (c). The DOI and the DOC shall share the 
lead on subsections (d), (f), and (g), and the DOI shall be lead on 
subsection (e). The lead agencies shall provide final reports to the 
Committee within 180 days of the date of this order.
Sec. 203. Strategy for Protecting and Restoring the Chesapeake Bay. The 
Committee shall prepare and publish a strategy for coordinated 
implementation of existing programs and projects to guide efforts to 
protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay. The strategy shall, to the 
extent permitted by law:
    (a) define environmental goals for the Chesapeake Bay and describe 
milestones for making progress toward attainment of these goals;
    (b) identify key measureable indicators of environmental condition

including the programs and strategies described in draft reports 
developed under section 202 of this order;
    (d) identify the mechanisms that will assure that governmental and 
other activities, including data collection and distribution, are 
coordinated and effective, relying on existing mechanisms where 
appropriate; and
    (e) describe a process for the implementation of adaptive management 
principles, including a periodic evaluation of protection and 
restoration activities.
The Committee shall review the draft reports submitted by lead agencies 
under section 202 of this order and, in consultation with relevant State 
agencies, suggest appropriate revisions to the agency that provided the 
draft report. It shall then integrate these reports into a coordinated 
strategy for restoration and protection of the Chesapeake Bay consistent 
with the requirements of this order. Together with the final reports 
prepared by the lead agencies, the draft strategy shall be published for 
public review and comment within 180 days of the date of this order and 
a final strategy shall be published within 1 year. To the extent 
practicable and authorized under their existing authorities, agencies 
may begin implementing core elements of restoration and protection 
programs and strategies, in consultation with the Committee, as soon as 
possible and prior to release of a final strategy.
Sec. 204. Collaboration with State Partners. In preparing the reports 
under section 202 and the strategy under section 203, the lead agencies 
and the Committee shall consult extensively with the States of Virginia, 
Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, and Delaware and the 
District of Columbia. The goal of this consultation is to ensure that 
Federal actions to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay are closely 
coordinated with actions by State and local agencies in the watershed 
and that the resources, authorities, and expertise of Federal, State, 
and local agencies are used as efficiently as possible for the benefit 
of the Chesapeake Bay's water quality and ecosystem and habitat health 
and viability.
Sec. 205. Annual Action Plan and Progress Report. Beginning in 2010, the 
Committee shall publish an annual Chesapeake Bay Action Plan (Action 
Plan) describing how Federal funding proposed in the President's Budget 
will be used to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay during the 
upcoming fiscal year. This plan will be accompanied by an Annual 
Progress Report reviewing indicators of environmental conditions in the 
Chesapeake Bay, assessing implementation of the Action Plan during the 
preceding fiscal year, and recommending steps to improve progress in 
restoring and protecting the Chesapeake Bay. The Committee shall consult 
with stakeholders (including relevant State agencies) and members of the 
public in developing the Action Plan and Annual Progress Report.
Sec. 206. Strengthen Accountability. The Committee, in collaboration 
with State agencies, shall ensure that an independent evaluator 
periodically reports to the Committee on progress toward meeting the 
goals of this order. The Committee shall ensure that all program 
evaluation reports, including data on practice or system implementation 
and maintenance funded through agency programs, as appropriate, are made 
available to the public by posting on a website maintained by the Chair 
of the Committee.

Executive Order 13513 of October 1, 2009

Federal Leadership on Reducing Text Messaging While Driving

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 7902(c) of title 
5, United States Code, and the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., and in order to 
demonstrate Federal leadership in improving safety on our roads and 
highways and to enhance the efficiency of Federal contracting, it is 
hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. With nearly 3 million civilian employees, the Federal 
Government can and should demonstrate leadership in reducing the dangers 
of text messaging while driving. Recent deadly crashes involving drivers 
distracted by text messaging while behind the wheel highlight a growing 
danger on our roads. Text messaging causes drivers to take their eyes 
off the road and at least one hand off the steering wheel, endangering 
both themselves and others. Every day, Federal employees drive 
Government-owned, Government-leased, or Government-rented vehicles 
(collectively, GOV) or privately-owned vehicles (POV) on official 
Government business, and some Federal employees use Government-supplied 
electronic devices to text or e-mail while driving. A Federal 
Government-wide prohibition on the use of text messaging while driving 
on official business or while using Government-supplied equipment will 
help save lives, reduce injuries, and set an example for State and local 
governments, private employers, and individual drivers. Extending this 
policy to cover Federal contractors is designed to promote economy and 
efficiency in Federal procurement. Federal contractors and contractor 
employees who refrain from the unsafe practice of text messaging while 
driving in connection with Government business are less likely to 
experience disruptions to their operations that would adversely impact 
Federal procurement.
Sec. 2. Text Messaging While Driving by Federal Employees. Federal 
employees shall not engage in text messaging (a) when driving GOV, or 
when driving POV while on official Government business, or (b) when 
using electronic equipment supplied by the Government while driving.
Sec. 3. Scope of Order. (a) All agencies of the executive branch are 
directed to take appropriate action within the scope of their existing 
programs to further the policies of this order and to implement section 
2 of this order. This includes, but is not limited to, considering new 
rules and programs, and reevaluating existing programs to prohibit text 
messaging while driving, and conducting education, awareness, and other 
outreach for Federal employees about the safety risks associated with 
texting while driving. These initiatives should encourage voluntary 
compliance with the agency's text messaging policy while off duty.

(b) Within 90 days of the date of this order, each agency is directed, 
consistent with all applicable laws and regulations: (i) to take 
appropriate measures to implement this order, (ii) to adopt measures to 
ensure compliance with section 2 of this order, including through 
appropriate disciplinary actions, and (iii) to notify the Secretary of 
Transportation of the measures it undertakes hereunder.

(c) Agency heads may exempt from the requirements of this order, in whole 
or in part, certain employees, devices, or vehicles in their respective 
agencies that are engaged in or used for protective, law enforcement, or 
national security responsibilities or on the basis of other emergency 
conditions.

Sec. 4. Text Messaging While Driving by Government Contractors, 
Subcontractors, and Recipients and Subrecipients. Each Federal agency, 
in procurement contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, and other 
grants to the extent authorized by applicable statutory authority, 
entered into after the date of this order, shall encourage contractors, 
subcontractors, and recipients and subrecipients to adopt and enforce 
policies that ban text messaging while driving company-owned or -rented 
vehicles or GOV, or while driving POV when on official Government 
business or when performing any work for or on behalf of the Government. 
Agencies should also encourage Federal contractors, subcontractors, and 
grant recipients and subrecipients as described in this section to 
conduct initiatives of the type described in section 3(a) of this order.
Sec. 5. Coordination. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation 
with the Administrator of General Services and the Director of the 
Office of Personnel Management, shall provide leadership and guidance to 
the heads of executive branch agencies to assist them with any action 
pursuant to this order.
Sec. 6. Definitions.

(a) The term ``agency'' as used in this order means an executive agency, as 
defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, except for the Government Accountability Office.

(b) ``Texting'' or ``Text Messaging'' means reading from or entering data 
into any handheld or other electronic device, including for the purpose of 
SMS texting, e-mailing, instant messaging, obtaining navigational 
information, or engaging in any other form of electronic data retrieval or 
electronic data communication.

(c) ``Driving'' means operating a motor vehicle on an active roadway with 
the motor running, including while temporarily stationary because of 
traffic, a traffic light or stop sign, or otherwise. It does not include 
operating a motor vehicle with or without the motor running when one has 
pulled over to the side of, or off, an active roadway and has halted in a 
location where one can safely remain stationary.

Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect or alter:
    (i) Authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, 
or the head thereof;
    (ii) Powers and duties of the heads of the various departments 
and agencies pursuant to the Highway Safety Act of 1966, as 
amended, 23 U.S.C. 402 and 403, section 19 of the Occupational 
Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 668, sections 
7901 and 7902 of title 5, United States Code, or the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended, 40 
U.S.C. 101 et seq.;
    (iii) Rights, duties, or procedures under the National Labor 
Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.; or
    (iv) Functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative 
proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any 
party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009

Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and to establish an integrated 
strategy towards sustainability in the Federal Government and to make 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions a priority for Federal agencies, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. In order to create a clean energy economy that will 
increase our Nation's prosperity, promote energy security, protect the 
interests of taxpayers, and safeguard the health of our environment, the 
Federal Government must lead by example. It is therefore the policy of 
the United States that Federal agencies shall increase energy 
efficiency; measure, report, and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 
from direct and indirect activities; conserve and protect water 
resources through efficiency, reuse, and stormwater management; 
eliminate waste, recycle, and prevent pollution; leverage agency 
acquisitions to foster markets for sustainable technologies and 
environmentally preferable materials, products, and services; design, 
construct, maintain, and operate high performance sustainable buildings 
in sustainable locations; strengthen the vitality and livability of the 
communities in which Federal facilities are located; and inform Federal 
employees about and involve them in the achievement of these goals.
It is further the policy of the United States that to achieve these 
goals and support their respective missions, agencies shall prioritize 
actions based on a full accounting of both economic and social benefits 
and costs and shall drive continuous improvement by annually evaluating 
performance, extending or expanding projects that have net benefits, and 
reassessing or discontinuing under-performing projects.
Finally, it is also the policy of the United States that agencies' 
efforts and outcomes in implementing this order shall be transparent and 
that agencies shall therefore disclose results associated with the 
actions taken pursuant to this order on publicly available Federal 
websites.
Sec. 2. Goals for Agencies. In implementing the policy set forth in 
section 1 of this order, and preparing and implementing the Strategic 
Sustainability Performance Plan called for in section 8 of this order, 
the head of each agency shall:

(a) within 90 days of the date of this order, establish and report to the 
Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ Chair) and the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) a percentage 
reduction target for agency-wide reductions of scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas 
emissions in absolute terms by fiscal year 2020, relative to a fiscal year 
2008 baseline of the agency's scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Where 
appropriate, the target shall exclude direct emissions from excluded 
vehicles and equipment and from electric power produced and sold 
commercially to other parties in the course of regular business. This 
target shall be subject to review and approval by the CEQ Chair in 
consultation with the OMB Director under section 5 of this order. In 
establishing the target, the agency head shall consider reductions 
associated with:

    (i) reducing energy intensity in agency buildings;
    (ii) increasing agency use of renewable energy and 
implementing renewable energy generation projects on agency 
property; and
    (iii) reducing the use of fossil fuels by:

(b) within 240 days of the date of this order and concurrent with 
submission of the Strategic Sustainability Performance Plan as described in 
section 8 of this order, establish and report to the CEQ Chair and the OMB 
Director a percentage reduction target for reducing agency-wide scope 3 
greenhouse gas emissions in absolute terms by fiscal year 2020, relative to 
a fiscal year 2008 baseline of agency scope 3 emissions. This target shall 
be subject to review and approval by the CEQ Chair in consultation with the 
OMB Director under section 5 of this order. In establishing the target, the 
agency head shall consider reductions associated with:

    (i) pursuing opportunities with vendors and contractors to 
address and incorporate incentives to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions (such as changes to manufacturing, utility or delivery 
services, modes of transportation used, or other changes in supply 
chain activities);
    (ii) implementing strategies and accommodations for transit, 
travel, training, and conferencing that actively support lower-
carbon commuting and travel by agency staff;
    (iii) greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with 
pursuing other relevant goals in this section; and
    (iv) developing and implementing innovative policies and 
practices to address scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions unique to 
agency operations;

consumption in fiscal year 2007, by implementing water management 
strategies including water-efficient and low-flow fixtures and 
efficient cooling towers;
    (ii) reducing agency industrial, landscaping, and agricultural 
water consumption by 2 percent annually or 20 percent by the end 
of fiscal year 2020 relative to a baseline of the agency's 
industrial, landscaping, and agricultural water consumption in 
fiscal year 2010;
    (iii) consistent with State law, identifying, promoting, and 
implementing water reuse strategies that reduce potable water 
consumption; and
    (iv) implementing and achieving the objectives identified in 
the stormwater management guidance referenced in section 14 of 
this order;

(e) promote pollution prevention and eliminate waste by:

    (i) minimizing the generation of waste and pollutants through 
source reduction;
    (ii) diverting at least 50 percent of non-hazardous solid 
waste, excluding construction and demolition debris, by the end of

Executive Order 13515 of October 14, 2009

Increasing Participation of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in 
Federal Programs

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The more than 16 million Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders (AAPIs) across our country have helped build a strong and 
vibrant America. The AAPI communities represent many ethnicities and 
languages that span generations, and their shared achievements are an 
important part of the American experience. They have started businesses 
and generated jobs, including founding some of our Nation's most 
successful and innovative enterprises. The AAPI communities have made 
important contributions to science and technology, culture and the arts, 
and the professions, including business, law, medicine, education, and 
politics.
While we acknowledge the many contributions of the AAPI communities to 
our Nation, we also recognize the challenges still faced by many AAPIs. 
Of the more than a million AAPI-owned businesses, many firms are small 
sole-proprietorships that continue to need assistance to access 
available resources such as business development counseling and small 
business loans. The AAPI community also continues to face barriers to 
employment and workplace advancement. Specific challenges experienced by 
AAPI subgroups include lower college-enrollment rates by Pacific 
Islanders than other ethnic groups and high poverty rates among Hmong 
Americans, Cambodian Americans, Malaysian Americans, and other 
individual AAPI communities. Additionally, one in five non-elderly AAPIs 
lacks health insurance.
The purpose of this order is to establish a President's Advisory 
Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and a White House 
Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Each will work to 
improve the quality of life and opportunities for Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders through increased access to, and participation in, 
Federal programs in which they may be underserved. In addition, each 
will work to advance relevant evidence-based research, data collection, 
and analysis for AAPI populations and subpopulations.
Sec. 2. President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders. There is established in the Department of Education the 
President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
(Commission).
(a) Mission and Function of the Commission. The Commission shall provide 
advice to the President, through the Secretaries of Education and 
Commerce, as Co-Chairs of the Initiative described in section 3 of this 
order, on: (i) the development, monitoring, and coordination of 
executive branch efforts to improve the quality of life of AAPIs through 
increased participation in Federal programs in which such persons may be 
underserved; (ii) the compilation of research and data related to AAPI 
populations and subpopulations; (iii) the development, monitoring, and 
coordination of Federal efforts to improve the economic and community 
development of AAPI businesses; and (iv) strategies to increase public 
and private-sector collaboration, and community involvement in improving 
the health, education, environment, and well-being of AAPIs.
(b) Membership of the Commission. The Commission shall consist of not 
more than 20 members appointed by the President. The Commission shall 
include members who: (i) have a history of involvement with the AAPI 
communities; (ii) are from the fields of education, commerce, business, 
health, human services, housing, environment, arts, agriculture, labor 
and employment, transportation, justice, veterans affairs, and economic 
and community development; (iii) are from civic associations 
representing one or more of the diverse AAPI communities; or (iv) have 
such other experience as the President deems appropriate. The President 
shall designate one member of the Commission to serve as Chair, who 
shall convene regular meetings of the Commission, determine its agenda, 
and direct its work.
(c) Administration of the Commission. The Secretary of Education, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall designate an 
Executive Director for the Commission. The Department of Education shall 
provide funding and administrative support for the Commission to the 
extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. Members of 
the Commission shall serve without compensation, but shall be allowed 
travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as 
authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the Government 
service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707). Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.) (the ``Act''), may apply to the 
administration of the Commission, any functions of the President under 
the Act, except that of reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by 
the Secretary of Education, in accordance with the guidelines issued by 
the Administrator of General Services.
(d) Termination Date. The Commission shall terminate 2 years from the 
date of this order, unless renewed by the President.
Sec. 3. White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
There is established the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders (Initiative), a Federal interagency working group 
whose members shall be selected by their respective agencies. The 
Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Education shall serve as the 
Co-Chairs of the Initiative. The Executive Director of the Commission 
established in section 2 of this order shall also serve as the Executive 
Director of the Initiative and shall report to the Secretaries on 
Initiative matters.
(a) Mission and Function of the Initiative. The Initiative shall work to 
improve the quality of life of AAPIs through increased participation in 
Federal programs in which AAPIs may be underserved. The Initiative shall

designees under this section, as appropriate.
(c) Administration of the Initiative. The Department of Education shall 
provide funding and administrative support for the Initiative to the 
extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. The Co-
Chairs shall convene regular meetings of the Initiative, determine its 
agenda, and direct its work.
(d) Federal Agency Plans and Interagency Plan. Each executive department 
and agency designated by the Initiative shall prepare a plan (agency 
plan) for, and shall document, its efforts to improve the quality of 
life of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders through increased 
participation in Federal programs in which Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders may be underserved. Where appropriate, this agency plan shall 
address, among other things, the agency's efforts to:

(i) identify Federal programs in which AAPIs may be underserved and improve 
the quality of life for AAPIs through increased participation in these 
programs;

(ii) identify ways to foster the recruitment, career development, and 
advancement of AAPIs in the Federal Government;

and well-being of AAPIs, and implement those action items;

(iv) increase public-sector, private-sector, and community involvement in 
improving the health, environment, opportunity, and well-being of AAPIs;

(v) foster evidence-based research, data-collection, and analysis on AAPI

of that agency's performance on the goals set in the previous year's 
plan. Each agency plan shall be submitted to the Co-Chairs by a date to 
be established by the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chairs shall review the agency 
plans and develop for submission to the President a Federal interagency 
plan to improve the quality of life of AAPIs through increased 
participation in Federal programs in which such persons may be 
underserved. Actions described in the Federal interagency plan shall 
address improving access by AAPIs to Federal programs and fostering 
advances in relevant research and data.

Employment of Veterans in the Federal Government

By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States of America, including section 301 of title 3 of the United 
States Code, I hereby order as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Veterans have served and sacrificed in defense of our 
Nation. When they complete their service, we must do everything in our 
power to assist them in re-entering civilian life and finding 
employment. Government as well as private employers should play a 
prominent role in helping veterans who may be struggling to find jobs. 
As one of the Nation's leading employers, the Federal Government is in 
need of highly skilled individuals to meet agency staffing needs and to 
support mission objectives. Our veterans, who have benefited from 
training and development during their military service, possess a wide 
variety of skills and experiences, as well as the motivation for public 
service, that will help fulfill Federal agencies' staffing needs. It is 
therefore the policy of my Administration to enhance recruitment of and 
promote employment opportunities for veterans within the executive 
branch, consistent with merit system principles and veterans' 
preferences prescribed by law. The Federal Government will thereby help 
lead by example in promoting veterans' employment.
Sec. 2. Council on Veterans Employment. There is hereby established an 
interagency Council on Veterans Employment (Council), to be co-chaired 
by the Secretaries of Labor and Veterans Affairs. The Director of the 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall serve as Vice Chair of the 
Council.
(a) Mission and Function of the Council. The Council shall:

(i) advise and assist the President and the Director of OPM in establishing 
a coordinated Government-wide effort to increase the number of veterans 
employed by the Federal Government by enhancing recruitment and training;

(ii) serve as a national forum for promoting veterans' employment 
opportunities in the executive branch; and

(iii) establish performance measures to assess the effectiveness of, and 
submit an annual report to the President on the status of, the Veterans 
Employment Initiative described in section 3 of this order.

(b) Membership of the Council. The Council shall consist of the heads of 
the following agencies and such other executive branch agencies as the 
President may designate:

(i) the Department of State;

(ii) the Department of the Treasury;

(iii) the Department of Defense;

(iv) the Department of Justice;

Executive Order 13520 of November 20, 2009

Reducing Improper Payments

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in the interest of reducing 
payment errors and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal 
programs, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. When the Federal Government makes payments to 
individuals and businesses as program beneficiaries, grantees, or 
contractors, or on behalf of program beneficiaries, it must make every 
effort to confirm that the right recipient is receiving the right 
payment for the right reason at the right time. The purpose of this 
order is to reduce improper payments by intensifying efforts to 
eliminate payment error, waste, fraud, and abuse in the major programs 
administered by the Federal Government, while continuing to ensure that 
Federal programs serve and provide access to their intended 
beneficiaries. No single step will fully achieve these goals. Therefore, 
this order adopts a comprehensive set of policies, including 
transparency and public scrutiny of significant payment errors 
throughout the Federal Government; a focus on identifying and 
eliminating the highest improper payments; accountability for reducing 
improper payments among executive branch agencies and officials; and 
coordinated Federal, State, and local government action in identifying 
and eliminating improper payments. Because this order targets error, 
waste, fraud, and abuse--not legitimate use of Government services--
efforts to reduce improper payments under this order must protect access 
to Federal programs by their intended beneficiaries.
Sec. 2. Transparency and Public Participation.
(a) Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) shall:

(i) identify Federal programs in which the highest dollar value or majority 
of Government-wide improper payments occur (high-priority programs);

(ii) establish, in coordination with the executive department or agency 
(agency) responsible for administering the high-priority program annual or 
semi-annual targets (or where such targets already exist, supplemental 
targets), as appropriate, for reducing improper payments associated with 
each high-priority program;

(iii) issue Government-wide guidance on the implementation of this order, 
including procedures for identifying and publicizing the list of entities 
described in subsection (b)(v) of this section and for administrative 
appeal of the decision to publish the identity of those entities, prior to 
publication; and

(iv) establish a working group consisting of Federal, State, and local 
officials to make recommendations to the Director of OMB designed to 
improve the Federal Government's measurement of access to Federal programs 
by the programs' intended beneficiaries. The working group's 
recommendations shall be prepared in consultation with the Council of 
Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) and submitted within 
180 days of the date of this order, and the recommended measurements may be 
incorporated by the Secretary of the Treasury in the information published 
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the 
Treasury in coordination with the Attorney General and the Director of 
OMB, shall publish on the Internet information about improper payments 
under high-priority programs. The information shall include, subject to 
Federal privacy policies and to the extent permitted by law:

(i) the names of the accountable officials designated under section 3 of 
this order;

(ii) current and historical rates and amounts of improper payments, 
including, where known and appropriate, causes of the improper payments;

(iii) current and historical rates and amounts of recovery of improper 
payments, where appropriate (or, where improper payments are identified 
solely on the basis of a sample, recovery rates and amounts estimated on 
the basis of the applicable sample);

(iv) targets for reducing as well as recovering improper payments, where 
appropriate; and

(v) the entities that have received the greatest amount of outstanding 
improper payments (or, where improper payments are identified solely on the 
basis of a sample, the entities that have received the greatest amount of 
outstanding improper payments in the applicable sample).

Information on entities that have received the greatest amount of 
outstanding improper payments shall not include any referrals the agency 
made or anticipates making to the Department of Justice, or any 
information provided in connection with such referrals.
(c) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the 
Treasury in coordination with the Attorney General and the Director of 
OMB and in consultation with the CIGIE, shall establish a central 
Internet-based method to collect from the public information concerning 
suspected incidents of waste, fraud, and abuse by an entity receiving 
Federal funds that have led or may lead to improper payments by the 
Federal Government.
(d) Agencies shall place a prominently displayed link to Internet-based 
resources for addressing improper payments, including the resources 
established under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, on their 
Internet home pages.
Sec. 3. Agency Accountability and Coordination.
(a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the head of each agency 
responsible for operating a high-priority program shall designate an 
official who holds an existing Senate-confirmed position to be 
accountable for meeting the targets established under section 2 of this 
order without unduly burdening program access and participation by 
eligible beneficiaries. In those agencies where the majority of payments 
are isolated to a single component, the head of the agency shall name a 
second accountable official for that component whose sole responsibility 
would be for program integrity activities and, as appropriate, shall 
consolidate and coordinate all program integrity activities within the 
component.
(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, each agency official 
designated under subsection (a) of this section, or otherwise designated 
by the Director of OMB, shall provide the agency's Inspector General a 
report containing:

(i) the agency's methodology for identifying and measuring improper 
payments by the agency's high-priority programs;

(ii) the agency's plans, together with supporting analysis, for meeting the 
reduction targets for improper payments in the agency's high-priority 
programs; and

(iii) the agency's plan, together with supporting analysis, for ensuring 
that initiatives undertaken pursuant to this order do not unduly burden 
program access and participation by eligible beneficiaries.

Following the receipt and review of this information, the agency 
Inspector General shall assess the level of risk associated with the 
applicable programs, determine the extent of oversight warranted, and 
provide the agency head with recommendations, if any, for modifying the 
agency's methodology, improper payment reduction plans, or program 
access and participation plans.
(c) If an agency fails to meet the targets established under section 2 
of this order or implement the plan described in subsection (b)(iii) of 
this section for 2 consecutive years, that agency's accountable official 
designated under subsection (a) of this section shall submit to the 
agency head, Inspector General, and Chief Financial Officer a report 
describing the likely causes of the agency's failure and proposing a 
remedial plan. The agency head shall review this plan and, in 
consultation with the Inspector General and Chief Financial Officer, 
forward the plan with any additional comments and analysis to the 
Director of OMB.
(d) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Chief Financial 
Officers Council (CFOC) in consultation with the CIGIE, the Department 
of Justice, and program experts, shall make recommendations to the 
Director of OMB and the Secretary of the Treasury on actions (including 
actions related to forensic accounting and audits) agencies should take 
to more effectively tailor their methodologies for identifying and 
measuring improper payments to those programs, or components of 
programs, where improper payments are most likely to occur. 
Recommendations shall address the manner in which the recommended 
actions would affect program access and participation by eligible 
beneficiaries.
(e) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the 
Treasury and the Director of OMB in consultation with the CIGIE, the 
Department of Justice, and program experts, shall recommend to the 
President actions designed to reduce improper payments by improving 
information sharing among agencies and programs, and where applicable, 
State and local governments and other stakeholders. The recommendations 
shall address the ways in which information sharing may improve 
eligibility verification and pre-payment scrutiny, shall identify legal 
or regulatory impediments to effective information sharing, and shall 
address the manner in which the recommended actions would affect program 
access and participation by eligible beneficiaries.
(f) Within 180 days of the date of this order, and at least once every 
quarter thereafter, the head of each agency shall submit to the agency's 
Inspector General and the CIGIE, and make available to the public, a 
report on any high-dollar improper payments identified by the agency, 
subject to Federal privacy policies and to the extent permitted by law. 
The report shall describe any actions the agency has taken or plans to 
take to recover improper payments, as well as any actions the agency 
intends to take to prevent improper payments from occurring in the 
future. The report shall not include any referrals the agency made or 
anticipates making to the Department of Justice, or any information 
provided in connection with such referrals. Following the review of each 
report, the agency Inspector General and the CIGIE shall assess the 
level of risk associated with the applicable program, determine the 
extent of oversight warranted, and provide the agency head with 
recommendations, if any, for modifying the agency's plans.
Sec. 4. Enhanced Focus on Contractors and Working with State and Local 
Stakeholders.
(a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Federal Acquisition 
Regulatory Council, in coordination with the Director of OMB, and in 
consultation with the National Procurement Fraud Task Force (or its 
successor group), the CIGIE, and appropriate agency officials, shall 
recommend to the President actions designed to enhance contractor 
accountability for improper payments. The recommendations may include, 
but are not limited to, subjecting contractors to debarment, suspension, 
financial penalties, and identification through a public Internet 
website, subject to Federal privacy policies and to the extent permitted 
by law and where the identification would not interfere with or 
compromise an ongoing criminal or civil investigation, for knowingly 
failing timely to disclose credible evidence of significant overpayments 
received on Government contracts.
(b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB shall 
establish a working group consisting of Federal and elected State and 
local officials to make recommendations to the Director of OMB designed 
to improve the effectiveness of single audits of State and local 
governments and non-profit organizations that are expending Federal 
funds. The Director of OMB may designate an appropriate official to 
serve as Chair of the working group to convene its meetings and direct 
its work. The working group's recommendations shall be prepared in 
consultation with the CIGIE and submitted within 180 days of the date of 
this order. The recommendations shall address, among other things, the 
effectiveness of single audits in identifying improper payments and 
opportunities to streamline or eliminate single audit requirements where 
their value is minimal.
(c) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Director of OMB shall 
establish a working group (which may be separate from the group 
established under subsection (b) of this section) consisting of Federal 
and elected State and local officials to make recommendations to the 
Director of OMB for administrative actions designed to improve the 
incentives and accountability of State and local governments, as well as 
other entities receiving Federal funds, for reducing improper payments. 
The Director of OMB may designate an appropriate official to serve as 
Chair of the working group to convene its meetings and direct its work. 
The working group's recommendations shall be prepared in consultation 
with the CIGIE and submitted within 180 days of the date of this order.
Sec. 5. Policy Proposals. The Director of OMB, in consultation with the 
appropriate agencies and the CIGIE, shall develop policy 
recommendations, including potential legislative proposals, designed to 
reduce improper payments, including those caused by error, waste, fraud, 
and abuse, across Federal programs without compromising program access, 
to be included, as appropriate, in the Budget of the United States 
Government for Fiscal Year 2011 and future years, or other 
Administration proposals.
Sec. 6. General Provisions.
(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) authority granted by law to a department, agency, the head thereof, or 
any agency Inspector General; or

(ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to require the disclosure 
of classified information, law enforcement sensitive information, or 
other information that must be protected in the interests of national 
security.
(c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations.
(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13522 of December 9, 2009

Creating Labor-Management Forums To Improve Delivery of Government 
Services

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish a 
cooperative and productive form of labor-management relations throughout 
the executive branch, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Federal employees and their union representatives are 
an essential source of front-line ideas and information about the 
realities of delivering Government services to the American people. A 
nonadversarial forum for managers, employees, and employees' union 
representatives to discuss Government operations will promote 
satisfactory labor relations and improve the productivity and 
effectiveness of the Federal Government. Labor-management forums, as 
complements to the existing collective bargaining process, will allow 
managers and employees to collaborate in continuing to deliver the 
highest quality services to the American people. Management should 
discuss workplace challenges and problems with labor and endeavor to 
develop solutions jointly, rather than advise union representatives of 
predetermined solutions to problems and then engage in bargaining over 
the impact and implementation of the predetermined solutions.
    The purpose of this order is to establish a cooperative and 
productive form of labor-management relations throughout the executive 
branch.
Sec. 2. The National Council on Federal Labor-Management Relations. 
There is established the National Council on Federal Labor-Management 
Relations (Council).
    (a) Membership. The Council shall be composed of the following 
members appointed or designated by the President:
    (i) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
and Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB), who shall serve as Co-Chairs of the Council;
    (ii) the Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority;
    (iii) a Deputy Secretary or other officer with department- or 
agency-wide authority from each of five executive departments or 
agencies not otherwise represented on the Council, who shall serve 
for terms of 2 years;
    (iv) the President of the American Federation of Government 
Employees, AFL-CIO;
    (v) the President of the National Federation of Federal 
Employees;
    (vi) the President of the National Treasury Employees Union;
    (vii) the President of the International Federation of 
Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO;
    (viii) the heads of three other labor unions that represent 
Federal employees and are not otherwise represented on the 
Council, who shall serve for terms of 2 years;
    (ix) the President of the Senior Executives Association; and
    (x) the President of the Federal Managers Association.
    (b) Responsibilities and Functions. The Council shall advise the 
President on matters involving labor-management relations in the 
executive branch. Its activities shall include, to the extent permitted 
by law:
    (i) supporting the creation of department- or agency-level 
labor-management forums and promoting partnership efforts between 
labor and management in the executive branch;
    (ii) developing suggested measurements and metrics for the 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Council and department or 
agency labor-management forums in order to promote consistent, 
appropriate, and administratively efficient measurement and 
evaluation processes across departments and agencies;
    (iii) collecting and disseminating information about, and 
providing guidance on, labor-management relations improvement 
efforts in the executive branch, including results achieved;
    (iv) utilizing the expertise of individuals both within and 
outside the Federal Government to foster successful labor-
management relations, including through training of department and 
agency personnel in methods of dispute resolution and cooperative 
methods of labor-management relations;
    (v) developing recommendations for innovative ways to improve 
delivery of services and products to the public while cutting 
costs and advancing employee interests;
    (vi) serving as a venue for addressing systemic failures of 
department- or agency-level forums established pursuant to section 
3 of this order; and
    (vii) providing recommendations to the President for the 
implementation of several pilot programs within the executive 
branch, described in section 4 of this order, for bargaining over 
subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(1).
    (c) Administration.
    (i) The Co-Chairs shall convene and preside at meetings of the 
Council, determine its agenda, and direct its work.
    (ii) The Council shall seek input from nonmember executive 
departments and agencies, particularly smaller agencies. It also 
may, from time to time, invite persons from the private and public 
sectors to submit information. The Council shall also seek input 
from Federal manager and professional associations, companies, 
nonprofit organizations, State and local governments, Federal 
employees, and customers of Federal services, as needed.
    (iii) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the 
availability of appropriations, OPM shall provide such facilities, 
support, and administrative services to the Council as the 
Director of OPM deems appropriate.
    (iv) Members of the Council shall serve without compensation 
for their work on the Council, but may be allowed travel expenses, 
including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law 
for persons serving intermittently in Government service (5 U.S.C. 
5701-5707), consistent with the availability of funds.
    (v) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to 
the extent permitted by law, provide to the Council such 
assistance, information, and advice as the Council may require for 
purposes of carrying out its functions.
    (vi) Insofar as the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended 
(5 U.S.C. App.), may apply to the Council, any functions of the 
President under that Act, except that of reporting to the 
Congress, shall be performed by the Director of OPM in accordance 
with the guidelines that have been issued by the Administrator of 
General Services.
    (d) Termination. The Council shall terminate 2 years after the date 
of this order unless extended by the President.
Sec. 3. Implementation of Labor-Management Forums Throughout the 
Executive Branch. 
     (a) The head of each executive department or agency that is subject 
to the provisions of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act 
(5 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), or any other authority permitting employees of 
such department or agency to select an exclusive representative shall, 
to the extent permitted by law:
    (i) establish department- or agency-level labor-management 
forums by creating labor-management committees or councils at the 
levels of recognition and other appropriate levels agreed to by 
labor and management, or adapting existing councils or committees 
if such groups exist, to help identify problems and propose 
solutions to better serve the public and agency missions;
    (ii) allow employees and their union representatives to have 
pre-decisional involvement in all workplace matters to the fullest 
extent practicable, without regard to whether those matters are 
negotiable subjects of bargaining under 5 U.S.C. 7106; provide 
adequate information on such matters expeditiously to union 
representatives where not prohibited by law; and make a good-faith 
attempt to resolve issues concerning proposed changes in 
conditions of employment, including those involving the subjects 
set forth in 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(1), through discussions in its 
labor-management forums; and
    (iii) evaluate and document, in consultation with union 
representatives and consistent with the purposes of this order and 
any further guidance provided by the Council, changes in employee 
satisfaction, manager satisfaction, and organizational performance 
resulting from the labor-management forums.
    (b) Each head of an executive department or agency in which there 
exists one or more exclusive representatives shall, in consultation with 
union representatives, prepare and submit for approval, within 90 days 
of the date of this order, a written implementation plan to the Council. 
The plan shall:
    (i) describe how the department or agency will conduct a 
baseline assessment of the current state of labor relations within 
the department or agency;
    (ii) report the extent to which the department or agency has 
established labor-management forums, as set forth in subsection 
(a)(i) of this section, or may participate in the pilot projects 
described in section 4 of this order;
    (iii) address how the department or agency will work with the 
exclusive representatives of its employees through its labor-
management forums to develop department-, agency-, or bargaining 
unit-specific metrics to monitor improvements in areas such as 
labor-management satisfaction, productivity gains, cost savings, 
and other areas as identified by the relevant labor-management 
forum's participants; and
    (iv) explain the department's or agency's plan for devoting 
sufficient resources to the implementation of the plan.
    (c) The Council shall review each executive department or agency 
implementation plan within 30 days of receipt and provide a 
recommendation to the Co-Chairs as to whether to certify that the plan 
satisfies all requirements of this order. Plans that are determined by 
the Co-Chairs to be insufficient will be returned to the department or 
agency with guidance for improvement and resubmission within 30 days. 
Each department or agency covered by subsection (b) of this section must 
have a certified implementation plan in place no later than 150 days 
after the date of this order, unless the Co-Chairs of the Council 
authorize an extension of the deadline.
Sec. 4. Negotiation over Permissive Subjects of Bargaining.
    (a) In order to evaluate the impact of bargaining over permissive 
subjects, several pilot projects of specified duration shall be 
established in which some executive departments or agencies elect to 
bargain over some or all of the subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. 
7106(b)(1) and waive any objection to participating in impasse 
procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 7119 that is based on the subjects 
being permissive. The Council shall develop recommendations for 
establishing the pilot projects, including (i) recommendations for 
evaluating such pilot projects on the basis, among other things, of 
their impacts on organizational performance, employee satisfaction, and 
labor relations of the affected departments or agencies; (ii) 
recommended methods for evaluating the effectiveness of dispute 
resolution procedures adopted and followed in the course of the pilot 
projects; and (iii) a recommended timeline for expeditious 
implementation of the pilot programs.
    (b) The Council shall present its recommendations to the President 
within 150 days after the date of this order.
    (c) No later than 18 months after implementation of the pilot 
projects, the Council shall submit a report to the President evaluating 
the results of the pilots and recommending appropriate next steps with 
respect to agency bargaining over the subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. 
7106(b)(1).
Sec. 5. General Provisions.
    (a) Nothing in this order shall abrogate any collective bargaining 
agreements in effect on the date of this order.
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit, preclude, or 
prohibit any head of an executive department or agency from electing to 
negotiate over any or all of the subjects set forth in 5 U.S.C. 
7106(b)(1) in any negotiation.
    (c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:
    (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, 
agency, or the head thereof; or
    (ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.
    (d) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (e) This order is intended only to improve the internal management 
of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any

benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13526 of December 29, 2009

Classified National Security Information

This order prescribes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, 
and declassifying national security information, including information 
relating to defense against transnational terrorism. Our democratic 
principles require that the American people be informed of the 
activities of their Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on 
the free flow of information both within the Government and to the 
American people. Nevertheless, throughout our history, the national 
defense has required that certain information be maintained in 
confidence in order to protect our citizens, our democratic 
institutions, our homeland security, and our interactions with foreign 
nations. Protecting information critical to our Nation's security and 
demonstrating our commitment to open Government through accurate and 
accountable application of classification standards and routine, secure, 
and effective declassification are equally important priorities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the authority vested in me as 
President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
PART 1--ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION
Section 1.1. Classification Standards. (a) Information may be originally 
classified under the terms of this order only if all of the following 
conditions are met:

(1) an original classification authority is classifying the information;

(2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the 
control of the United States Government;

(3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of 
information listed in section 1.4 of this order; and

(4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized 
disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in 
damage to the national security, which includes defense against 
transnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able 
to identify or describe the damage.

    (b) If there is significant doubt about the need to classify 
information, it shall not be classified. This provision does not:

(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for 
classification; or

(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.

    (c) Classified information shall not be declassified automatically 
as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar 
information.
    (d) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is 
presumed to cause damage to the national security.
Sec. 1.2. Classification Levels. (a) Information may be classified at 
one of the following three levels:

(1) ``Top Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally 
grave damage to the national security that the original classification 
authority is able to identify or describe.

(2) ``Secret'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure 
of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the 
national security that the original classification authority is able to 
identify or describe.

(3) ``Confidential'' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized 
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the 
national security that the original classification authority is able to 
identify or describe.

    (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be 
used to identify United States classified information.
    (c) If there is significant doubt about the appropriate level of 
classification, it shall be classified at the lower level.
Sec. 1.3. Classification Authority. (a) The authority to classify 
information originally may be exercised only by:

(1) the President and the Vice President;

(2) agency heads and officials designated by the President; and

(3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section.

    (b) Officials authorized to classify information at a specified 
level are also authorized to classify information at a lower level.
    (c) Delegation of original classification authority.

(1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to 
the minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible 
for ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and 
continuing need to exercise this authority.

(2) ``Top Secret'' original classification authority may be delegated only 
by the President, the Vice President, or an agency head or official 
designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(3) ``Secret'' or ``Confidential'' original classification authority may be 
delegated only by the President, the Vice President, an agency head or 
official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the 
senior agency official designated under section 5.4(d) of this order, 
provided that official has been delegated ``Top Secret'' original 
classification authority by the agency head.

(4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in 
writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in 
this order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or 
position.

(5) Delegations of original classification authority shall be reported or 
made available by name or position to the Director of the Information 
Security Oversight Office.

    (d) All original classification authorities must receive training in 
proper classification (including the avoidance of over-classification) 
and declassification as provided in this order and its implementing 
directives at least once a calendar year. Such training must include 
instruction on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on 
the sanctions in section 5.5 of this order that may be brought against 
an individual who fails to classify information properly or protect 
classified information from unauthorized disclosure. Original 
classification authorities who do not receive such mandatory training at 
least once within a calendar year shall have their classification 
authority suspended by the agency head or the senior agency official 
designated under section 5.4(d) of this order until such training has 
taken place. A waiver may be granted by the agency head, the deputy 
agency head, or the senior agency official if an individual is unable to 
receive such training due to unavoidable circumstances. Whenever a 
waiver is granted, the individual shall receive such training as soon as 
practicable.
    (e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government contractor, 
licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an agency who does not have 
original classification authority originates information believed by 
that person to require classification, the information shall be 
protected in a manner consistent with this order and its implementing 
directives. The information shall be transmitted promptly as provided 
under this order or its implementing directives to the agency that has 
appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority with 
respect to this information. That agency shall decide within 30 days 
whether to classify this information.
Sec. 1.4. Classification Categories. Information shall not be considered 
for classification unless its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably 
be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national 
security in accordance with section 1.2 of this order, and it pertains 
to one or more of the following:
    (a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations;
    (b) foreign government information;
    (c) intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence 
sources or methods, or cryptology;
    (d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, 
including confidential sources;
    (e) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the 
national security;
    (f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear 
materials or facilities;
    (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, 
infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the 
national security; or (h) the development, production, or use of weapons 
of mass destruction.
Sec. 1.5. Duration of Classification. (a) At the time of original 
classification, the original classification authority shall establish a 
specific date or event for declassification based on the duration of the 
national security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date 
or event, the information shall be automatically declassified. Except 
for information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to 
reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human 
intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass 
destruction, the date or event shall not exceed the time frame 
established in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an 
earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall 
be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original 
decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise 
determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be 
marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the 
original decision.
    (c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of 
classification up to 25 years from the date of origin of the document, 
change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information 
only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under 
this order are followed.
    (d) No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information 
marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor 
orders, for example, marked as ``Originating Agency's Determination 
Required,'' or classified information that contains incomplete 
declassification instructions or lacks declassification instructions 
shall be declassified in accordance with part 3 of this order.
Sec. 1.6. Identification and Markings. (a) At the time of original 
classification, the following shall be indicated in a manner that is 
immediately apparent:

(1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2 of this 
order;

(2) the identity, by name and position, or by personal identifier, of the 
original classification authority;

(3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident;

(4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of the 
following:

  (A) the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in section 
1.5(a);

  (B) the date that is 10 years from the date of original classification, 
as prescribed in section 1.5(b);

  (C) the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original 
classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); or

  (D) in the case of information that should clearly and demonstrably be 
expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human 
intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, 
the marking prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this 
order; and

(5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the 
applicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this order.

    (b) Specific information required in paragraph (a) of this section 
may be excluded if it would reveal additional classified information.
    (c) With respect to each classified document, the agency originating 
the document shall, by marking or other means, indicate which portions 
are classified, with the applicable classification level, and which 
portions are unclassified. In accordance with standards prescribed in 
directives issued under this order, the Director of the Information 
Security Oversight Office may grant and revoke temporary waivers of this 
requirement. The Director shall revoke any waiver upon a finding of 
abuse.
    (d) Markings or other indicia implementing the provisions of this 
order, including abbreviations and requirements to safeguard classified 
working papers, shall conform to the standards prescribed in 
implementing directives issued pursuant to this order.
    (e) Foreign government information shall retain its original 
classification markings or shall be assigned a U.S. classification that 
provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by 
the entity that furnished the information. Foreign government 
information retaining its original classification markings need not be 
assigned a U.S. classification marking provided that the responsible 
agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to 
meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings.
    (f) Information assigned a level of classification under this or 
predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of 
classification despite the omission of other required markings. Whenever 
such information is used in the derivative classification process or is 
reviewed for possible declassification, holders of such information 
shall coordinate with an appropriate classification authority for the 
application of omitted markings.
    (g) The classification authority shall, whenever practicable, use a 
classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small 
portion of an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product to 
allow for dissemination at the lowest level of classification possible 
or in unclassified form.
    (h) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be 
appropriately marked to reflect their declassification.
Sec. 1.7. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations. (a) In no case 
shall information be classified, continue to be maintained as 
classified, or fail to be declassified in order to:

(1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error;

(2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency;

(3) restrain competition; or

(4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require 
protection in the interest of the national security.

    (b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the 
national security shall not be classified.
    (c) Information may not be reclassified after declassification and 
release to the public under proper authority unless:

(1) the reclassification is personally approved in writing by the agency 
head based on a document-by-document determination by the agency that 
reclassification is required to prevent significant and demonstrable damage 
to the national security;

(2) the information may be reasonably recovered without bringing undue 
attention to the information;

(3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Assistant to 
the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and 
the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office; and

(4) for documents in the physical and legal custody of the National 
Archives and Records Administration (National Archives) that have been 
available for public use, the agency head has, after making the 
determinations required by this paragraph, notified the Archivist of the 
United States (Archivist), who shall suspend public access pending approval 
of the reclassification action by the Director of the Information Security 
Oversight Office. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed by the 
agency head to the President through the National Security Advisor. Public 
access shall remain suspended pending a prompt decision on the appeal.

    (d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public 
under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency 
has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 
U.S.C. 552), the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2204(c)(1), the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions 
of section 3.5 of this order only if such classification meets the 
requirements of this order and is accomplished on a document-by-document 
basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the 
agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official 
designated under section 5.4 of this order. The requirements in this 
paragraph also apply to those situations in which information has been 
declassified in accordance with a specific date or event determined by 
an original classification authority in accordance with section 1.5 of 
this order.
    (e) Compilations of items of information that are individually 
unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an 
additional association or relationship that:

(1) meets the standards for classification under this order; and

(2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information.

Sec. 1.8. Classification Challenges. (a) Authorized holders of 
information who, in good faith, believe that its classification status 
is improper are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification 
status of the information in accordance with agency procedures 
established under paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) In accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant to 
this order, an agency head or senior agency official shall establish 
procedures under which authorized holders of information, including 
authorized holders outside the classifying agency, are encouraged and 
expected to challenge the classification of information that they 
believe is improperly classified or unclassified. These procedures shall 
ensure that:

(1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions;

(2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial official or 
panel; and

(3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency decisions to 
the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) established 
by section 5.3 of this order.

    (c) Documents required to be submitted for prepublication review or 
other administrative process pursuant to an approved nondisclosure 
agreement are not covered by this section.
Sec. 1.9. Fundamental Classification Guidance Review. (a) Agency heads 
shall complete on a periodic basis a comprehensive review of the 
agency's classification guidance, particularly classification guides, to 
ensure the guidance reflects current circumstances and to identify 
classified information that no longer requires protection and can be 
declassified. The initial fundamental classification guidance review 
shall be completed within 2 years of the effective date of this order.
    (b) The classification guidance review shall include an evaluation 
of classified information to determine if it meets the standards for 
classification under section 1.4 of this order, taking into account an 
up-to-date assessment of likely damage as described under section 1.2 of 
this order.
    (c) The classification guidance review shall include original 
classification authorities and agency subject matter experts to ensure a 
broad range of perspectives.
    (d) Agency heads shall provide a report summarizing the results of 
the classification guidance review to the Director of the Information 
Security Oversight Office and shall release an unclassified version of 
this report to the public.
PART 2--DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION
Sec. 2.1. Use of Derivative Classification. (a) Persons who reproduce, 
extract, or summarize classified information, or who apply 
classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a 
classification guide, need not possess original classification 
authority.
    (b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall:

(1) be identified by name and position, or by personal identifier, in a 
manner that is immediately apparent for each derivative classification 
action;

(2) observe and respect original classification decisions; and

(3) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent 
classification markings. For information derivatively classified based on 
multiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward:

  (A) the date or event for declassification that corresponds to the 
longest period of classification among the sources, or the marking 
established pursuant to section 1.6(a)(4)(D) of this order; and

  (B) a listing of the source materials.

    (c) Derivative classifiers shall, whenever practicable, use a 
classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small 
portion of an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product to 
allow for dissemination at the lowest level of classification possible 
or in unclassified form.
    (d) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall 
receive training in the proper application of the derivative 
classification principles of the order, with an emphasis on avoiding 
over-classification, at least once every 2 years. Derivative classifiers 
who do not receive such training at least once every 2 years shall have 
their authority to apply derivative classification markings suspended 
until they have received such training. A waiver may be granted by the 
agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official if an 
individual is unable to receive such training due to unavoidable 
circumstances. Whenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall 
receive such training as soon as practicable.
Sec. 2.2. Classification Guides. (a) Agencies with original 
classification authority shall prepare classification guides to 
facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification of 
information. These guides shall conform to standards contained in 
directives issued under this order.
    (b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in writing by an 
official who:

(1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is 
the senior agency official; and

(2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level 
of classification prescribed in the guide.

    (c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure that 
classification guides are reviewed and updated as provided in directives 
issued under this order.
    (d) Agencies shall incorporate original classification decisions 
into classification guides on a timely basis and in accordance with 
directives issued under this order.
    (e) Agencies may incorporate exemptions from automatic 
declassification approved pursuant to section 3.3(j) of this order into 
classification guides, provided that the Panel is notified of the intent 
to take such action for specific information in advance of approval and 
the information remains in active use.
    (f) The duration of classification of a document classified by a 
derivative classifier using a classification guide shall not exceed 25 
years from the date of the origin of the document, except for:

(1) information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal 
the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source 
or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction; and

(2) specific information incorporated into classification guides in 
accordance with section 2.2(e) of this order.

PART 3--DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING
Sec. 3.1. Authority for Declassification. (a) Information shall be 
declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for 
classification under this order.
    (b) Information shall be declassified or downgraded by:

(1) the official who authorized the original classification, if that 
official is still serving in the same position and has original 
classification authority;

(2) the originator's current successor in function, if that individual has 
original classification authority;

(3) a supervisory official of either the originator or his or her successor 
in function, if the supervisory official has original classification 
authority; or (4) officials delegated declassification authority in writing 
by the agency head or the senior agency official of the originating agency.

    (c) The Director of National Intelligence (or, if delegated by the 
Director of National Intelligence, the Principal Deputy Director of 
National Intelligence) may, with respect to the Intelligence Community, 
after consultation with the head of the originating Intelligence 
Community element or department, declassify, downgrade, or direct the 
declassification or downgrading of information or intelligence relating 
to intelligence sources, methods, or activities.
    (d) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the 
classification requirements under this order requires continued 
protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such 
information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of 
the information, and in these cases the information should be 
declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be referred to the 
agency head or the senior agency official. That official will determine, 
as an exercise of discretion, whether the public interest in disclosure 
outweighs the damage to the national security that might reasonably be 
expected from disclosure. This provision does not:

(1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for 
classification; or

(2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review.

    (e) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office 
determines that information is classified in violation of this order, 
the Director may require the information to be declassified by the 
agency that originated the classification. Any such decision by the 
Director may be appealed to the President through the National Security 
Advisor. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt 
decision on the appeal.
    (f) The provisions of this section shall also apply to agencies 
that, under the terms of this order, do not have original classification 
authority, but had such authority under predecessor orders.
    (g) No information may be excluded from declassification under 
section 3.3 of this order based solely on the type of document or record 
in which it is found. Rather, the classified information must be 
considered on the basis of its content.
    (h) Classified nonrecord materials, including artifacts, shall be 
declassified as soon as they no longer meet the standards for 
classification under this order.
    (i) When making decisions under sections 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of this 
order, agencies shall consider the final decisions of the Panel.
Sec. 3.2. Transferred Records.
    (a) In the case of classified records transferred in conjunction 
with a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage purposes, the 
receiving agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency for 
purposes of this order.
    (b) In the case of classified records that are not officially 
transferred as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but that 
originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for which there is 
no successor agency, each agency in possession of such records shall be 
deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order. Such 
records may be declassified or downgraded by the agency in possession of 
the records after consultation with any other agency that has an 
interest in the subject matter of the records.
    (c) Classified records accessioned into the National Archives shall 
be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist in accordance with this 
order, the directives issued pursuant to this order, agency 
declassification guides, and any existing procedural agreement between 
the Archivist and the relevant agency head.
    (d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to 
declassify classified information contained in records determined to 
have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into the 
National Archives. However, the Archivist may require that classified 
records be accessioned into the National Archives when necessary to 
comply with the provisions of the Federal Records Act. This provision 
does not apply to records transferred to the Archivist pursuant to 
section 2203 of title 44, United States Code, or records for which the 
National Archives serves as the custodian of the records of an agency or 
organization that has gone out of existence.
    (e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt a system of 
records management that will facilitate the public release of documents 
at the time such documents are declassified pursuant to the provisions 
for automatic declassification in section 3.3 of this order.
Sec. 3.3 Automatic Declassification.
    (a) Subject to paragraphs (b)-(d) and (g)-(j) of this section, all 
classified records that (1) are more than 25 years old and (2) have been 
determined to have permanent historical value under title 44, United 
States Code, shall be automatically declassified whether or not the 
records have been reviewed. All classified records shall be 
automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years 
from the date of origin, except as provided in paragraphs (b)-(d) and 
(g)-(j) of this section. If the date of origin of an individual record 
cannot be readily determined, the date of original classification shall 
be used instead.
    (b) An agency head may exempt from automatic declassification under 
paragraph (a) of this section specific information, the release of which 
should clearly and demonstrably be expected to:

(1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, a human 
intelligence source, a relationship with an intelligence or security 
service of a foreign government or international organization, or a 
nonhuman intelligence source; or impair the effectiveness of an 
intelligence method currently in use, available for use, or under 
development;

(2) reveal information that would assist in the development, production, or 
use of weapons of mass destruction;

(3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or 
activities;

(4) reveal information that would impair the application of state-of-the-
art technology within a U.S. weapon system;

(5) reveal formally named or numbered U.S. military war plans that remain 
in effect, or reveal operational or tactical elements of prior plans that 
are contained in such active plans;

(6) reveal information, including foreign government information, that 
would cause serious harm to relations between the United States and a 
foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the United 
States;

(7) reveal information that would impair the current ability of United 
States Government officials to protect the President, Vice President, and 
other protectees for whom protection services, in the interest of the 
national security, are authorized;

(8) reveal information that would seriously impair current national 
security emergency preparedness plans or reveal current vulnerabilities of 
systems, installations, or infrastructures relating to the national 
security; or

(9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement that does not 
permit the automatic or unilateral declassification of information at 25 
years.

    (c)(1) An agency head shall notify the Panel of any specific file 
series of records for which a review or assessment has determined that 
the information within that file series almost invariably falls within 
one or more of the exemption categories listed in paragraph (b) of this 
section and that the agency proposes to exempt from automatic 
declassification at 25 years.

(2) The notification shall include:

  (A) a description of the file series;

  (B) an explanation of why the information within the file series is 
almost invariably exempt from automatic declassification and why the 
information must remain classified for a longer period of time; and

  (C) except when the information within the file series almost invariably 
identifies a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or 
key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, a specific date or 
event for declassification of the information, not to exceed December 31 of 
the year that is 50 years from the date of origin of the records.

(3) The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt a designated file series 
or to declassify the information within that series at an earlier date than 
recommended. The agency head may appeal such a decision to the President 
through the National Security Advisor.

(4) File series exemptions approved by the President prior to December 31, 
2008, shall remain valid without any additional agency action pending Panel 
review by the later of December 31, 2010, or December 31 of the year that 
is 10 years from the date of previous approval.

    (d) The following provisions shall apply to the onset of automatic 
declassification:

(1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined in this 
order, that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under this 
section shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the 
year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the 
file block.

(2) After consultation with the Director of the National Declassification 
Center (the Center) established by section 3.7 of this order and before the 
records are subject to automatic declassification, an agency head or senior 
agency official may delay automatic declassification for up to five 
additional years for classified information contained in media that make a 
review for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly.

(3) Other than for records that are properly exempted from automatic 
declassification, records containing classified information that originated 
with other agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests 
or activities of other agencies with respect to the classified information 
and could reasonably be expected to fall under one or more of the 
exemptions in paragraph (b) of this section shall be identified prior to 
the onset of automatic declassification for later referral to those 
agencies.

  (A) The information of concern shall be referred by the Center 
established by section 3.7 of this order, or by the centralized facilities 
referred to in section 3.7(e) of this order, in a prioritized and scheduled 
manner determined by the Center.

  (B) If an agency fails to provide a final determination on a referral 
made by the Center within 1 year of referral, or by the centralized 
facilities referred to in section 3.7(e) of this order within 3 years of 
referral, its equities in the referred records shall be automatically 
declassified.

  (C) If any disagreement arises between affected agencies and the Center 
regarding the referral review period, the Director of the Information 
Security Oversight Office shall determine the appropriate period of review 
of referred records.

  (D) Referrals identified prior to the establishment of the Center by 
section 3.7 of this order shall be subject to automatic declassification 
only in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(3)(A)-(C) of this section.

(4) After consultation with the Director of the Information Security 
Oversight Office, an agency head may delay automatic declassification for 
up to 3 years from the date of discovery of classified records that were 
inadvertently not reviewed prior to the effective date of automatic 
declassification.

    (e) Information exempted from automatic declassification under this 
section shall remain subject to the mandatory and systematic 
declassification review provisions of this order.
    (f) The Secretary of State shall determine when the United States 
should commence negotiations with the appropriate officials of a foreign 
government or international organization of governments to modify any 
treaty or international agreement that requires the classification of 
information contained in records affected by this section for a period 
longer than 25 years from the date of its creation, unless the treaty or 
international agreement pertains to information that may otherwise 
remain classified beyond 25 years under this section.
    (g) The Secretary of Energy shall determine when information 
concerning foreign nuclear programs that was removed from the Restricted 
Data category in order to carry out provisions of the National Security 
Act of 1947, as amended, may be declassified. Unless otherwise 
determined, such information shall be declassified when comparable 
information concerning the United States nuclear program is 
declassified.
    (h) Not later than 3 years from the effective date of this order, 
all records exempted from automatic declassification under paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section shall be automatically declassified on 
December 31 of a year that is no more than 50 years from the date of 
origin, subject to the following:

(1) Records that contain information the release of which should clearly 
and demonstrably be expected to reveal the following are exempt from 
automatic declassification at 50 years:

  (A) the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence 
source; or

  (B) key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction.

(2) In extraordinary cases, agency heads may, within 5 years of the onset 
of automatic declassification, propose to exempt additional specific 
information from declassification at 50 years.

(3) Records exempted from automatic declassification under this paragraph 
shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of a year that is no 
more than 75 years from the date of origin unless an agency head, within 5 
years of that date, proposes to exempt specific information from 
declassification at 75 years and the proposal is formally approved by the 
Panel.

    (i) Specific records exempted from automatic declassification prior 
to the establishment of the Center described in section 3.7 of this 
order shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this 
section in a scheduled and prioritized manner determined by the Center.
    (j) At least 1 year before information is subject to automatic 
declassification under this section, an agency head or senior agency 
official shall notify the Director of the Information Security Oversight 
Office, serving as Executive Secretary of the Panel, of any specific 
information that the agency proposes to exempt from automatic 
declassification under paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section.

(1) The notification shall include:

  (A) a detailed description of the information, either by reference to 
information in specific records or in the form of a declassification guide;

  (B) an explanation of why the information should be exempt from automatic 
declassification and must remain classified for a longer period of time; 
and

  (C) a specific date or a specific and independently verifiable event for 
automatic declassification of specific records that contain the information 
proposed for exemption.

(2) The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt the information or to 
declassify it at an earlier date than recommended. An agency head may 
appeal such a decision to the President through the National Security 
Advisor. The information will remain classified while such an appeal is 
pending.

    (k) For information in a file series of records determined not to 
have permanent historical value, the duration of classification beyond 
25 years shall be the same as the disposition (destruction) date of 
those records in each Agency Records Control Schedule or General Records 
Schedule, although the duration of classification shall be extended if 
the record has been retained for business reasons beyond the scheduled 
disposition date.
Sec. 3.4. Systematic Declassification Review.
    (a) Each agency that has originated classified information under 
this order or its predecessors shall establish and conduct a program for 
systematic declassification review for records of permanent historical 
value exempted from automatic declassification under section 3.3 of this 
order. Agencies shall prioritize their review of such records in 
accordance with priorities established by the Center.
    (b) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic declassification review 
program for classified records:

(1) accessioned into the National Archives; (2) transferred to the 
Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2203; and (3) for which the National 
Archives serves as the custodian for an agency or organization that has 
gone out of existence.

Sec. 3.5. Mandatory Declassification Review.
    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all 
information classified under this order or predecessor orders shall be 
subject to a review for declassification by the originating agency if:

(1) the request for a review describes the document or material containing 
the information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to locate 
it with a reasonable amount of effort;

(2) the document or material containing the information responsive to the 
request is not contained within an operational file exempted from search 
and review, publication, and disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 in accordance 
with law; and

(3) the information is not the subject of pending litigation.

    (b) Information originated by the incumbent President or the 
incumbent Vice President; the incumbent President's White House Staff or 
the incumbent Vice President's Staff; committees, commissions, or boards 
appointed by the incumbent President; or other entities within the 
Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the 
incumbent President is exempted from the provisions of paragraph (a) of 
this section. However, the Archivist shall have the authority to review, 
downgrade, and declassify papers or records of former Presidents and 
Vice Presidents under the control of the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 
2107, 2111, 2111 note, or 2203. Review procedures developed by the 
Archivist shall provide for consultation with agencies having primary 
subject matter interest and shall be consistent with the provisions of 
applicable laws or lawful agreements that pertain to the respective 
Presidential papers or records. Agencies with primary subject matter 
interest shall be notified promptly of the Archivist's decision. Any 
final decision by the Archivist may be appealed by the requester or an 
agency to the Panel. The information shall remain classified pending a 
prompt decision on the appeal.
    (c) Agencies conducting a mandatory review for declassification 
shall declassify information that no longer meets the standards for 
classification under this order. They shall release this information 
unless withholding is otherwise authorized and warranted under 
applicable law.
    (d) If an agency has reviewed the requested information for 
declassification within the past 2 years, the agency need not conduct 
another review and may instead inform the requester of this fact and the 
prior review decision and advise the requester of appeal rights provided 
under subsection (e) of this section.
    (e) In accordance with directives issued pursuant to this order, 
agency heads shall develop procedures to process requests for the 
mandatory review of classified information. These procedures shall apply 
to information classified under this or predecessor orders. They also 
shall provide a means for administratively appealing a denial of a 
mandatory review request, and for notifying the requester of the right 
to appeal a final agency decision to the Panel.
    (f) After consultation with affected agencies, the Secretary of 
Defense shall develop special procedures for the review of cryptologic 
information; the Director of National Intelligence shall develop special 
procedures for the review of information pertaining to intelligence 
sources, methods, and activities; and the Archivist shall develop 
special procedures for the review of information accessioned into the 
National Archives.
    (g) Documents required to be submitted for prepublication review or 
other administrative process pursuant to an approved nondisclosure 
agreement are not covered by this section.
    (h) This section shall not apply to any request for a review made to 
an element of the Intelligence Community that is made by a person other 
than an individual as that term is defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(2), or by 
a foreign government entity or any representative thereof.
Sec. 3.6. Processing Requests and Reviews. Notwithstanding section 
4.1(i) of this order, in response to a request for information under the 
Freedom of Information Act, the Presidential Records Act, the Privacy 
Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of this order:
    (a) An agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or 
nonexistence of requested records whenever the fact of their existence 
or nonexistence is itself classified under this order or its 
predecessors.
    (b) When an agency receives any request for documents in its custody 
that contain classified information that originated with other agencies 
or the disclosure of which would affect the interests or activities of 
other agencies with respect to the classified information, or identifies 
such documents in the process of implementing sections 3.3 or 3.4 of 
this order, it shall refer copies of any request and the pertinent 
documents to the originating agency for processing and may, after 
consultation with the originating agency, inform any requester of the 
referral unless such association is itself classified under this order 
or its predecessors. In cases in which the originating agency determines 
in writing that a response under paragraph (a) of this section is 
required, the referring agency shall respond to the requester in 
accordance with that paragraph.
    (c) Agencies may extend the classification of information in records 
determined not to have permanent historical value or nonrecord 
materials, including artifacts, beyond the time frames established in 
sections 1.5(b) and 2.2(f) of this order, provided:

(1) the specific information has been approved pursuant to section 3.3(j) 
of this order for exemption from automatic declassification; and

(2) the extension does not exceed the date established in section 3.3(j) of 
this order.

Sec. 3.7. National Declassification Center. (a) There is established 
within the National Archives a National Declassification Center to 
streamline declassification processes, facilitate quality-assurance 
measures, and implement standardized training regarding the 
declassification of records determined to have permanent historical 
value. There shall be a Director of the Center who shall be appointed or 
removed by the Archivist in consultation with the Secretaries of State, 
Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the 
Director of National Intelligence.
    (b) Under the administration of the Director, the Center shall

that:

(1) a favorable determination of eligibility for access has been made by an 
agency head or the agency head's designee;

(2) the person has signed an approved nondisclosure agreement; and

(3) the person has a need-to-know the information.

    (b) Every person who has met the standards for access to classified 
information in paragraph (a) of this section shall receive 
contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of classified 
information and on the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions 
that may be imposed on an individual who fails to protect classified 
information from unauthorized disclosure.
    (c) An official or employee leaving agency service may not remove 
classified information from the agency's control or direct that 
information be declassified in order to remove it from agency control.
    (d) Classified information may not be removed from official premises 
without proper authorization.
    (e) Persons authorized to disseminate classified information outside 
the executive branch shall ensure the protection of the information in a 
manner equivalent to that provided within the executive branch.
    (f) Consistent with law, executive orders, directives, and 
regulations, an agency head or senior agency official or, with respect 
to the Intelligence Community, the Director of National Intelligence, 
shall establish uniform procedures to ensure that automated information 
systems, including networks and telecommunications systems, that 
collect, create, communicate, compute, disseminate, process, or store 
classified information:

(1) prevent access by unauthorized persons;

(2) ensure the integrity of the information; and

(3) to the maximum extent practicable, use:

  (A) common information technology standards, protocols, and interfaces 
that maximize the availability of, and access to, the information in a form 
and manner that facilitates its authorized use; and

  (B) standardized electronic formats to maximize the accessibility of 
information to persons who meet the criteria set forth in section 4.1(a) of 
this order.

    (g) Consistent with law, executive orders, directives, and 
regulations, each agency head or senior agency official, or with respect 
to the Intelligence Community, the Director of National Intelligence, 
shall establish controls to ensure that classified information is used, 
processed, stored, reproduced, transmitted, and destroyed under 
conditions that provide adequate protection and prevent access by 
unauthorized persons.
    (h) Consistent with directives issued pursuant to this order, an 
agency shall safeguard foreign government information under standards 
that provide a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required 
by the government or international organization of governments that 
furnished the information. When adequate to achieve equivalency, these 
standards may be less restrictive than the safeguarding standards that 
ordinarily apply to U.S. ``Confidential'' information, including 
modified handling and transmission and allowing access to individuals 
with a need-to-know who have not otherwise been cleared for access to 
classified information or executed an approved nondisclosure agreement.
    (i)(1) Classified information originating in one agency may be 
disseminated to another agency or U.S. entity by any agency to which it 
has been made available without the consent of the originating agency, 
as long as the criteria for access under section 4.1(a) of this order 
are met, unless the originating agency has determined that prior 
authorization is required for such dissemination and has marked or 
indicated such requirement on the medium containing the classified 
information in accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant 
to this order.

(2) Classified information originating in one agency may be disseminated by 
any other agency to which it has been made available to a foreign 
government in accordance with statute, this order, directives implementing 
this order, direction of the President, or with the consent of the 
originating agency. For the purposes of this section, ``foreign 
government'' includes any element of a foreign government, or an 
international organization of governments, or any element thereof.

(3) Documents created prior to the effective date of this order shall not 
be disseminated outside any other agency to which they have been made 
available without the consent of the originating agency. An agency head or 
senior agency official may waive this requirement for specific information 
that originated within that agency.

(4) For purposes of this section, the Department of Defense shall be 
considered one agency, except that any dissemination of information 
regarding intelligence sources, methods, or activities shall be consistent 
with directives issued pursuant tosection 6.2(b) of this order.

(5) Prior consent of the originating agency is not required when referring 
records for declassification review that contain information originating in 
more than one agency.

Sec. 4.2  Distribution Controls.
    (a) The head of each agency shall establish procedures in accordance 
with applicable law and consistent with directives issued pursuant to 
this order to ensure that classified information is accessible to the 
maximum extent possible by individuals who meet the criteria set forth 
in section 4.1(a) of this order.
    (b) In an emergency, when necessary to respond to an imminent threat 
to life or in defense of the homeland, the agency head or any designee 
may authorize the disclosure of classified information (including 
information marked pursuant to section 4.1(i)(1) of this order) to an 
individual or individuals who are otherwise not eligible for access. 
Such actions shall be taken only in accordance with directives 
implementing this order and any procedure issued by agencies governing 
the classified information, which shall be designed to minimize the 
classified information that is disclosed under these circumstances and 
the number of individuals who receive it. Information disclosed under 
this provision or implementing directives and procedures shall not be 
deemed declassified as a result of such disclosure or subsequent use by 
a recipient. Such disclosures shall be reported promptly to the 
originator of the classified information. For purposes of this section, 
the Director of National Intelligence may issue an implementing 
directive governing the emergency disclosure of classified intelligence 
information.
    (c) Each agency shall update, at least annually, the automatic, 
routine, or recurring distribution mechanism for classified information 
that it distributes. Recipients shall cooperate fully with distributors 
who are updating distribution lists and shall notify distributors 
whenever a relevant change in status occurs.
Sec. 4.3. Special Access Programs. (a) Establishment of special access 
programs. Unless otherwise authorized by the President, only the 
Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the 
Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, or the 
principal deputy of each, may create a special access program. For 
special access programs pertaining to intelligence sources, methods, and 
activities (but not including military operational, strategic, and 
tactical programs), this function shall be exercised by the Director of 
National Intelligence. These officials shall keep the number of these 
programs at an absolute minimum, and shall establish them only when the 
program is required by statute or upon a specific finding that:

(1) the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is 
exceptional; and

(2) the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access applicable 
to information classified at the same level are not deemed sufficient to 
protect the information from unauthorized disclosure.

    (b) Requirements and limitations.

(1) Special access programs shall be limited to programs in which the 
number of persons who ordinarily will have access will be reasonably small 
and commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for 
the information involved.

(2) Each agency head shall establish and maintain a system of accounting 
for special access programs consistent with directives issued pursuant to 
this order.

(3) Special access programs shall be subject to the oversight program 
established under section 5.4(d) of this order. In addition, the Director 
of the Information Security Oversight Office shall be afforded access to 
these programs, in accordance with the security requirements of each 
program, in order to perform the functions assigned to the Information 
Security Oversight Office under this order. An agency head may limit access 
to a special access program to the Director of the Information Security 
Oversight Office and no more than one other employee of the Information 
Security Oversight Office or, for special access programs that are 
extraordinarily sensitive and vulnerable, to the Director only.

(4) The agency head or principal deputy shall review annually each special 
access program to determine whether it continues to meet the requirements 
of this order.

(5) Upon request, an agency head shall brief the National Security Advisor, 
or a designee, on any or all of the agency's special access programs.

(6) For the purposes of this section, the term ``agency head'' refers only 
to the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the 
Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, or the 
principal deputy of each.

    (c) Nothing in this order shall supersede any requirement made by or 
under 10 U.S.C. 119.
Sec. 4.4. Access by Historical Researchers and Certain Former Government 
Personnel.
    (a) The requirement in section 4.1(a)(3) of this order that access 
to classified information may be granted only to individuals who have a 
need-to-know the information may be waived for persons who:

(1) are engaged in historical research projects;

(2) previously have occupied senior policy-making positions to which they 
were appointed or designated by the President or the Vice President; or

(3) served as President or Vice President.

    (b) Waivers under this section may be granted only if the agency 
head or senior agency official of the originating agency:

(1) determines in writing that access is consistent with the interest of 
the national security;

(2) takes appropriate steps to protect classified information from 
unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the information is 
safeguarded in a manner consistent with this order; and

(3) limits the access granted to former Presidential appointees or 
designees and Vice Presidential appointees or designees to items that the 
person originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as a

Executive Order 13527 of December 30, 2009

Establishing Federal Capability for the Timely Provision of Medical 
Countermeasures Following a Biological Attack

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to plan and 
prepare for the timely provision of medical countermeasures to the 
American people in the event of a biological attack in the United States 
through a rapid Federal response in coordination with State, local, 
territorial, and tribal governments.
This policy would seek to: (1) mitigate illness and prevent death; (2) 
sustain critical infrastructure; and (3) complement and supplement 
State, local, territorial, and tribal government medical countermeasure 
distribution capacity.
Sec. 2. United States Postal Service Delivery of Medical 
Countermeasures. (a) The U.S. Postal Service has the capacity for rapid 
residential delivery of medical countermeasures for self administration 
across all communities in the United States. The Federal Government 
shall pursue a national U.S. Postal Service medical countermeasures 
dispensing model to respond to a large-scale biological attack.
(b) The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, 
in coordination with the U.S. Postal Service, within 180 days of the 
date of this order, shall establish a national U.S. Postal Service 
medical countermeasures dispensing model for U.S. cities to respond to a 
large-scale biological attack, with anthrax as the primary threat 
consideration.
(c) In support of the national U.S. Postal Service model, the 
Secretaries of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and 
Defense, and the Attorney General, in coordination with the U.S. Postal 
Service, and in consultation with State and local public health, 
emergency management, and law enforcement officials, within 180 days of 
the date of this order, shall develop an accompanying plan for 
supplementing local law enforcement personnel, as necessary and 
appropriate, with local Federal law enforcement, as well as other 
appropriate personnel, to escort U.S. Postal workers delivering medical 
countermeasures.
Sec. 3. Federal Rapid Response. (a) The Federal Government must develop 
the capacity to anticipate and immediately supplement the capabilities 
of affected jurisdictions to rapidly distribute medical countermeasures 
following a biological attack. Implementation of a Federal strategy to 
rapidly dispense medical countermeasures requires establishment of a 
Federal rapid response capability.
(b) The Secretaries of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, 
in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, within 90 days of the 
date of this order, shall develop a concept of operations and establish 
requirements for a Federal rapid response to dispense medical 
countermeasures to an affected population following a large-scale 
biological attack.
Sec. 4. Continuity of Operations. (a) The Federal Government must 
establish mechanisms for the provision of medical countermeasures to 
personnel performing mission-essential functions to ensure that mission-
essential functions of Federal agencies continue to be performed 
following a biological attack.
(b) The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, 
within 180 days of the date of this order, shall develop a plan for the 
provision of medical countermeasures to ensure that mission-essential 
functions of executive branch departments and agencies continue to be 
performed following a large-scale biological attack.
Sec. 5. General Provisions.
(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:
    (i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or
    (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Presidential Determination No. 2009-10 of January 1, 2009

Waiver of Reimbursement Under the United Nations Participation Act to 
Support the United Nations/African Union Mission in Darfur

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 10(d)(1) of the 
United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287e-
2(d)(1)), I hereby determine that provision of assistance to the United 
Nations/African Union Mission in Darfur to support the airlift of 
equipment for peacekeeping in Darfur without reimbursement from the 
United Nations is important to the security interests of the United 
States.
You are authorized and directed to report this determination to the 
Congress and to arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 2009-11 of January 15, 2009

Limited Waiver of Certain Sanctions Imposed by, and Delegation of 
Certain Authorities Pursuant to, the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE 
(Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of the 
Treasury
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws 
of the United States, including the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE 
(Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-286) (JADE 
Act) and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, in order to ensure 
that the United States Government's sanctions against the Burmese 
leadership and its supporters continue to be implemented effectively, to 
allow the reconciliation of measures applicable to persons sanctioned 
under the JADE Act with measures applicable to the same persons 
sanctioned under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and to allow for the implementation of additional 
appropriate sanctions:
(1) I hereby waive, pursuant to section 5(i) of the JADE Act, the 
provisions of section 5(b) of the JADE Act with respect to those persons 
described in section 5(a)(1) of the JADE Act who are not included on the 
Department of the Treasury's List of Specially Designated Nationals and 
Blocked Persons. Because the imposition of effective and meaningful 
blocking sanctions requires the identification of those individuals and 
entities targeted for sanction and the authorization of certain limited 
exceptions to the prohibitions and restrictions that would otherwise 
apply, I hereby determine and certify that such a limited waiver is in 
the national interest of the United States.
(2) I hereby delegate to the Secretary of the Treasury the waiver 
authority set forth in section 5(i) of the JADE Act, including the 
authority to invoke or revoke the waiver with respect to any person or 
persons or any transaction or category of transactions or prohibitions 
by making the necessary determination and certification regarding the 
national interest of the United States set forth in that section. I 
hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State and with necessary support from the Intelligence 
Community, as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 
1947, as amended (50 U.S.C. 401a(4)), to continue to target aggressively 
the Burmese regime and its lines of support. I further delegate to the 
Secretary of the Treasury the authority to take such actions as may be 
necessary to carry out the purposes of section 5(b) of the JADE Act. The 
Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other 
officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with 
applicable law. The authorities delegated to the Secretary of the 
Treasury under this memorandum shall be exercised after consultation 
with the Secretary of State.
(3) I authorize the Secretary of State, after consultation with the 
Secretary of the Treasury, to take such actions as may be necessary to 
make the submissions to the appropriate congressional committees 
pursuant to section 5(d) of the JADE Act.
I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of the Treasury to report 
this determination to the appropriate congressional committees and to 
publish it in the Federal Register.

I have considered the proposed Agreement for Cooperation Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
United Arab Emirates Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, along 
with the views, recommendations, and statements of the interested

I have determined that the performance of the Agreement will promote,

security. Pursuant to section 123 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b)), I hereby approve the proposed Agreement 
and authorize the Secretary of State to arrange for its execution.

Notice of January 15, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on subsequent 
occasions, the Cuban government stated its intent to forcefully defend 
its sovereignty against any U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft that 
might enter Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a 
flotilla or peaceful protest. Since these events, the Cuban government 
has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the future use of 
reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may 
engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. On 
February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757, the scope of the national 
emergency was expanded in order to deny monetary and material support to 
the repressive Cuban government, which had taken a series of steps to 
destabilize relations with the United States, including threatening to 
abrogate the Migration Accords with the United States and to close the 
United States Interests Section. Further, Cuba's most senior officials 
repeatedly asserted that the United States intended to invade Cuba, 
despite explicit denials from the U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense 
that such action is planned. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency 
authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of 
vessels set out in Proclamation 6867 as amended and expanded by 
Proclamation 7757.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of January 15, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency with Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten to Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four 
additional persons, including Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt 
the Middle East peace process.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, as expanded on August 
20, 1998, and the measures adopted on those dates to deal with that 
emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2009. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of January 21, 2009

Pay Freeze

Memorandum for the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff
The United States is in a period of severe economic stress. Too many 
Americans have lost their jobs, their homes, their health insurance, or 
a substantial part of their retirement savings, and many more feel 
uncertain about the future.
In these circumstances, Government must act forcefully and creatively to 
stimulate our economic recovery, investing in infrastructure, innovative 
energy technologies, and education. It must act quickly to provide 
assistance to average Americans.
Many have accepted the call to serve in Government and to assist me in 
restoring a sound economy and in improving the lives of average 
Americans. In this challenging economic period, it is only appropriate 
that senior officials on the White House staff forgo pay increases until 
further notice.
Accordingly, as a signal of our shared commitment to restoring the 
country's economic vitality and because of the serious economic 
conditions we are facing, I intend to freeze the salaries of senior 
members of the White House staff, to the extent permitted by law. I 
direct you to report back to me within 30 days with recommendations for 
actions to implement this freeze.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a 
party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Memorandum of January 21, 2009

Freedom of Information Act

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires 
transparency. As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, ``sunlight is said to be 
the best of disinfectants.'' In our democracy, the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through 
transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national 
commitment to ensuring an open Government. At the heart of that 
commitment is the idea that accountability is in the interest of the 
Government and the citizenry alike.
The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear 
presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails. The Government 
should not keep information confidential merely because public officials 
might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be 
revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears. Nondisclosure 
should never be based on an effort to protect the personal interests of 
Government officials at the expense of those they are supposed to serve. 
In responding to requests under the FOIA, executive branch agencies 
(agencies) should act promptly and in a spirit of cooperation, 
recognizing that such agencies are servants of the public.
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order 
to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to 
usher in a new era of open Government. The presumption of disclosure 
should be applied to all decisions involving FOIA.
The presumption of disclosure also means that agencies should take 
affirmative steps to make information public. They should not wait for 
specific requests from the public. All agencies should use modern 
technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their 
Government. Disclosure should be timely.
I direct the Attorney General to issue new guidelines governing the FOIA 
to the heads of executive departments and agencies, reaffirming the 
commitment to accountability and transparency, and to publish such 
guidelines in the Federal Register. In doing so, the Attorney General 
should review FOIA reports produced by the agencies under Executive 
Order 13392 of December 14, 2005. I also direct the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget to update guidance to the agencies to 
increase and improve information dissemination to the public, including 
through the use of new technologies, and to publish such guidance in the 
Federal Register.
This memorandum does not create any right or benefit, substantive or 
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the 
United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized 
and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of January 21, 2009

Transparency and Open Government

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of 
openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust 
and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and 
collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote 
efficiency and effectiveness in Government.
Government should be transparent. Transparency promotes accountability 
and provides information for citizens about what their Government is 
doing. Information maintained by the Federal Government is a national 
asset. My Administration will take appropriate action, consistent with 
law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public 
can readily find and use. Executive departments and agencies should 
harness new technologies to put information about their operations and 
decisions online and readily available to the public. Executive 
departments and agencies should also solicit public feedback to identify 
information of greatest use to the public.
Government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the 
Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. 
Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and public officials benefit 
from having access to that dispersed knowledge. Executive departments 
and agencies should offer Americans increased opportunities to 
participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the 
benefits of their collective expertise and information. Executive 
departments and agencies should also solicit public input on how we can 
increase and improve opportunities for public participation in 
Government.
Government should be collaborative. Collaboration actively engages 
Americans in the work of their Government. Executive departments and 
agencies should use innovative tools, methods, and systems to cooperate 
among themselves, across all levels of Government, and with nonprofit 
organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector. 
Executive departments and agencies should solicit public feedback to 
assess and improve their level of collaboration and to identify new 
opportunities for cooperation.
I direct the Chief Technology Officer, in coordination with the Director 
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Administrator of 
General Services, to coordinate the development by appropriate executive 
departments and agencies, within 120 days, of recommendations for an 
Open Government Directive, to be issued by the Director of OMB, that 
instructs executive departments and agencies to take specific actions 
implementing the principles set forth in this memorandum. The 
independent agencies should comply with the Open Government Directive.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a 
party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of January 23, 2009

Mexico City Policy and Assistance for Voluntary Population Planning

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Administrator of the 
United States Agency for International Development
The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)(1)), prohibits 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that receive Federal funds from 
using those funds ``to pay for the performance of abortions as a method 
of family planning, or to motivate or coerce any person to practice 
abortions.'' The August 1984 announcement by President Reagan of what 
has become known as the ``Mexico City Policy'' directed the United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID) to expand this 
limitation and withhold USAID funds from NGOs that use non-USAID funds 
to engage in a wide range of activities, including providing advice, 
counseling, or information regarding abortion, or lobbying a foreign 
government to legalize or make abortion available. The Mexico City 
Policy was in effect from 1985 until 1993, when it was rescinded by 
President Clinton. President George W. Bush reinstated the policy in 
2001, implementing it through conditions in USAID grant awards, and 
subsequently extended the policy to ``voluntary population planning'' 
assistance provided by the Department of State.
These excessively broad conditions on grants and assistance awards are 
unwarranted. Moreover, they have undermined efforts to promote safe and 
effective voluntary family planning programs in foreign nations. 
Accordingly, I hereby revoke the Presidential memorandum of January 22, 
2001, for the Administrator of USAID (Restoration of the Mexico City 
Policy), the Presidential memorandum of March 28, 2001, for the 
Administrator of USAID (Restoration of the Mexico City Policy), and the 
Presidential memorandum of August 29, 2003, for the Secretary of State 
(Assistance for Voluntary Population Planning). In addition, I direct 
the Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID to take the 
following actions with respect to conditions in voluntary population 
planning assistance and USAID grants that were imposed pursuant to 
either the 2001 or 2003 memoranda and that are not required by the 
Foreign Assistance Act or any other law: (1) immediately waive such 
conditions in any current grants, and (2) notify current grantees, as 
soon as possible, that these conditions have been waived. I further 
direct that the Department of State and USAID immediately cease imposing 
these conditions in any future grants.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

State of California Request for Waiver Under 42 U.S.C. 7543(b), the 
Clean Air Act

Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
Under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q), the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) sets emissions standards for new motor vehicles. 
California may also adopt standards for new motor vehicles if the 
Administrator of the EPA, based on criteria set out in the statute, 
waives the general statutory prohibition on State adoption or 
enforcement of emissions standards. Other States may adopt emissions 
standards for new motor vehicles if they are identical to the California 
standards for which a waiver has been granted and comply with other 
statutory criteria.
For decades, the EPA has granted the State of California such waivers. 
The EPA's final decision to deny California's application for a waiver 
permitting the State to adopt limitations on greenhouse gas emissions 
from motor vehicles was published in the Federal Register on March 6, 
2008.
In order to ensure that the EPA carries out its responsibilities for 
improving air quality, you are hereby requested to assess whether the 
EPA's decision to deny a waiver based on California's application was 
appropriate in light of the Clean Air Act. I further request that, based 
on that assessment, the EPA initiate any appropriate action.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007

Memorandum for the Secretary of Transportation [and] the Administrator 
of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

In 2007, the Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act 
(EISA). This law mandates that, as part of the Nation's efforts to 
achieve energy independence, the Secretary of Transportation prescribe 
annual fuel economy increases for automobiles, beginning with model year 
2011, resulting in a combined fuel economy fleet average of at least 35 
miles per gallon by model year 2020. On May 2, 2008, the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking entitled Average Fuel Economy Standards, Passenger 
Cars and Light Trucks; Model Years 2011-2015, 73 Fed. Reg. 24352. In the 
notice and comment period, the NHTSA received numerous comments, some of 
them contending that certain aspects of the proposed rule, including 
appendices providing for preemption of State laws, were inconsistent 
with provisions of EISA and the Supreme Court's decision in 
Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 549 U.S. 497 (2007).
Federal law requires that the final rule regarding fuel economy 
standards be adopted at least 18 months before the beginning of the 
model year (49 U.S.C. 32902(g)(2)). In order for the model year 2011 
standards to meet this requirement, the NHTSA must publish the final 
rule in the Federal Register by March 30, 2009. To date, the NHTSA has 
not published a final rule.
Therefore, I request that:
(a) in order to comply with the EISA requirement that fuel economy 
increases begin with model year 2011, you take all measures consistent 
with law, and in coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency, 
to publish in the Federal Register by March 30, 2009, a final rule 
prescribing increased fuel economy for model year 2011;
(b) before promulgating a final rule concerning model years after model 
year 2011, you consider the appropriate legal factors under the EISA, 
the comments filed in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the 
relevant technological and scientific considerations, and to the extent 
feasible, the forthcoming report by the National Academy of Sciences 
mandated under section 107 of EISA; and
(c) in adopting the final rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, you 
consider whether any provisions regarding preemption are consistent with 
the EISA, the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA and other 
relevant provisions of law and the policies underlying them.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Secretary of Transportation is hereby authorized and directed to 
publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Regulatory Review

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
For well over two decades, the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has reviewed 
Federal regulations. The purposes of such review have been to ensure 
consistency with Presidential priorities, to coordinate regulatory 
policy, and to offer a dispassionate and analytical ``second opinion'' 
on agency actions. I strongly believe that regulations are critical to 
protecting public health, safety, our shared resources, and our economic 
opportunities and security. While recognizing the expertise and 
authority of executive branch departments and agencies, I also believe 
that, if properly conducted, centralized review is both legitimate and 
appropriate as a means of promoting regulatory goals.
The fundamental principles and structures governing contemporary 
regulatory review were set out in Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 
1993. A great deal has been learned since that time. Far more is now 
known about regulation--not only about when it is justified, but also 
about what works and what does not. Far more is also known about the 
uses of a variety of regulatory tools such as warnings, disclosure 
requirements, public education, and economic incentives. Years of 
experience have also provided lessons about how to improve the process 
of regulatory review. In this time of fundamental transformation, that 
process--and the principles governing regulation in general--should be 
revisited.
I therefore direct the Director of OMB, in consultation with 
representatives of regulatory agencies, as appropriate, to produce 
within 100 days a set of recommendations for a new Executive Order on 
Federal regulatory review. Among other things, the recommendations 
should offer suggestions for the relationship between OIRA and the 
agencies; provide guidance on disclosure and transparency; encourage 
public participation in agency regulatory processes; offer suggestions 
on the role of cost-benefit analysis; address the role of distributional 
considerations, fairness, and concern for the interests of future 
generations; identify methods of ensuring that regulatory review does 
not produce undue delay; clarify the role of the behavioral sciences in 
formulating regulatory policy; and identify the best tools for achieving 
public goals through the regulatory process.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

White House Task Force on Middle-Class Working Families

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
For many years, middle-class Americans have been working harder, yet not 
enjoying their fair share of the fruits of a growing economy. While the 
productivity of the American workforce grew during the decade ending in 
2007, middle-income workers saw their real incomes fall. The current 
economic situation has exacerbated the challenges facing middle-class 
Americans, with health care coverage, safe and steady employment 
opportunities, effective and affordable education, owning a home, and 
saving for retirement slipping out of reach. It is a high priority of my 
Administration to achieve a secure future for middle-class working 
families, one in which they share in prosperous times and are cushioned 
during hard times. To these ends, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. White House Task Force on Middle-Class Working Families. 
There is established within the Office of the Vice President, a White 
House Task Force on Middle-Class Working Families (Task Force) to focus 
on raising the living standards of middle-class working families in the 
United States of America. The Vice President shall serve as Chair of the 
Task Force.
(a) Membership of the Task Force. In addition to the Vice President, the 
Task Force shall consist exclusively of the heads of the executive 
branch departments, agencies, and offices listed below:
    (1) the Department of Commerce;
    (2) the Department of Labor;
    (3) the Department of Health and Human Services;
    (4) the Department of Education;
    (5) the Office of Management and Budget;
    (6) the National Economic Council;
    (7) the Domestic Policy Council;
    (8) the Council of Economic Advisers; and
    (9) such other executive branch departments, agencies, or offices as 
the President may designate.
A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force 
functions of the member, any person who is a part of the member's 
department, agency, or office, and who is a full-time officer or 
employee of the Federal Government. At the direction of the Chair, the 
Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force 
members or their designees under this section, as appropriate.
(b) Administration of the Task Force. The Department of Labor shall 
provide funding and administrative support for the Task Force to the 
extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. The Vice 
President shall designate an Executive Director of the Task Force, who 
shall coordinate the work of the Task Force.
Sec. 2. Mission and Functions of the Task Force. The Task Force shall 
work with a wide array of executive departments and agencies that have 
responsibility for key issues facing middle-class working families, 
expedite administrative reforms, propose Executive Orders, and develop 
legislative and policy proposals that can be of special importance to 
middle-class working families. The functions of the Task Force are 
advisory only and shall include, but shall not be limited to, producing 
a detailed set of recommendations to:
    (a) expand education and lifelong training opportunities;
    (b) improve work and family balance;
    (c) restore labor standards, including workplace safety;
    (d) protect the incomes of middle-class working families; and
    (e) protect retirement security.
Sec. 3. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives set out in section 2 of 
this memorandum, the Task Force, in accordance with applicable law, in 
addition to regular meetings, shall conduct outreach with 
representatives of labor, business, nonprofit organizations, State and 
local government agencies, and other interested persons that will assist 
with the Task Force's development of a detailed set of recommendations.
Sec. 4. Transparency and Reports. The Task Force shall facilitate the 
posting on the Internet of submissions by outside parties and engage in 
an open, two-way dialogue with the American people. The Task Force shall 
present to the President annual reports, beginning 1 year from the date 
of this memorandum, on its findings and recommendations, which shall be 
made available to the public and posted on the Internet.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) The heads of executive departments and 
agencies shall assist and provide information to the Task Force, 
consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the 
functions of the Task Force. Each executive department and agency shall 
bear its own expense for participating in the Task Force.
(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:
    (i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or 
the head thereof; or
    (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity 
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 6. Publication. The Secretary of Labor is authorized and directed 
to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

State Children's Health Insurance Program

Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services
The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) encourages States 
to provide health coverage for uninsured children in families whose 
incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford 
private insurance. Since 1997, when SCHIP was enacted, States have had 
the authority to set their SCHIP income eligibility levels, subject to 
available funding. In recent years, as the cost of private insurance has 
increased, States have raised eligibility levels to offer health care 
coverage to more families, with families paying a share of the cost 
based on their income.
 On August 17, 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
issued a letter to State health officials limiting the flexibility of 
States to set income eligibility standards for their SCHIP programs. On 
May 7, 2008, CMS issued a subsequent letter restating the policy set 
forth in the August 17, 2007, letter.
 The August 17, 2007, letter imposes additional requirements that States 
must meet in order to cover children under SCHIP plans, including plans 
that CMS had previously approved. These requirements have limited 
coverage under several State plans that otherwise would have covered 
additional, uninsured children. As a result, tens of thousands of 
children have been denied health care coverage. Unless the August 17, 
2007, letter is withdrawn, many more children will be denied coverage.
 By this memorandum, I request that you immediately withdraw the August 
17, 2007, and May 7, 2008, letters to State health officials and 
implement SCHIP without the requirements imposed by those letters.
 This memorandum does not create any right or benefit, substantive or 
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the 
United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.
 You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in 
or in Relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire

 On February 7, 2006, by Executive Order 13396, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons contributing to the conflict in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, 
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701-1706). The President took this action to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the situation in or in relation to 
C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, which has been addressed by the United Nations 
Security Council in Resolution 1572 of November 15, 2004, and subsequent 
resolutions, and has resulted in the massacre of large numbers of 
civilians, widespread human rights abuses, significant political 
violence and unrest, and attacks against international peacekeeping 
forces leading to fatalities. Because the situation in or in relation to 
C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, 
the national emergency declared on February 7, 2006, and the measures 
adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in 
effect beyond February 7, 2009.
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13396.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Appliance Efficiency Standards

Memorandum for the Secretary of Energy
Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA), the 
Department of Energy (DOE) is required to establish by certain dates 
energy efficiency standards for a broad class of residential and 
commercial products. These products are appliances and other equipment 
used in consumers' homes and in commercial establishments. In the Energy 
Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT), the Congress directed the DOE to develop a 
plan to issue expeditiously efficiency standards for those products with 
respect to which the Department had not yet met the deadlines specified 
in the EPCA.
In 2005, 14 States and various other entities brought suit alleging that 
the DOE had failed to comply with deadlines and other requirements in 
the EPCA. In November 2006, the DOE entered into a consent decree under 
which the DOE agreed to publish final rules regarding 22 product 
categories by specific deadlines, the latest of which is June 30, 2011. 
The consent decree includes target dates for the rulemaking processes 
and sets deadlines for issuance of final rules with respect to each 
product category. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 
(EISA) directed the DOE to establish energy standards for additional 
product categories.
The DOE remains subject to outstanding deadlines with respect to 15 of 
the 22 product categories covered by the consent decree, as well as 
statutory deadlines for a number of additional product categories. These 
efficiency standards, once implemented, will result in significant 
energy savings for the American people.
 Therefore, I request that:
     (a) the DOE take all necessary steps, consistent with the consent 
decree, EPACT, and EISA, to finalize legally required efficiency 
standards as expeditiously as possible and consistent with all 
applicable judicial and statutory deadlines. Such standards include, 
most immediately, those covered by the five energy efficiency rules with 
deadlines prior to and including August 8, 2009;
     (b) with respect to standards subject to judicial and statutory 
deadlines later than August 8, 2009, the DOE work to complete prior to 
the applicable deadline those standards that will result in the greatest 
energy savings. To undertake this task, the DOE should quantify, to the 
extent feasible and consistent with statutory requirements, the expected 
annual energy savings from the relevant standards. The DOE must, 
however, ensure that it meets applicable deadlines for all standards.
 This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a 
party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
 You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in 
the Federal Register.

The Endangered Species Act

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The Endangered Species Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq., reflects one 
of the Nation's profound commitments. Pursuant to that Act, the Federal 
Government has long required a process of broad interagency consultation 
to ensure the application of scientific and technical expertise to 
decisions that may affect threatened or endangered species. Under that 
interagency process, executive departments and agencies (agencies) 
contemplating an action that may affect endangered or threatened species 
have long been required, except in certain limited circumstances, to 
consult with, and in some circumstances obtain the prior written 
concurrence of, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and/or the National 
Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)--the expert agencies that have the 
primary responsibility to ensure that the ESA is implemented in 
accordance with the law.
On December 16, 2008, the Departments of the Interior and Commerce 
issued a joint regulation that modified these longstanding requirements. 
See 73 Fed. Reg. 76272. This new regulation expands the circumstances in 
which an agency may determine not to consult with, or obtain the written 
concurrence of, the FWS or NMFS prior to undertaking an action that may 
affect threatened or endangered species. But under the new regulation, 
agencies may continue the previous practice of consulting with, and 
obtaining the written concurrence of, the FWS and NMFS as a matter of 
discretion.
I hereby request the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to review 
the regulation issued on December 16, 2008, and to determine whether to 
undertake new rulemaking procedures with respect to consultative and 
concurrence processes that will promote the purposes of the ESA.
Until such review is completed, I request the heads of all agencies to 
exercise their discretion, under the new regulation, to follow the prior 
longstanding consultation and concurrence practices involving the FWS 
and NMFS.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. 
Agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent 
permitted by law and consistent with statutory authorities.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a 
national emergency and blocked the property of persons undermining 
democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). He 
took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other 
persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. 
These actions have contributed to the deliberate breakdown in the rule 
of law in Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and intimidation, 
and to political and economic instability in the southern African 
region.
On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13391 to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13288 by ordering the blocking of the property of 
additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Zimbabwe.
On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13469, which 
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288 and ordered the blocking of the property of additional persons 
undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date, on November 22, 2005, and on July 25, 
2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 
6, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of March 4, 2009

Government Contracting

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The Federal Government has an overriding obligation to American 
taxpayers. It should perform its functions efficiently and effectively 
while ensuring that its actions result in the best value for the 
taxpayers.
Since 2001, spending on Government contracts has more than doubled, 
reaching over $500 billion in 2008. During this same period, there has 
been a significant increase in the dollars awarded without full and open 
competition and an increase in the dollars obligated through cost-
reimbursement contracts. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, for 
example, dollars obligated under cost-reimbursement contracts nearly 
doubled, from $71 billion in 2000 to $135 billion in 2008. Reversing 
these trends away from full and open competition and toward cost-
reimbursement contracts could result in savings of billions of dollars 
each year for the American taxpayer.
Excessive reliance by executive agencies on sole-source contracts (or 
contracts with a limited number of sources) and cost-reimbursement 
contracts creates a risk that taxpayer funds will be spent on contracts 
that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise not well 
designed to serve the needs of the Federal Government or the interests 
of the American taxpayer. Reports by agency Inspectors General, the 
Government Accountability Office (GAO), and other independent reviewing 
bodies have shown that noncompetitive and cost-reimbursement contracts 
have been misused, resulting in wasted taxpayer resources, poor 
contractor performance, and inadequate accountability for results.
When awarding Government contracts, the Federal Government must strive 
for an open and competitive process. However, executive agencies must 
have the flexibility to tailor contracts to carry out their missions and 
achieve the policy goals of the Government. In certain exigent 
circumstances, agencies may need to consider whether a competitive 
process will not accomplish the agency's mission. In such cases, the 
agency must ensure that the risks associated with noncompetitive 
contracts are minimized.
Moreover, it is essential that the Federal Government have the capacity 
to carry out robust and thorough management and oversight of its 
contracts in order to achieve programmatic goals, avoid significant 
overcharges, and curb wasteful spending. A GAO study last year of 95 
major defense acquisitions projects found cost overruns of 26 percent, 
totaling $295 billion over the life of the projects. Improved contract 
oversight could reduce such sums significantly.
Government outsourcing for services also raises special concerns. For 
decades, the Federal Government has relied on the private sector for 
necessary commercial services used by the Government, such as 
transportation, food, and maintenance. Office of Management and Budget 
Circular A-76, first issued in 1966, was based on the reasonable premise 
that while inherently governmental activities should be performed by 
Government employees, taxpayers may receive more value for their dollars 
if non-inherently governmental activities that can be provided 
commercially are subject to the forces of competition.
However, the line between inherently governmental activities that should 
not be outsourced and commercial activities that may be subject to 
private sector competition has been blurred and inadequately defined. As 
a result, contractors may be performing inherently governmental 
functions. Agencies and departments must operate under clear rules 
prescribing when outsourcing is and is not appropriate.
It is the policy of the Federal Government that executive agencies shall 
not engage in noncompetitive contracts except in those circumstances 
where their use can be fully justified and where appropriate safeguards 
have been put in place to protect the taxpayer. In addition, there shall 
be a preference for fixed-price type contracts. Cost-reimbursement 
contracts shall be used only when circumstances do not allow the agency 
to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type 
contract. Moreover, the Federal Government shall ensure that taxpayer 
dollars are not spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, 
subject to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the Federal 
Government's needs and to manage the risk associated with the goods and 
services being procured. The Federal Government must have sufficient 
capacity to manage and oversee the contracting process from start to 
finish, so as to ensure that taxpayer funds are spent wisely and are not 
subject to excessive risk. Finally, the Federal Government must ensure 
that those functions that are inherently governmental in nature are 
performed by executive agencies and are not outsourced.
I hereby direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator 
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator 
of General Services, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, 
and the heads of such other agencies as the Director of OMB determines 
to be appropriate, and with the participation of appropriate management 
councils and program management officials, to develop and issue by July 
1, 2009, Government-wide guidance to assist agencies in reviewing, and 
creating processes for ongoing review of, existing contracts in order to 
identify contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, or not otherwise 
likely to meet the agency's needs, and to formulate appropriate 
corrective action in a timely manner. Such corrective action may include 
modifying or canceling such contracts in a manner and to the extent 
consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and policy.
I further direct the Director of OMB, in collaboration with the 
aforementioned officials and councils, and with input from the public, 
to develop and issue by September 30, 2009, Government-wide guidance to:
    (1) govern the appropriate use and oversight of sole-source and 
other types of noncompetitive contracts and to maximize the use of full 
and open competition and other competitive procurement processes;
    (2) govern the appropriate use and oversight of all contract types, 
in full consideration of the agency's needs, and to minimize risk and 
maximize the value of Government contracts generally, consistent with 
the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to section 864 of Public Law 
110-417;
    (3) assist agencies in assessing the capacity and ability of the 
Federal acquisition workforce to develop, manage, and oversee 
acquisitions appropriately; and
    (4) clarify when governmental outsourcing for services is and is not 
appropriate, consistent with section 321 of Public Law 110-417 (31 
U.S.C. 501 note).
Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of 
this memorandum to the extent permitted by law. This memorandum is not 
intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or 
procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the 
United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of March 9, 2009

Presidential Signing Statements

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
For nearly two centuries, Presidents have issued statements addressing 
constitutional or other legal questions upon signing bills into law 
(signing statements). Particularly since omnibus bills have become 
prevalent, signing statements have often been used to ensure that 
concerns about the constitutionality of discrete statutory provisions do 
not require a veto of the entire bill.
In recent years, there has been considerable public discussion and 
criticism of the use of signing statements to raise constitutional 
objections to statutory provisions. There is no doubt that the practice 
of issuing such statements can be abused. Constitutional signing 
statements should not be used to suggest that the President will 
disregard statutory requirements on the basis of policy disagreements. 
At the same time, such signing statements serve a legitimate function in 
our system, at least when based on well-founded constitutional 
objections. In appropriately limited circumstances, they represent an 
exercise of the President's constitutional obligation to take care that 
the laws be faithfully executed, and they promote a healthy dialogue 
between the executive branch and the Congress.
With these considerations in mind and based upon advice of the 
Department of Justice, I will issue signing statements to address 
constitutional concerns only when it is appropriate to do so as a means 
of discharging my constitutional responsibilities. In issuing signing 
statements, I shall adhere to the following principles:

1. The executive branch will take appropriate and timely steps, whenever 
practicable, to inform the Congress of its constitutional concerns about 
pending legislation. Such communication should facilitate the efforts of 
the executive branch and the Congress to work together to address these 
concerns during the legislative process, thus minimizing the number of 
occasions on which I am presented with an enrolled bill that may require a 
signing statement.

2. Because legislation enacted by the Congress comes with a presumption of 
constitutionality, I will strive to avoid the conclusion that any part of 
an enrolled bill is unconstitutional. In exercising my responsibility to 
determine whether a provision of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional, I 
will act with caution and restraint, based only on interpretations of the 
Constitution that are well-founded.

3. To promote transparency and accountability, I will ensure that signing 
statements identify my constitutional concerns about a statutory provision 
with sufficient specificity to make clear the nature and basis of the 
constitutional objection.

4. I will announce in signing statements that I will construe a statutory 
provision in a manner that avoids a constitutional problem only if that 
construction is a legitimate one.

To ensure that all signing statements previously issued are followed 
only when consistent with these principles, executive branch departments 
and agencies are directed to seek the advice of the Attorney General 
before relying on signing statements issued prior to the date of this 
memorandum as the basis for disregarding, or otherwise refusing to 
comply with, any provision of a statute.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of March 9, 2009

Scientific Integrity

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Science and the scientific process must inform and guide decisions of my 
Administration on a wide range of issues, including improvement of 
public health, protection of the environment, increased efficiency in 
the use of energy and other resources, mitigation of the threat of 
climate change, and protection of national security.
The public must be able to trust the science and scientific process 
informing public policy decisions. Political officials should not 
suppress or alter scientific or technological findings and conclusions. 
If scientific and technological information is developed and used by the 
Federal Government, it should ordinarily be made available to the 
public. To the extent permitted by law, there should be transparency in 
the preparation, identification, and use of scientific and technological 
information in policymaking. The selection of scientists and technology 
professionals for positions in the executive branch should be based on 
their scientific and technological knowledge, credentials, experience, 
and integrity.
By this memorandum, I assign to the Director of the Office of Science 
and Technology Policy (Director) the responsibility for ensuring the 
highest level of integrity in all aspects of the executive branch's 
involvement with scientific and technological processes. The Director 
shall confer, as appropriate, with the heads of executive departments 
and agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget and offices 
and agencies within the Executive Office of the President (collectively, 
the ``agencies''), and recommend a plan to achieve that goal throughout 
the executive branch.
Specifically, I direct the following:

1. Within 120 days from the date of this memorandum, the Director shall 
develop recommendations for Presidential action designed to guarantee 
scientific integrity throughout the executive branch, based on the 
following principles:

    (a) The selection and retention of candidates for science and 
technology positions in the executive branch should be based on 
the candidate's knowledge, credentials, experience, and integrity;
    (b) Each agency should have appropriate rules and procedures 
to ensure the integrity of the scientific process within the 
agency;
    (c) When scientific or technological information is considered 
in policy decisions, the information should be subject to well-
established scientific processes, including peer review where 
appropriate, and each agency should appropriately and accurately 
reflect that information in complying with and applying relevant 
statutory standards;
    (d) Except for information that is properly restricted from 
disclosure under procedures established in accordance with 
statute, regulation, Executive Order, or Presidential Memorandum, 
each agency should make available to the public the scientific or 
technological findings or conclusions considered or relied on in 
policy decisions;
    (e) Each agency should have in place procedures to identify 
and address instances in which the scientific process or the 
integrity of scientific and technological information may be 
compromised; and
    (f) Each agency should adopt such additional procedures, 
including any appropriate whistleblower protections, as are 
necessary to ensure the integrity of scientific and technological 
information and processes on which the agency relies in its 
decisionmaking or otherwise uses or prepares.

2. Each agency shall make available any and all information deemed by the 
Director to be necessary to inform the Director in making recommendations 
to the President as requested by this memorandum. Each agency shall 
coordinate with the Director in the development of any interim procedures 
deemed necessary to ensure the integrity of scientific decisionmaking 
pending the Director's recommendations called for by this memorandum.

3. (a) Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of 
this memorandum to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their 
statutory and regulatory authorities and their enforcement mechanisms.

    (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:
(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, 
or the head thereof; or
(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative 
proposals.
    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create 
any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at 
law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its 
departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or 
agents, or any other person.

4. The Director is hereby authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of March 11, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued 
Executive Order 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat, and on August 19, 1997, the President issued 
Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is 
distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2008. This notice shall 
be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Memorandum of March 20, 2009

Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
My Administration is committed to ensuring that public funds are 
expended responsibly and in a transparent manner. Last month, I signed 
into law the ``American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,'' Public 
Law 111-5 (the ``Recovery Act'' or ``Act''), an investment package 
designed to provide a necessary boost to our economy in these difficult 
times and to create jobs, restore economic growth, and strengthen 
America's middle class. The Recovery Act is designed to stimulate the 
economy through measures that, among other things, modernize the 
Nation's infrastructure, jump start American energy independence, expand 
high-quality educational opportunities, preserve and improve access to 
affordable health care, provide middle-class tax relief, and protect 
those in greatest need. It is not intended to fund projects for special 
interests.
In implementing the Recovery Act, we have undertaken unprecedented 
efforts to ensure the responsible distribution of funds for the Act's 
purposes and to provide public transparency and accountability of 
expenditures. We must not allow Recovery Act funds to be distributed on 
the basis of factors other than the merits of proposed projects or in 
response to improper influence or pressure. We must also empower 
executive department and agency officials to exercise their available 
discretion and judgment to help ensure that Recovery Act funds are 
expended for projects that further the job creation, economic recovery, 
and other purposes of the Recovery Act and are not used for imprudent 
projects.
To these ends, I hereby direct that for any further commitments, 
obligations, or expenditures of funds under the Recovery Act, the head 
of each executive department or agency shall immediately take all 
necessary steps, to the extent consistent with the Act and other 
applicable law, to comply with this memorandum.
Section 1. Ensuring Merit-Based Decisionmaking for Grants and Other 
Forms of Federal Financial Assistance Under the Recovery Act. (a) 
Executive departments and agencies shall develop transparent, merit-
based selection criteria that will guide their available discretion in 
committing, obligating, or expending funds under the Recovery Act for 
grants and other forms of Federal financial assistance. Such criteria 
shall be consistent with legal requirements, may be tailored to the 
particular funding activity, and shall be formulated to ensure that the 
funding furthers the job creation, economic recovery, and other purposes 
of the Recovery Act. To this end, merit-based selection criteria shall 
be designed to support particular projects, applications, or applicants 
for funding that have, to the greatest extent, a demonstrated or 
potential ability to: (i) deliver programmatic results; (ii) achieve 
economic stimulus by optimizing economic activity and the number of jobs 
created or saved in relation to the Federal dollars obligated; (iii) 
achieve long-term public benefits by, for example, investing in 
technological advances in science and health to increase economic 
efficiency and improve quality of life; investing in transportation, 
environmental protection, and other infrastructure that will provide 
long-term economic benefits; fostering energy independence; or improving 
educational quality; and (iv) satisfy the Recovery Act's transparency 
and accountability objectives.
    (b) No considerations contained in oral or written communications 
from any person or entity concerning particular projects, applications, 
or applicants for funding shall supersede or supplant consideration by 
executive departments and agencies of such projects, applications, or 
applicants for funding pursuant to applicable merit-based criteria.
Sec. 2. Avoiding Funding of Imprudent Projects. (a) Funds under the 
Recovery Act shall not be committed, obligated, or expended by any 
executive department or agency, and shall not be used by any State or 
local governmental or private grantee or awardee, to support projects of 
the type described in section 1604 of Division A of the Recovery Act, 
which states that ``[n]one of the funds appropriated or otherwise made 
available in this Act may be used by any State or local government, or 
any private entity, for any casino or other gambling establishment, 
aquarium, zoo, golf course, or swimming pool.''
    (b) In exercising their available discretion to commit, obligate, or 
expend funds under the Recovery Act for grants and other forms of 
Federal financial assistance, executive departments and agencies, to the 
extent permitted by law, shall not approve or otherwise support funding 
for projects that are similar to those described in section 1604 of 
Division A of the Recovery Act.
    (c) In exercising their available discretion to commit, obligate, or 
expend funds under the Recovery Act for grants and other forms of 
Federal financial assistance, executive departments and agencies, to the 
extent permitted by law, shall not approve or otherwise support any 
project, application, or applicant for funding that is imprudent or that 
does not further the job creation, economic recovery, and other purposes 
of the Act. To this end, executive departments and agencies shall 
exercise their available discretion to decline approving or otherwise 
supporting particular projects, applications, or applicants for funding 
unless the department or agency has affirmatively determined, in 
advance, that the project, application, or applicant has a demonstrated 
or potential ability to: (i) deliver programmatic results; (ii) achieve 
economic stimulus by optimizing economic activity and the number of jobs 
created or saved in relation to the Federal dollars obligated; (iii) 
achieve long-term public benefits by, for example, investing in 
technological advances in science and health to increase economic 
efficiency and improve quality of life; investing in transportation, 
environmental protection, and other infrastructure that will provide 
long-term economic benefits; fostering energy independence; or improving 
educational quality; or (iv) satisfy the Recovery Act's transparency and 
accountability objectives.
    (d) Where executive departments or agencies lack discretion under 
the Recovery Act to refuse funding for projects similar to those 
described in section 1604 of Division A of the Act, or other projects 
that the executive department or agency deems imprudent or as not 
furthering the job creation, economic recovery, or other purposes of the 
Act, the department or agency shall consult immediately with the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB) about the project and its funding 
requirements. Where legally permissible, the department or agency shall:

(i) delay funding of the project for 30 days, or the longest period 
permitted by law if less than 30 days, in order to ensure adequate 
opportunity for public scrutiny of the project prior to commitment of 
funds; and

(ii) publish a description of the proposed project (or project plan) and 
its funding requirements on the agency's recovery website as soon as 
practicable before or after commitment, obligation, or expenditure of funds 
for the project.

    (e) Executive departments and agencies, including their respective 
Offices of Inspector General, shall monitor compliance with the 
prohibition in section 1604 of Division A of the Recovery Act, 
referenced in paragraph (a) above, by contractors, grantees, and other 
recipients of Federal financial assistance (recipients). If a department 
or agency believes that a recipient has not complied with section 1604, 
then the department or agency shall (i) promptly notify the Recovery 
Accountability and Transparency Board; and (ii) take appropriate 
corrective action that may include, but not be limited to, disallowing 
or otherwise recovering improperly spent amounts, imposing additional 
requirements on the recipient to ensure compliance with section 1604 
(and other applicable prohibitions and obligations), initiating a 
proceeding for administrative civil penalties, and initiating a 
proceeding for suspension and debarment.
Sec. 3. Ensuring Transparency of Registered Lobbyist Communications. (a) 
An executive department or agency official shall not consider the view 
of a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, 2 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq., concerning particular projects, applications, or 
applicants for funding under the Recovery Act unless such views are in 
writing.
    (b) Upon the scheduling of, and again at the outset of, any oral 
communication (in-person or telephonic) with any person or entity 
concerning particular projects, applications, or applicants for funding 
under the Recovery Act, an executive department or agency official shall 
inquire whether any of the individuals or parties appearing or 
communicating concerning such particular project, application, or 
applicant is a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 
1995. If so, the lobbyist may not attend or participate in the 
telephonic or in-person contact, but may submit a communication in 
writing.
    (c) All written communications from a registered lobbyist concerning 
the commitment, obligation, or expenditure of funds under the Recovery 
Act for particular projects, applications, or applicants shall be posted 
publicly by the receiving agency or governmental entity on its recovery 
website within 3 business days after receipt of such communication.
    (d) An executive department or agency official may communicate 
orally with registered lobbyists concerning general Recovery Act policy 
issues; provided, however, that such oral communications shall not 
extend to or touch upon particular projects, applications, or applicants 
for funding, and further that the official must contemporaneously or 
immediately thereafter document in writing: (i) the date and time of the 
contact on policy issues; (ii) the names of the registered lobbyists and 
the official(s) between whom the contact took place; and (iii) a short 
description of the substance of the communication. This writing must be 
posted publicly by the executive department or agency on its recovery 
website within 3 business days of the communication.
    (e) Upon the scheduling of, and again at the outset of, any oral 
communications with any person or entity concerning general Recovery Act 
policy issues, an executive department or agency official shall inquire 
whether any of the individuals or parties appearing or communicating 
concerning such issues is a lobbyist registered under the Lobbying 
Disclosure Act. If so, the official shall comply with paragraph (d) 
above.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) The Director of OMB shall assist and, as 
appropriate, issue guidance to the heads of executive departments and 
agencies to carry out their responsibilities under this memorandum. 
Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of OMB shall 
review the implementation of this memorandum by executive departments 
and agencies and shall forward to me any recommendations for 
modifications or revisions to this memorandum.
    (b) This memorandum does not apply to tax-related provisions in 
Division B of the Recovery Act.
    (c) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect: (i) authority granted by law or Executive Order to an 
executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) functions of 
the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or 
legislative proposals.
    (d) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and all OMB implementing guidance, and shall be subject to the 
availability of appropriations.
    (e) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
Sec. 5. Publication. The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of May 5, 2009

Biofuels and Rural Economic Development

Memorandum for the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Energy, 
[and] the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency
In the Nation's ongoing efforts to achieve energy independence, biomass 
and biofuels promise to play a key role by providing the Nation with 
homegrown sustainable energy options and energizing our economy with new 
industries and jobs. While producing clean renewable fuels locally is a 
powerful engine of economic growth, they must be developed and used in a 
way that limits environmental impact. Today, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, as 
required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, to set new 
national renewable fuel standards and implement those standards. The 
public will have an opportunity to provide input on this proposal 
through a 60-day comment period, and the EPA is conducting peer reviews 
on key aspects of the environmental impact assessments within the 
proposal.
In order to shepherd our Nation's development of this important industry 
and to coordinate interagency policy, I hereby establish a Biofuels 
Interagency Working Group (Working Group), to be co-chaired by the 
Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy and the Administrator of the EPA. 
This Working Group will coordinate with the National Science and 
Technology Council's Biomass Research and Development Board in 
undertaking its work. The responsibilities of the Working Group shall 
include:
    (a) Developing the Nation's first comprehensive biofuel market 
development program, which shall use existing authorities and identify 
new policies to support the development of next-generation biofuels, 
increase flexible fuel vehicle use, and assist in retail marketing 
efforts;
    (b) Coordinating infrastructure policies affecting the supply, 
secure transport, and distribution of biofuels; and
    (c) Identifying new policy options to promote the environmental 
sustainability of biofuels feedstock production, taking into 
consideration land use, habitat conservation, crop management practices, 
water efficiency and water quality, as well as lifecycle assessments of 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Alongside the Working Group's efforts, the Secretary of Agriculture may 
pursue other important biofuel development efforts. The Rural 
Development Act of 1972 and the Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 
direct the Secretary of Agriculture to develop, in coordination with 
State and local governments, a nationwide rural development program to 
assure rural America's health and prosperity. In keeping with that 
mandate, and recognizing the key role rural America will play in the 
development of biofuel technology and development, I request that the 
Secretary of Agriculture take the following steps, to the extent 
permitted by law:
    (a) Immediately begin restructuring existing investments in 
renewable fuels as needed to preserve industry employment; and
    (b) Develop a comprehensive approach to accelerating the investment 
in and production of American biofuels and reducing our dependence on 
fossil fuels by providing, within 30 days, under the authorities made 
available in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008:

(i) Loan guarantees for the development, construction, and retrofitting of 
commercial-scale biorefineries and grants to help pay for the development 
and construction costs of demonstration-scale biorefineries;

(ii) Expedited funding to encourage biorefineries to replace the use of 
fossil fuels in plant operations by installing new biomass energy systems 
or producing new energy from renewable biomass;

(iii) Expedited funding to biofuels producers to encourage production of 
next-generation biofuels from cellulosic biomass and other feedstocks;

(iv) Expansion of the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency 
Improvements Program, which has been renamed the Rural Energy for America 
Program, to include hydroelectric source technologies, energy audits, and 
higher loan guarantee limits; and

 (v) Guidance and support for collection, harvest, storage, and 
transportation assistance for eligible materials for use in biomass 
conversion facilities.

This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Secretary of Agriculture is hereby authorized and directed to 
publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of May 7, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of 
the Government of Syria

On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria 
Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Public 
Law 108-175, the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he 
declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the 
Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive 
Order 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and 
prohibited the exportation or re-exportation of certain goods to Syria. 
On April 25, 2006, and February 13, 2008, the President issued Executive 
Order 13399 and Executive Order 13460, respectively, to take additional 
steps with respect to this national emergency.
The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the 
Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-
existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and 
missile programs, and undermining U.S. and international efforts with 
respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Syria continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures adopted on that date, on 
April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 13399, and on February 13, 2008, in 
Executive Order 13460, to deal with that emergency must continue in 
effect beyond May 11, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) 
of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 
1 year the national emergency declared with respect to certain actions 
of the Government of Syria.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of May 14, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma

On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, certifying 
to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-208), that the Government of Burma has committed large-scale 
repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 
1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
United States persons contained in that section. The President also 
declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions 
and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter 
alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq.
On July 28, 2003, the President issued Executive Order 13310, taking 
additional steps with respect to that national emergency by putting in 
place an import ban required by the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 
2003 and prohibiting exports of financial services to Burma and the 
dealing in property in which certain designated persons have an 
interest. On October 18, 2007, the President issued Executive Order 
13448, expanding the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13047 and taking additional steps to prohibit transactions or dealings 
with certain persons, including the Burmese regime's financial 
supporters and their companies, as well as individuals determined to be 
responsible for or to have participated in human rights abuses or to 
have engaged in activities facilitating public corruption in Burma.
On April 30, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13464, taking 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13047, in order to address the Government of Burma's 
continued repression of the democratic opposition in Burma.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date, July 28, 2003, 
October 18, 2007, and April 30, 2008, to deal with that emergency, must 
continue in effect beyond May 20, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Burma. This 
notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the

Memorandum of May 20, 2009

Preemption

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
From our Nation's founding, the American constitutional order has been a 
Federal system, ensuring a strong role for both the national Government 
and the States. The Federal Government's role in promoting the general 
welfare and guarding individual liberties is critical, but State law and 
national law often operate concurrently to provide independent 
safeguards for the public. Throughout our history, State and local 
governments have frequently protected health, safety, and the 
environment more aggressively than has the national Government.
An understanding of the important role of State governments in our 
Federal system is reflected in longstanding practices by executive 
departments and agencies, which have shown respect for the traditional 
prerogatives of the States. In recent years, however, notwithstanding 
Executive Order 13132 of August 4, 1999 (Federalism), executive 
departments and agencies have sometimes announced that their regulations 
preempt State law, including State common law, without explicit 
preemption by the Congress or an otherwise sufficient basis under 
applicable legal principles.
The purpose of this memorandum is to state the general policy of my 
Administration that preemption of State law by executive departments and 
agencies should be undertaken only with full consideration of the 
legitimate prerogatives of the States and with a sufficient legal basis 
for preemption. Executive departments and agencies should be mindful 
that in our Federal system, the citizens of the several States have 
distinctive circumstances and values, and that in many instances it is 
appropriate for them to apply to themselves rules and principles that 
reflect these circumstances and values. As Justice Brandeis explained 
more than 70 years ago, ``[i]t is one of the happy incidents of the 
federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens 
choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic 
experiments without risk to the rest of the country.''
To ensure that executive departments and agencies include statements of 
preemption in regulations only when such statements have a sufficient 
legal basis:
    1. Heads of departments and agencies should not include in 
regulatory preambles statements that the department or agency intends to 
preempt State law through the regulation except where preemption 
provisions are also included in the codified regulation.
    2. Heads of departments and agencies should not include preemption 
provisions in codified regulations except where such provisions would be 
justified under legal principles governing preemption, including the 
principles outlined in Executive Order 13132.
    3. Heads of departments and agencies should review regulations 
issued within the past 10 years that contain statements in regulatory 
preambles or codified provisions intended by the department or agency to 
preempt State law, in order to decide whether such statements or 
provisions are justified under applicable legal principles governing 
preemption. Where the head of a department or agency determines that a 
regulatory statement of preemption or codified regulatory provision 
cannot be so justified, the head of that department or agency should 
initiate appropriate action, which may include amendment of the relevant 
regulation.
Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of 
this memorandum to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their 
statutory authorities. Heads of departments and agencies should consult 
as necessary with the Attorney General and the Office of Management and 
Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to determine how 
the requirements of this memorandum apply to particular situations.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of May 27, 2009

Classified Information and Controlled Unclassified Information

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
As outlined in my January 21, 2009, memoranda to the heads of executive 
departments and agencies on Transparency and Open Government and on the 
Freedom of Information Act, my Administration is committed to operating 
with an unprecedented level of openness. While the Government must be 
able to prevent the public disclosure of information where such 
disclosure would compromise the privacy of American citizens, national 
security, or other legitimate interests, a democratic government 
accountable to the people must be as transparent as possible and must 
not withhold information for self-serving reasons or simply to avoid 
embarrassment.
To these ends, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. Review of Executive Order 12958. (a) Within 90 days of the 
date of this memorandum, and after consulting with the relevant 
executive departments and agencies (agencies), the Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs shall review Executive Order 
12958, as amended (Classified National Security Information), and submit 
to me recommendations and proposed revisions to the order.
    (b) The recommendations and proposed revisions shall address:

  (i) Establishment of a National Declassification Center to bring 
appropriate agency officials together to perform collaborative 
declassification review under the administration of the Archivist of the 
United States;

  (ii) Effective measures to address the problem of over classification, 
including the possible restoration of the presumption against 
classification, which would preclude classification of information where 
there is significant doubt about the need for such classification, and the 
implementation of increased accountability for classification decisions;

   (iii) Changes needed to facilitate greater sharing of classified 
information among appropriate parties;

  (iv) Appropriate prohibition of reclassification of material that has 
been declassified and released to the public under proper authority;

  (v) Appropriate classification, safeguarding, accessibility, and 
declassification of information in the electronic environment, as 
recommended by the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the 
United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction and others; and

  (vi) Any other measures appropriate to provide for greater openness and 
transparency in the Government's security classification and 
declassification program while also affording necessary protection to the 
Government's legitimate interests.

Sec. 2. Review of Procedures for Controlled Unclassified Information. 
(a) Background. There has been a recognized need in recent years to 
enhance national security by establishing an information sharing 
environment that facilitates the sharing of terrorism-related 
information among government personnel addressing common problems across 
agencies and levels of government. The global nature of the threats 
facing the United States requires that our Nation's entire network of 
defenders be able rapidly to share sensitive but unclassified 
information so that those who must act have the information they need.
To this end, efforts have been made to standardize procedures for 
designating, marking, and handling information that had been known 
collectively as ``Sensitive But Unclassified'' (SBU) information. 
Sensitive But Unclassified refers collectively to the various 
designations used within the Federal Government for documents and 
information that are sufficiently sensitive to warrant some level of 
protection, but that do not meet the standards for national security 
classification. Because each agency has implemented its own protections 
for categorizing and handling SBU, there are more than 107 unique 
markings and over 130 different labeling or handling processes and 
procedures for SBU information.
A Presidential Memorandum of December 16, 2005, created a process for 
establishing a single, standardized, comprehensive designation within 
the executive branch for most SBU information. A related Presidential 
Memorandum of May 9, 2008 (hereafter the ``May 2008 Presidential 
Memorandum''), adopted the phrase ``Controlled Unclassified 
Information'' (CUI) to refer to such information. That memorandum 
adopted, instituted, and defined CUI as the single designation for 
information within the scope of the CUI definition, including terrorism-
related information previously designated SBU. The memorandum also 
established a CUI Framework for designating, marking, safeguarding, and 
disseminating CUI terrorism-related information; designated the National 
Archives and Records Administration as the Executive Agent responsible 
for overseeing and managing implementation of the CUI Framework, and 
created a CUI Council to perform an advisory and coordinating role.
The May 2008 Presidential Memorandum had the salutary effect of 
establishing a framework for standardizing agency-specific approaches to 
designating terrorism-related information that is sensitive but not 
classified. As anticipated, the process of implementing the new CUI 
Framework is still ongoing and is not expected to be completed until 
2013. Moreover, the scope of the May 2008 Presidential Memorandum is 
limited to terrorism-related information within the information sharing 
environment. In the absence of a single, comprehensive framework that is 
fully implemented, the persistence of multiple categories of SBU, 
together with institutional and perceived technological obstacles to 
moving toward an information sharing culture, continue to impede 
collaboration and the otherwise authorized sharing of SBU information 
among agencies, as well as between the Federal Government and its 
partners in State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector.
Agencies and other relevant actors should continue their efforts toward 
implementing the CUI framework. At the same time, new measures should be 
considered to further and expedite agencies' implementation of 
appropriate frameworks for standardized treatment of SBU information and 
information sharing.
    (b) Interagency Task Force on CUI. (i) The Attorney General and the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, the Archivist of the United States, the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, the 
Program Manager, Information Sharing Environment (established in section 
1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, as 
amended (6 U.S.C. 485)), and the CUI Council (established in the May 
2008 Presidential Memorandum), shall lead an Interagency Task Force on 
CUI (Task Force). The Task Force shall be composed of senior 
representatives from a broad range of agencies from both inside and 
outside the information sharing environment.

  (ii) The objective of the Task Force shall be to review current 
procedures for categorizing and sharing SBU information in order to 
determine whether such procedures strike the proper balance among the 
relevant imperatives. These imperatives include protecting legitimate 
security, law enforcement, and privacy interests as well as civil 
liberties, providing clear rules to those who handle SBU information, and 
ensuring that the handling and dissemination of information is not 
restricted unless there is a compelling need. The Task Force shall also 
consider measures to track agencies' progress with implementing the CUI 
Framework, other measures to enhance implementation of an effective 
information sharing environment across agencies and levels of government, 
and whether the scope of the CUI Framework should remain limited to 
terrorism-related information within the information sharing environment or 
be expanded to apply to all SBU information.

  (iii) Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Task Force shall 
submit to me recommendations regarding how the executive branch should 
proceed with respect to the CUI Framework and the information sharing 
environment. The recommendations shall recognize and reflect a balancing of 
the following principles:

        (A) A presumption in favor of openness in accordance with my 
        memoranda of January 21, 2009, on Transparency and Open 
        Government and on the Freedom of Information Act;
         (B) The value of standardizing the procedures for designating, 
        marking, and handling all SBU information; and
        (C) The need to prevent the public disclosure of information 
        where disclosure would compromise privacy or other legitimate 
        interests.
Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) The heads of agencies shall assist and 
provide information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, 
as may be necessary to carry out the functions of their activities under 
this memorandum. Each agency shall bear its own expense for 
participating in the Task Force.
    (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:

  (i) Authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head 
thereof; or

  (ii) Functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
Sec. 4. Publication. The Attorney General is hereby authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of June 12, 2009

National Policy for the Oceans, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The oceans, our coasts, and the Great Lakes provide jobs, food, energy 
resources, ecological services, recreation, and tourism opportunities, 
and play critical roles in our Nation's transportation, economy, and 
trade, as well as the global mobility of our Armed Forces and the 
maintenance of international peace and security. We have a stewardship 
responsibility to maintain healthy, resilient, and sustainable oceans, 
coasts, and Great Lakes resources for the benefit of this and future 
generations.
Yet, the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes are subject to substantial 
pressures and face significant environmental challenges. Challenges 
include water pollution and degraded coastal water quality caused by 
industrial and commercial activities both onshore and offshore, habitat 
loss, fishing impacts, invasive species, disease, rising sea levels, and 
ocean acidification. Oceans both influence and are affected by climate 
change. They not only affect climate processes but they are also under 
stress from the impacts of climate change. Renewable energy, shipping, 
and aquaculture are also expected to place growing demands on ocean and 
Great Lakes resources. These resources therefore require protection 
through the numerous Federal, State, and local authorities with 
responsibility and jurisdiction over the oceans, coasts, and Great 
Lakes.
To succeed in protecting the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes, the United 
States needs to act within a unifying framework under a clear national 
policy, including a comprehensive, ecosystem-based framework for the 
longterm conservation and use of our resources.
In order to better meet our Nation's stewardship responsibilities for 
the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes, there is established an Interagency 
Ocean Policy Task Force (Task Force), to be led by the Chair of the 
Council on Environmental Quality. The Task Force shall be composed of 
senior policy-level officials from the executive departments, agencies, 
and offices represented on the Committee on Ocean Policy established by 
section 3 of Executive Order 13366 of December 17, 2004. This Task Force 
is not meant to duplicate that structure, but rather is intended to be a 
temporary entity with the following responsibilities:
1. Within 90 days from the date of this memorandum, the Task Force shall 
develop recommendations that include:
a. A national policy that ensures the protection, maintenance, and 
restoration of the health of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems 
and resources, enhances the sustainability of ocean and coastal 
economies, preserves our maritime heritage, provides for adaptive 
management to enhance our understanding of and capacity to respond to 
climate change, and is coordinated with our national security and 
foreign policy interests. The recommendations should prioritize 
upholding our stewardship responsibilities and ensuring accountability 
for all of our actions affecting ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes 
resources, and be consistent with international law, including customary 
international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on 
the Law of the Sea.
b. A United States framework for policy coordination of efforts to 
improve stewardship of the oceans, our coasts, and the Great Lakes. The 
Task Force should review the Federal Government's existing policy 
coordination framework to ensure integration and collaboration across 
jurisdictional lines in meeting the objectives of a national policy for 
the oceans, our coasts, and the Great Lakes. This will include 
coordination with the work of the National Security Council and Homeland 
Security Council as they formulate and coordinate policy involving 
national and homeland security, including maritime security. The 
framework should also address specific recommendations to improve 
coordination and collaboration among Federal, State, tribal, and local 
authorities, including regional governance structures.
c. An implementation strategy that identifies and prioritizes a set of 
objectives the United States should pursue to meet the objectives of a 
national policy for the oceans, our coasts, and the Great Lakes.
2. Within 180 days from the date of this memorandum, the Task Force 
shall develop, with appropriate public input, a recommended framework 
for effective coastal and marine spatial planning. This framework should 
be a comprehensive, integrated, ecosystem-based approach that addresses 
conservation, economic activity, user conflict, and sustainable use of 
ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources consistent with international 
law, including customary international law as reflected in the 1982 
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
3. The Task Force shall terminate upon the completion of its duties.
The Task Force's recommendations and frameworks should be cost effective 
and improve coordination across Federal agencies.
This memorandum covers matters involving the oceans, the Great Lakes, 
the coasts of the United States (including its territories and 
possessions), and related seabed, subsoil, and living and non-living 
resources.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. 
Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, regulatory, and 
legislative proposals.
The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality is hereby authorized 
and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of June 12, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions and 
Policies of Certain Members of the Government of Belarus and Other 
Persons that Undermine Democratic Processes or Institutions in Belarus

On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Belarus, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons that have 
undermined democratic processes or institutions; committed human rights 
abuses related to political repression, including detentions and 
disappearances; and engaged in public corruption, including by diverting 
or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority.
Despite some positive developments in the past year, including the 
release of internationally recognized political prisoners, the actions 
and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other 
persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States. Accordingly, 
the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the measures 
adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in 
effect beyond June 16, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13405.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Memorandum of June 17, 2009

Federal Benefits and Non-Discrimination

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Millions of hard-working, dedicated, and patriotic public servants are 
employed by the Federal Government as part of the civilian workforce, 
and many of these devoted Americans have same-sex domestic partners. 
Leading companies in the private sector are free to provide to same-sex 
domestic partners the same benefits they provide to married people of 
the opposite sex. Executive departments and agencies, however, may only 
provide benefits on that basis if they have legal authorization to do 
so. My Administration is not authorized by Federal law to extend a 
number of available Federal benefits to the same-sex partners of Federal 
employees. Within existing law, however, my Administration, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, who oversees our Foreign 
Service employees, and the Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management, who oversees human resource management for our civil service 
employees, has identified areas in which statutory authority exists to 
achieve greater equality for the Federal workforce through extension to 
same-sex domestic partners of benefits currently available to married 
people of the opposite sex. Extending available benefits will help the 
Federal Government compete with the private sector to recruit and retain 
the best and the brightest employees.
I hereby request the following:
Section 1. Extension of Identified Benefits. The Secretary of State and 
the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall, in 
consultation with the Department of Justice, extend the benefits they 
have respectively identified to qualified same-sex domestic partners of 
Federal employees where doing so can be achieved and is consistent with 
Federal law.
Sec. 2. Review of Governmentwide Benefits. The heads of all other 
executive departments and agencies, in consultation with the Office of 
Personnel Management, shall conduct a review of the benefits provided by 
their respective departments and agencies to determine what authority 
they have to extend such benefits to same-sex domestic partners of 
Federal employees. The results of this review shall be reported within 
90 days to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, who, in 
consultation with the Department of Justice, shall recommend to me any 
additional measures that can be taken, consistent with existing law, to 
provide benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of Federal Government 
employees.
Sec. 3. Promoting Compliance with Existing Law Requiring Federal 
Workplaces to be Free of Discrimination Based on Non-Merit Factors. The 
Office of Personnel Management shall issue guidance within 90 days to 
all executive departments and agencies regarding compliance with, and 
implementation of, the civil service laws, rules, and regulations, 
including 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(10), which make it unlawful to discriminate 
against Federal employees or applicants for Federal employment on the 
basis of factors not related to job performance.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be 
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

  (i) Authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head 
thereof; or

  (ii) Functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
Sec. 5. Publication. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management 
is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

Notice of June 18, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Useable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``order'') blocking property and interests in property of the Government 
of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of United States persons that are directly related 
to the implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation 
Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from 
Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related contracts and 
agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU Agreements 
allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived from 
nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial 
purposes. The order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of 
the Russian Federation.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2009, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian 
Federation. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of June 22, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western 
Balkans

On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of 
persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) 
extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the 
Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the 
Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo. The President subsequently amended 
that order in Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003.
Because the actions of persons threatening the peace and international 
stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
the United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and 
the measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that 
emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2009. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the Western Balkans.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register  and transmitted

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea

On June 26, 2008, by Executive Order 13466, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the current existence and risk of the 
proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean 
Peninsula. The President also found that it was necessary to maintain 
certain restrictions with respect to North Korea that would otherwise 
have been lifted pursuant to Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which 
terminated the exercise of authorities under the Trading With the Enemy 
Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) with respect to North Korea.
Because the existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable 
fissile material on the Korean Peninsula continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2008, and the

Notice of July 16, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Former 
Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor

On July 22, 2004, by Executive Order 13348, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures, including the blocking 
of the property of certain persons connected to the former Liberian 
regime of Charles Taylor, pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
former Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in 
particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their 
removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property, which 
have undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly 
development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions 
and resources. The President further noted that the Comprehensive Peace 
Agreement signed on August 18, 2003, and the related cease-fire had not 
yet been universally implemented throughout Liberia, and that the 
illicit trade in round logs and timber products was linked to the 
proliferation of and trafficking in illegal arms, which perpetuated the 
Liberian conflict and fueled and exacerbated other conflicts throughout 
West Africa.
The actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others have left a legacy 
of destruction that continues to undermine Liberia's transformation and 
recovery. Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on July 22, 2004, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond July 22, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order

Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
As outlined in Executive Order 13505 of March 9, 2009, my Administration 
is committed to supporting and conducting ethically responsible, 
scientifically worthy human stem cell research, including human 
embryonic stem cell research, to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant 
to that order, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published final 
``National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Human Stem Cell 
Research'' (Guidelines), effective July 7, 2009. These Guidelines apply 
to the expenditure of NIH funds for research using human embryonic stem 
cells and certain uses of human induced pluripotent stem cells. The 
Guidelines are based on the principles that responsible research with 
human embryonic stem cells has the potential to improve our 
understanding of human biology and aid in the discovery of new ways to 
prevent and treat illness, and that individuals donating embryos for 
research purposes should do so freely, with voluntary and informed 
consent. These Guidelines will ensure that NIH-funded research adheres 
to the highest ethical standards.
In order to ensure that all federally funded human stem cell research is 
conducted according to these same principles and to promote a uniform 
Federal policy across the executive branch, I hereby direct the heads of 
executive departments and agencies that support and conduct stem cell 
research to adopt these Guidelines, to the fullest extent practicable in 
light of legal authorities and obligations. I also direct those 
departments and agencies to submit to the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), within 90 days, proposed additions or 
revisions to any other guidance, policies, or procedures related to 
human stem cell research, consistent with Executive Order 13505 and this 
memorandum. The Director of the OMB shall, in coordination with the 
Director of NIH, review these proposals to ensure consistent 
implementation of Executive Order 13505 and this memorandum.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or

Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of 
Certain Persons To Undermine the Sovereignty of Lebanon or its 
Democratic Processes and Institutions

On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic 
processes or institutions and certain other persons, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The 
President determined that the actions of certain persons to undermine 
Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic 
institutions; to contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of 
law in Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and 
intimidation; to reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian 
interference in Lebanon, or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese 
sovereignty contribute to political and economic instability in that 
country and the region and constitute an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
Despite some positive developments in the past year, including the 
establishment of diplomatic relations and an exchange of ambassadors 
between Syria and Lebanon, the actions of certain persons continue to 
contribute to political and economic instability in Lebanon and continue 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency 
declared on August 1, 2007, and the measures adopted on that date to 
deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond August 1, 2009. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies

Continuation of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of 
Colombia

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Colombia, that (1) 
interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in 
illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary, 
because of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to 
the national security of that country; and (2) that country has 
appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life 
in the air and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which 
shall at a minimum include effective means to identify and warn an 
aircraft before the use of force is directed against the aircraft.

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control Regulations

On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided to the 
President under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the President issued Executive Order 13222. In 
that order, he declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States in light of the expiration of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). 
Because the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the 
Congress, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must 
continue in effect beyond August 17, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order

Presidential Determination No. 2009-28 of September 11, 2009

Imports of Certain Passenger Vehicle and Light Truck Tires From the 
People's Republic of China

Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Labor[, 
and] the United States Trade Representative
On July 9, 2009, the United States International Trade Commission 
(USITC) submitted a report to me that contained a determination pursuant 
to its investigation under section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (the ``Trade Act''), that certain passenger vehicle and light 
truck tires from the People's Republic of China (China) are being 
imported into the United States in such increased quantities or under 
such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to 
the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.
By proclamation I have issued today (the ``proclamation''), and after 
considering all relevant aspects of the investigation, I have proclaimed 
actions of the type described in section 421(a) of the Trade Act. I have 
determined that the most appropriate action is application of an 
additional duty on imports of certain passenger vehicle and light truck 
tires from China, as defined in paragraph 4 of the proclamation. I have 
also determined that such action shall be in effect for a period of 3 
years.
Specifically, I have proclaimed an additional duty on imports of the 
products described in paragraph 4 of the proclamation, which for the 
first year shall be in the amount of 35 percent ad valorem above the 
column 1 general rate of duty. For the second year, the additional duty 
shall be in the amount of 30 percent ad valorem above the column 1 
general rate of duty, and in the third year, the additional duty shall 
be in the amount of 25 percent ad valorem above the column 1 general 
rate of duty.
In order to assist workers, firms, and their communities that have been 
or are affected by the market disruption, I direct the Secretary of 
Commerce and the Secretary of Labor to expedite consideration of any 
Trade Adjustment Assistance applications received from domestic 
passenger vehicle and light truck tire producers, their workers, or 
communities and to provide such other requested assistance or relief as 
they deem appropriate, consistent with their statutory mandates.
The United States Trade Representative is authorized and directed to 
publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 2009-30 of September 15, 2009

Presidential Determination on Major Illicit Drug Transit or Major 
Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2010

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228)(FRAA), I hereby identify the 
following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug 
producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, 
Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, 
Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.
A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse 
reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of 
cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory 
definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth 
in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit 
drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of 
geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit 
or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous 
enforcement measures.
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, 
Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during 
the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under 
international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set 
forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report are 
justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, 
as required by section 706(2)(B).
I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 
706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Venezuela's 
democratic institutions and continued support for bilateral programs in 
Bolivia are vital to the national interests of the United States.
Afghanistan continues to be the world's largest producer of opium poppy 
and a major source of heroin. The Government of Afghanistan, under the 
leadership of President Karzai and key governors in the provinces, has 
demonstrated its ongoing commitment to combating narcotics and has made 
notable improvements in this regard over the past year.
The connection between opium production, the resulting narcotics trade, 
corruption, and the insurgency continues to grow more evident in 
Afghanistan. Poppy cultivation remains largely confined to five 
contiguous provinces in the south where security problems greatly impede 
counternarcotics efforts, and nearly all significant poppy cultivation 
occurs in insecure areas with active insurgent elements. 
Counternarcotics efforts have shown greater impact where security 
exists, where public information messages can be conveyed, alternative 
development delivered, interdiction performed, and justice carried out. 
While the Government of Afghanistan made some progress during the past 
year, the country must dedicate far greater political will and 
programmatic effort to combat opium trafficking and production 
nationwide.
Pakistan is a major transit country for opiates and hashish for markets 
around the world, as well as for precursor chemicals moving into 
neighboring Afghanistan where they are used for processing heroin. Opium 
poppy cultivation in Pakistan is also a primary concern.
In 2008 and 2009, religious extremist groups controlled major portions 
of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where most of Pakistan's 
poppy is grown. These extremist groups also pushed into settled areas of 
the country's Northwest Frontier Province, such as the Peshawar Valley 
and the Swat Valley. The Government of Pakistan was compelled to divert 
manpower and equipment resources from poppy eradication efforts to 
contest these incursions.
The joint Narcotics Affairs Section and Pakistan's Narcotics Control 
Cell indicated that 1,909 hectares of poppy were cultivated in 2008 
(approximately one percent of the cultivation in Afghanistan). This is 
down from the 2,315 hectares cultivated in 2007. In 2007, when the 
insurgent problem was not as widespread, 614 hectares were eradicated, 
bringing harvested poppy down to 1,701 hectares. During 2008, there were 
significant narcotics and precursor chemical seizures in Pakistan. 
United States counternarcotics and border security assistance programs 
continue to build the counternarcotics capacity of law enforcement 
agencies, especially in Baluchistan and along the Makran coast.
As Mexico and Colombia continue to apply pressure on drug traffickers, 
the countries of Central America are increasingly targeted for 
trafficking, which is creating serious challenges for the region. In 
2008, approximately 42 percent of the cocaine destined for the United 
States transited Central America directly from South America. Often 
unimpeded due to the region's limited capabilities and resources, 
traffickers use land routes and Central America's coastal waters for 
illegal drug movements. The Merida Initiative, which provides Central 
American countries $165 million for FY 2008 and FY 2009, offers the 
opportunity to boost the capabilities of the region's rule of law 
institutions and promote greater regional law enforcement cooperation.
Within the Central America region, Guatemala has been listed as a major 
drug transit country since 1990. Guatemala continues to be challenged by 
increasing violence related to narcotics trafficking. Corruption and 
inadequate law enforcement efforts contributed to low interdiction 
levels during the past several years. The United States continues to 
support the Government of Guatemala to improve its counternarcotics 
efforts.
In Honduras, drug traffickers have capitalized on the country's lack of 
resources, corruption, and ungoverned spaces. Despite the current 
political instability, Honduran security forces have been conducting 
counternarcotic operations and have already seized more illegal drugs 
than in all of 2008. Honduras has also agreed to a bilateral integrated 
strategy with the United States to strengthen the operational 
counternarcotics capabilities of its security and law enforcement 
forces.
Panama is a major drug transit country that seized 51 metric tons of 
cocaine in 2008 while working in partnership with the United States. El 
Salvador is not a primary transit country, but in 2008 the Salvadoran 
government seized 1.4 metric tons of cocaine, 300 kilograms of 
marijuana, and nine kilograms of heroin. El Salvador may see an increase 
in drug activity corresponding with rising drug trafficking levels in 
the eastern Pacific. The United States is increasingly concerned with 
the large amount of drugs trafficked through Costa Rica and Nicaragua. 
Interdiction efforts in these two countries in 2008 resulted in the 
seizure of 21.7 and 19.5 metric tons of cocaine seizures, respectively.
The trafficking of South American cocaine through Nigeria and other West 
African countries en route to Europe continues. Though the cocaine does 
not come to the United States, the proceeds of the trafficking flow back 
to the same organizations that move cocaine to the United States, 
reinforcing their financial strength. Drug trafficking is a 
destabilizing force in the region and undermines good governance. 
Initially focused on Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, drug trafficking is now a 
serious issue facing nearly all West African countries. There is limited 
capacity in many West African law enforcement and judicial sectors to 
investigate and prosecute the organizers of cocaine trafficking. Despite 
this, there have been some important counternarcotics victories, most 
notably in the arrest and successful prosecution of traffickers in 
Sierra Leone.
Nigeria, which remains a significant transit point for narcotics 
destined for the United States, made demonstrable progress in 2008 by 
combating narcotics through increased budgetary support of key 
counternarcotics and corruption agencies, continued evaluation of 
suspicious transaction reports, and acceptable progress in the arrests 
of drug kingpins, with one kingpin arrested in 2008 and another in early 
2009. Drug seizures were down slightly from a high in 2007. However, 
this development is likely attributable to a decrease in the use of 
Nigeria's international airports as a transshipment point after the 
successful deployment of narcotics scanning machines by the Nigerian 
Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). At the same time, there was little 
progress in reform to expedite Nigerian extradition procedures, or to 
amend its Money Laundering Act to bring it in line with international 
standards. Cooperation between the NDLEA and U.S. law enforcement 
agencies remains robust.
International donors and organizations are working to assist West 
African governments in their counternarcotics efforts. The United States 
supports these efforts to preserve and protect stability and positive 
growth in this region.
The United States continues to maintain a strong and productive law 
enforcement relationship with Canada. Both countries are making 
significant efforts to disrupt the two-way flow of drugs, bulk currency, 
and other contraband. Canada remains a significant producer of MDMA 
(ecstasy) and high-potency marijuana that is trafficked to the United 
States. While Canada's passage of several additional regulations in 
recent years has reduced the large scale diversion and smuggling of bulk 
precursor chemicals across the border, the increasing diversion of these 
chemicals to the production of methamphetamine within Canada could lead 
to greater methamphetamine availability in the United States. The 
frequent mixing of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs into pills 
that are marketed as MDMA by Canada-based criminal groups poses a 
particularly significant public health risk in the United States. The 
United States Government is appreciative of Canada's efforts to address 
these and other drug-related challenges, including through bilateral 
initiatives and multilateral forums.
The Government of India maintains a credible record of regulating its 
licit opium grown for the production of pharmaceutical products through 
licensed opium farmers and monitoring of poppy cultivation sites. 
Diversion of licit opium crops into illegal markets continues despite 
India's determined efforts to control such activity. Illicit opium poppy 
production has also been observed in certain areas of the country, such 
as West Bengal and the State of Uttaranchal. Enforcement agencies 
continue to eradicate illicit opium poppy crops although the actual 
number of hectares destroyed has declined in recent years. Indian 
authorities have made marked efforts to control the illicit drug trade 
as opium and heroin smuggled from Afghanistan and Pakistan enters India 
across the India-Pakistan border and is trafficked to destinations 
outside of India.
Indian authorities continue to pursue precursor chemical trafficking 
organizations operating in the country and to cooperate with 
international law enforcement counterparts to interdict the flow of 
narcotics. The Government of India has made noteworthy international 
efforts to target the misuse of internet pharmacies for trafficking 
controlled and non-controlled pharmaceuticals. Law enforcement 
undertakings in this area have resulted in numerous arrests and asset 
seizures in both the United States and India.
You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under 
section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in

Memorandum of September 17, 2009

Demonstration Grants for the Development, Implementation, and Evaluation 
of Alternatives to the Current Medical Liability System

Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services
As part of my Administration's ongoing effort to reform our health care 
system, we have reached out to members of both political parties and 
listened to the concerns many have raised about the need to improve 
patient safety and to reform our medical liability system. Between 
44,000 and 98,000 patients die each year from medical errors. Many 
physicians continue to struggle to pay their medical malpractice 
premiums, which vary tremendously by specialty and by State. The cost of 
insurance continues to be one of the highest practice expenses for some 
specialties. And although malpractice premiums do not account for a 
large percentage of total medical costs, many physicians report that 
fear of lawsuits leads them to practice defensive medicine, which may 
contribute to higher costs.
We should explore medical liability reform as one way to improve the 
quality of care and patient-safety practices and to reduce defensive 
medicine. But whatever steps we pursue, medical liability reform must be 
just one part of broader health insurance reform--reform that offers 
more security and stability to Americans who have insurance, offers 
insurance to Americans who lack coverage, and slows the growth of health 
care costs for families, businesses, and government.
In recent years, there have been calls from organizations like The Joint 
Commission and the Institute of Medicine to begin funding demonstration 
projects that can test a variety of medical liability models and 
determine which reforms work. These groups and others have identified 
several important goals and core commitments of malpractice reform that 
should serve as a starting point for such projects. We must put patient 
safety first and work to reduce preventable injuries. We must foster 
better communication between doctors and their patients. We must ensure 
that patients are compensated in a fair and timely manner for medical 
injuries, while also reducing the incidence of frivolous lawsuits. And 
we must work to reduce liability premiums.
In 1999, the Congress authorized the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality, which is located within the Department of Health and Human 
Services, to support demonstration projects and to evaluate the 
effectiveness of projects regarding all aspects of health care, 
including medical liability. I hereby request that you announce, within 
30 days of this memorandum, that the Department will make available 
demonstration grants to States, localities, and health systems for the 
development, implementation, and evaluation of alternatives to our 
current medical liability system, consistent with the goals and core 
commitments outlined above.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the 
Federal Register.

Notice of September 21, 2009

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Persons Who 
Commit, Threaten to Commit, or Support Terrorism

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, the President declared 
a national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to 
commit, or support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted 
by the grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by 
foreign terrorists, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 
2001, in New York and Pennsylvania and against the Pentagon, and the 
continuing and immediate threat of further attacks against United States 
nationals or the United States. Because the actions of persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States, the national 
emergency declared on September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on 
that date to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond 
September 23, 2009. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to 
commit, or support terrorism.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

determine that assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for

the United States and designate such persons for this purpose.
Consistent with section 101(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C.1101(a)(42)), and 
after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I also specify that, 
for FY 2010, the following persons may, if otherwise qualified, be 
considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the United States 
within their countries of nationality or habitual residence:
    a. Persons in Cuba
    b. Persons in the former Soviet Union

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and

economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant 
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, and the extreme level of 
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States

Memorandum of November 5, 2009

Tribal Consultation

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The United States has a unique legal and political relationship with 
Indian tribal governments, established through and confirmed by the 
Constitution of the United States, treaties, statutes, executive orders, 
and judicial decisions. In recognition of that special relationship, 
pursuant to Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, executive 
departments and agencies (agencies) are charged with engaging in regular 
and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in 
the development of Federal policies that have tribal implications, and 
are responsible for strengthening the government-to-government 
relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.
History has shown that failure to include the voices of tribal officials 
in formulating policy affecting their communities has all too often led 
to undesirable and, at times, devastating and tragic results. By 
contrast, meaningful dialogue between Federal officials and tribal 
officials has greatly improved Federal policy toward Indian tribes. 
Consultation is a critical ingredient of a sound and productive Federal-
tribal relationship.
My Administration is committed to regular and meaningful consultation 
and collaboration with tribal officials in policy decisions that have 
tribal implications including, as an initial step, through complete and 
consistent implementation of Executive Order 13175. Accordingly, I 
hereby direct each agency head to submit to the Director of the Office 
of Management and Budget (OMB), within 90 days after the date of this 
memorandum, a detailed plan of actions the agency will take to implement 
the policies and directives of Executive Order 13175. This plan shall be 
developed after consultation by the agency with Indian tribes and tribal 
officials as defined in Executive Order 13175. I also direct each agency 
head to submit to the Director of the OMB, within 270 days after the 
date of this memorandum, and annually thereafter, a progress report on 
the status of each action included in its plan together with any 
proposed updates to its plan.
Each agency's plan and subsequent reports shall designate an appropriate 
official to coordinate implementation of the plan and preparation of 
progress reports required by this memorandum. The Assistant to the 
President for Domestic Policy and the Director of the OMB shall review 
agency plans and subsequent reports for consistency with the policies 
and directives of Executive Order 13175.
In addition, the Director of the OMB, in coordination with the Assistant 
to the President for Domestic Policy, shall submit to me, within 1 year 
from the date of this memorandum, a report on the implementation of 
Executive Order 13175 across the executive branch based on the review of 
agency plans and progress reports. Recommendations for improving the 
plans and making the tribal consultation process more effective, if any, 
should be included in this report.
The terms ``Indian tribe,'' ``tribal officials,'' and ``policies that 
have tribal implications'' as used in this memorandum are as defined in 
Executive Order 13175.
The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish 
this memorandum in the Federal Register.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. 
Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of 
this memorandum to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their 
statutory and regulatory authorities and their enforcement mechanisms.

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to Weapons of Mass Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such 
weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13094 
amending Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the 
worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation 
activities. On June 28, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13382 
that, inter alia, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our 
ability to combat proliferation. The proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States; therefore, the national 
emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, and extended in each 
subsequent year, must continue. In accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended.

Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in 
Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, 
and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with 
Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2009. Therefore,

Memorandum of December 9, 2009

Medicare Demonstration To Test Medical Homes in Federally Qualified 
Health Centers

Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services
My Administration is committed to building a high-quality, efficient 
health care system and improving access to health care for all 
Americans. Health centers are a vital part of the health care delivery 
system. For more than 40 years, health centers have served populations 
with limited access to health care, treating all patients regardless of 
ability to pay. These include low-income populations, the uninsured, 
individuals with limited English proficiency, migrant and seasonal farm 
workers, individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and 
individuals living in public housing. There are over 1,100 health 
centers across the country, delivering care at over 7,500 sites. These 
centers served more than 17 million patients in 2008 and are estimated 
to serve more than 20 million patients in 2010.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) 
provided $2 billion for health centers, including $500 million to expand 
health centers' services to over 2 million new patients by opening new 
health center sites, adding new providers, and improving hours of 
operations. An additional $1.5 billion is supporting much-needed capital 
improvements, including funding to buy equipment, modernize clinic 
facilities, expand into new facilities, and adopt or expand the use of 
health information technology and electronic health records.
One of the key benefits health centers provide to the communities they 
serve is quality primary health care services. Health centers use 
interdisciplinary teams to treat the ``whole patient'' and focus on 
chronic disease management to reduce the use of costlier providers of 
care, such as emergency rooms and hospitals.
Federally qualified health centers provide an excellent environment to 
demonstrate the further improvements to health care that may be offered 
by the medical homes approach. In general, this approach emphasizes the 
patient's relationship with a primary care provider who coordinates the 
patient's care and serves as the patient's principal point of contact 
for care. The medical homes approach also emphasizes activities related 
to quality improvement, access to care, communication with patients, and 
care management and coordination. These activities are expected to 
improve the quality and efficiency of care and to help avoid preventable 
emergency and inpatient hospital care. Demonstration programs 
establishing the medical homes approach have been recommended by the 
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent advisory body to

Memorandum of December 15, 2009

Directing Certain Actions With Respect to Acquisition and Use of Thomson 
Correctional Center To Facilitate Closure of Detention Facilities at 
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense [and] the Attorney General
By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief of 
the Armed Forces of the United States by the Constitution and the laws 
of the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of 
Military Force (Public Law 107-40, 115 Stat. 224), and in order to 
facilitate the closure of detention facilities at the Guantanamo Bay 
Naval Base, I hereby direct that the following actions be taken as 
expeditiously as possible with respect to the facility known as the 
Thomson Correctional Center (TCC) in Thomson, Illinois:
1. The Attorney General shall acquire and activate the TCC as a United 
States Penitentiary, which the Attorney General has determined would 
reduce the Bureau of Prisons' shortage of high security, maximum custody 
cell space and could be used for other appropriate inmate or detainee 
management purposes. The Attorney General shall also provide to the 
Department of Defense a sufficient portion of the TCC to serve as a 
detention facility to be operated by the Department of Defense in order 
to accommodate the relocation of detainees by the Secretary of Defense 
in accordance with paragraph 2 of this memorandum.
2. The Secretary of Defense, working in consultation with the Attorney 
General, shall prepare the TCC for secure housing of detainees currently 
held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base who have been or will be 
designated for relocation, and shall relocate such detainees to the TCC, 
consistent with laws related to Guantanamo detainees and the findings 
in, and interagency Review established by, Executive Order 13492 of 
January 22, 2009.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Secretary of Defense is authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of December 29, 2009

Implementation of the Executive Order, ``Classified National Security 
Information''

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Today I have signed an executive order entitled, ``Classified National 
Security Information'' (the ``order''), which substantially advances my 
goals for reforming the security classification and declassification 
processes. I expect that the order will produce measurable progress 
towards greater openness and transparency in the Government's 
classification and declassification programs while protecting the 
Government's legitimate interests, and I will closely monitor the 
results. I also look forward to reviewing recommendations from the study 
that the National Security Advisor will undertake in cooperation with 
the Public Interest Declassification Board to design a more fundamental 
transformation of the security classification system. To further assist 
in fulfilling the goal of measurable progress toward greater openness 
and transparency, I hereby direct the following actions.
1. Initial Implementation Efforts.
Successful implementation of the order requires personal commitment from 
the heads of departments and agencies, as well as their senior 
officials. It also requires effective security education and training 
programs, self-inspection programs, and measures designed to hold 
personnel accountable.
In accordance with section 5.4 of the order, the head of each department 
and agency that creates or handles classified information shall provide 
the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) a copy 
of the department or agency regulations implementing the requirements of 
the order. Such regulations shall be issued in final form within 180 
days of ISOO's publication of its implementing directive for the order. 
The Director of ISOO shall consider agency actions to implement the 
requirements of section 5.4 of the order as a key element in planning 
oversight of agencies. Each senior agency official designated under 
section 5.4(d) of the order shall provide ISOO with updates concerning 
agency plans and other actions to implement the requirements of the 
order. The Director of ISOO shall publish a periodic status report on 
agency implementation.
2. Declassification of Records of Permanent Historical Value.
Under the direction of the National Declassification Center (NDC), and 
utilizing recommendations of an ongoing Business Process Review in 
support of the NDC, referrals and quality assurance problems within a 
backlog of more than 400 million pages of accessioned Federal records 
previously subject to automatic declassification shall be addressed in a 
manner that will permit public access to all declassified records from 
this backlog no later than December 31, 2013. In order to promote the 
efficient and effective utilization of finite resources available for 
declassification, further referrals of these records are not required 
except for those containing information that would clearly and 
demonstrably reveal: (a) the identity of a confidential human source or 
a human intelligence source; or (b) key design concepts of weapons of 
mass destruction.
The Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, and the Director of 
National Intelligence shall provide the Archivist of the United States 
with sufficient guidance to complete this task. The Archivist shall make 
public a report on the status of the backlog every 6 months.
3. Delegation of Original Classification Authority.
Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to the 
minimum necessary to implement the order and only those individuals or 
positions with a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise such 
authority shall be delegated original classification authority.
Accordingly, heads of departments and agencies with original 
classification authority shall commence a review to ensure that all 
delegations of original classification authority are so limited and 
otherwise in accordance with section 1.3(c) of the order. Each 
department and agency shall submit a report on the results of this 
review to the Director of ISOO within 120 days of the date of this 
memorandum.
4. Promotion of New Technologies to Support Declassification.
Striking the critical balance between openness and secrecy is a 
difficult but necessary part of our democratic form of government. 
Striking this balance becomes more difficult as the volume and 
complexity of the information increases. Improving the capability of 
departments and agencies to identify still-sensitive information and to 
make declassified information available to the public are integral parts 
of the classification system.
Therefore, I am directing that the Secretary of Defense and the Director 
of National Intelligence each support research to assist the NDC in 
addressing the cross-agency challenges associated with declassification.
5. Publication. The Archivist of the United States is authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

an exceptional need to classify information originated by their agency, 
the matter shall be referred to the agency head with appropriate subject 
matter interest and classification authority in accordance with section 
1.3(e) of the Executive Order. If the agency with appropriate subject 
matter interest and classification authority cannot readily be 
determined, the matter shall be referred to the Director of the 
Information Security Oversight Office.
Presidential designations ordered prior to the issuance of the Executive 
Order are revoked as of the date of this order. However, delegations of 
authority to classify information originally that were made in 
accordance with the provisions of section 1.4 of Executive Order 12958 
of April 17, 1995, as amended, by officials designated under this order 
shall continue in effect, provided that the authority of such officials 
is delegable under this order.
This order shall be published in the Federal Register.

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec.  102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons forreaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec.  102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec.  102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


Sec.  102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.


Sec. Sec.  102.152-102.159  [Reserved]


Sec.  102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec.  102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.


Sec. Sec.  102.161-102.169  [Reserved]


Sec.  102.170  Compliance procedures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this 
section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 791).
    (c) The Director, Facilities Management, Office of Administration, 
Executive Office of the President, shall be responsible for coordinating 
implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to the Director 
at the following address: Room 486, Old Executive Office Building, 17th 
and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec.  102.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for 
making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.
