                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2013), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vii]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE

    Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of 
the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. 
Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date 
in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected 
(LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to 
the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult 
previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 
2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published 
for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.

[[Page viii]]

    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this 
volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2012 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2012 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 8773 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2012 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2013, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
  statements, can be found in the Compilation of Presidential Documents 
   and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. A selection of these 
Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
Division under the supervision of Laurice A. Clark. The Chief Editor for 
                                 the 2012 Compilation was Lois M. Davis.

Proclamation 8773 of January 13, 2012

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On a hot summer day nearly half a century ago, an African American 
preacher with no official title or rank gave voice to our Nation's 
deepest aspirations, sharing his dream of an America that ensured the 
true equality of all our people. From the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, 
the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. inspired a movement that would 
push our country toward a more perfect Union.
At a time when our Nation was sharply divided, Dr. King called on a 
generation of Americans to be ``voices of reason, sanity, and 
understanding amid the voices of violence, hatred, and emotion.'' His 
example stirred men and women of all backgrounds to become foot soldiers 
for justice, and his leadership gave them the courage to refuse the 
limitations of the day and fight for the prospect of tomorrow. Because 
these individuals showed the resilience to stand firm in the face of the 
fiercest resistance, we are the benefactors of an extraordinary legacy 
of progress.
Today, Dr. King is memorialized on the National Mall where he once 
spoke, a symbol of how far our Nation has come and a testament to the 
quiet heroes whose names may never appear in history books, but whose 
selflessness brought about change few thought possible. Dr. King's 
memorial reminds us that while the work of realizing his remarkable 
dream is unending, with persistence, progress is within our reach.
On the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, we celebrate the man 
who fought for the America he knew was possible. Dr. King's faith in a 
God who loves all His children and a Nation grounded in the promise of 
equality

[[Page 2]]

would not let him rest until victory was won. As we work to meet the 
challenges of our time--from fixing our schools so every child gets a 
world-class education to ensuring all Americans have access to strong 
and secure economic opportunity--let us draw strength from Dr. King's 
stirring affirmation that ``Everybody can be great because everybody can 
serve.'' In his memory, let us continue climbing toward that Promised 
Land, one more fair and more just for all people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2012, as 
the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans 
to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service 
projects in honor of Dr. King, and to visit www.MLKDay.gov to find 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8774 of January 13, 2012

Religious Freedom Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For nearly four centuries, men and women have immigrated to America's 
shores in pursuit of religious freedom. Hailing from diverse backgrounds 
and faiths, countless settlers have shared a simple aspiration--to 
practice their beliefs free from prejudice and persecution. In 1786, the 
Virginia General Assembly took a bold step toward preserving this 
fundamental liberty by passing the Virginia Statute for Religious 
Freedom, which brought to life the ideal of religious tolerance from the 
texts of the Enlightenment in the laws of state. On Religious Freedom 
Day, we celebrate this historic milestone, reflect upon the Statute's 
declaration that ``Almighty God hath created the mind free,'' and 
reaffirm that the American people will remain forever unshackled in 
matters of faith.
Drafted by Thomas Jefferson, the Virginia Statute formed the basis for 
the First Amendment, which has preserved religious freedom for both 
believers and non-believers for over 220 years. As our Nation has grown, 
so too has its diversity of faiths, cultures, and traditions; today, 
individuals of rich and varied beliefs call America home and seek to 
follow their consciences in peace. Our long history of religious 
tolerance and pluralism has strengthened our country, helped create a 
vibrant civil society, and remained true to the principles enshrined in 
our founding documents.
Our Nation is committed to religious liberty not only for all Americans, 
but also for individuals around the world. Internationally, we bear 
witness to those who live in fear of violence and discrimination because 
of their beliefs. My Administration continues to stand with all who are 
denied the

[[Page 3]]

ability to choose, express, or live their faith freely, and we remain 
dedicated to protecting this universal human right and the vital role it 
plays in ensuring peace and stability for all nations.
Today, as we reflect on the many ways religious freedom enriches our 
country and our lives, let us lend our voice to all people striving to 
exercise their innate right to a free mind.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2012, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to commemorate this day 
with events and activities that teach us about this critical foundation 
of our Nation's liberty, and show us how we can protect it for future 
generations at home and around the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8775 of January 31, 2012

American Heart Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every year, heart disease takes the lives of over half a million 
Americans, and it remains the leading cause of death in the United 
States. This devastating epidemic leaves no one untouched; its victims 
are fathers and daughters, grandparents and siblings, cherished friends 
and community members across our country. This month, we remember the 
steps each of us can take to reduce the risk of heart disease and 
recommit to better heart health for all Americans.
While genetic or hereditary factors play a part in many instances of 
cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical 
inactivity, obesity, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse are major risk 
factors that can be prevented or controlled. To take action against 
heart disease, I encourage all Americans to make balanced and nutritious 
meal choices, maintain a healthy weight, and get active. Avoiding 
tobacco, moderating alcohol consumption, and working with a health care 
provider can also help prevent or treat conditions that can lead to 
heart disease. Additional resources on how to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular disease are available at: www.CDC.gov/HeartDisease.
To help win the fight against heart disease, my Administration is 
working to ensure individuals and communities have the tools they need 
to make real gains in this critical effort. Last September, we launched 
the Million Hearts initiative, which is coordinating programs across 
Federal agencies and forging new public-private partnerships to prevent 
one million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years. Resources 
on how to join the initiative are available at: MillionHearts.HHS.gov. 
To secure our children's

[[Page 4]]

heart health and end childhood obesity within a generation, First Lady 
Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative is encouraging healthy eating 
habits and promoting physical activity among families and young people. 
The National Institutes of Health is pursuing cutting-edge research to 
unlock new treatments for cardiovascular disease. And the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention is working in communities across our 
country to help reduce risk factors and prevent heart disease.
During American Heart Month, we also highlight The Heart Truth, a 
national awareness campaign that urges women of all ages to know their 
risk for heart disease. In recognition of this vital task, I encourage 
men and women across America to observe National Wear Red Day on Friday, 
February 3, and to show their support by wearing red or the campaign's 
Red Dress Pin. To learn more about The Heart Truth or National Wear Red 
Day, visit: www.HeartTruth.gov.
In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has 
requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating 
February as ``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2012 as American Heart Month, and I 
invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 
3, 2012. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and 
reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8776 of January 31, 2012

National African American History Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The story of African Americans is a story of resilience and 
perseverance. It traces a people who refused to accept the circumstances 
under which they arrived on these shores, and it chronicles the 
generations who fought for an America that truly reflects the ideals 
enshrined in our founding documents. It is the narrative of slaves who 
shepherded others along the path to freedom and preachers who organized 
against the rules of Jim Crow, of young people who sat-in at lunch 
counters and ordinary men and women who took extraordinary risks to 
change our Nation for the better. During National African American 
History Month, we celebrate the rich legacy of African Americans and 
honor the remarkable contributions they have made to perfecting our 
Union.

[[Page 5]]

This year's theme, ``Black Women in American Culture and History,'' 
invites us to pay special tribute to the role African American women 
have played in shaping the character of our Nation--often in the face of 
both racial and gender discrimination. As courageous visionaries who led 
the fight to end slavery and tenacious activists who fought to expand 
basic civil rights to all Americans, African American women have long 
served as champions of social and political change. And from the 
literary giants who gave voice to their communities to the artists whose 
harmonies and brush strokes captured hardships and aspirations, African 
American women have forever enriched our cultural heritage. Today, we 
stand on the shoulders of countless African American women who shattered 
glass ceilings and advanced our common goals. In recognition of their 
legacy, let us honor their heroic and historic acts for years to come.
The achievements of African American women are not limited to those 
recorded and retold in our history books. Their impact is felt in 
communities where they are quiet heroes who care for their families, in 
boardrooms where they are leaders of industry, in laboratories where 
they are discovering new technologies, and in classrooms where they are 
preparing the next generation for the world they will inherit. As we 
celebrate the successes of African American women, we recall that 
progress did not come easily, and that our work to widen the circle of 
opportunity for all Americans is not complete. With eyes cast toward new 
horizons, we must press on in pursuit of a high-quality education for 
every child, a job for every American who wants one, and a fair chance 
at prosperity for every individual and family across our Nation.
During National African American History Month, we pay tribute to the 
contributions of past generations and reaffirm our commitment to keeping 
the American dream alive for the next generation. In honor of those 
women and men who paved the way for us, and with great expectations for 
those to follow, let us continue the righteous cause of making America 
what it should be--a Nation that is more just and more equal for all its 
people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2012 as 
National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8777 of January 31, 2012

National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In America, an alarming number of young people experience physical, 
sexual, or emotional abuse as part of a controlling or violent dating 
relationship. The consequences of dating violence--spanning impaired 
development to physical harm--pose a threat to the health and well-being 
of teens across our Nation, and it is essential we come together to 
break the cycle of violence that burdens too many of our sons and 
daughters. This month, we recommit to providing critical support and 
services for victims of dating violence and empowering teens with the 
tools to cultivate healthy, respectful relationships.
Though we have made substantial progress in the fight to reduce violence 
against women, dating violence remains a reality for millions of young 
people. In a 12 month period, one in 10 high school students nationwide 
reported they were physically hurt on purpose by their boyfriend or 
girlfriend, and still more experienced verbal or emotional abuse like 
shaming, bullying, or threats. Depression, substance abuse, and health 
complications are among the long-term impacts that may follow in the 
wake of an abusive relationship. Tragically, dating violence can also 
lead to other forms of violence, including sexual assault. These 
outcomes are unacceptable, and we must do more to prevent dating 
violence and ensure the health and safety of our Nation's youth.
The path toward a future free of dating violence begins with awareness. 
As part of my Administration's ongoing commitment to engaging 
individuals and communities in this important work, Vice President Joe 
Biden launched the 1is2many initiative last September. In concert with 
awareness programs occurring across Federal agencies, the initiative 
calls on young men and women to take action against dating violence and 
sexual assault and help advance public understanding of the realities of 
abuse. The National Dating Abuse Helpline offers information and support 
to individuals struggling with unhealthy relationships. For immediate 
and confidential advice and referrals, I encourage concerned teens and 
their loved ones to contact the Helpline at 1-866-331-9474, text 
``loveis'' to 77054, or visit: www.LoveIsRespect.org. Additional 
resources are available at: www.CDC.gov/features/datingviolence.
My Administration continues to promote new and proven strategies to 
target teen dating violence. Last November, we announced the winners of 
the Apps Against Abuse technology challenge, concluding a national 
competition to develop innovative new tools that will empower young 
Americans and help prevent dating violence and sexual assault. As we 
move forward, we will continue to collaborate with both public and 
private partners to bring new violence prevention strategies to 
individuals and communities across our Nation. To learn more, visit: 
www.WhiteHouse.gov/1is2many.
Reducing violence against teens and young adults is an important task 
for all of us. This month, we renew our commitment to breaking the 
silence

[[Page 7]]

about dating abuse and fostering a culture of respect in our 
neighborhoods, our schools, and our homes.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2012 as 
National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call 
upon all Americans to support efforts in their communities and schools, 
and in their own families, to empower young people to develop healthy 
relationships throughout their lives and to engage in activities that 
prevent and respond to teen dating violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8778 of March 1, 2012

American Red Cross Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

After more than 130 years of providing humanitarian relief at home and 
abroad, the American Red Cross remains a reflection of the compassion 
and generosity central to our national identity. At moments of profound 
need, the actions of men and women across our country reflect our 
noblest ideals of service--from search-and-rescue teams that brave 
disaster zones to ordinary citizens who deliver not only lifesaving care 
and supplies, but also hope for a brighter tomorrow. During American Red 
Cross Month, we pay tribute to all those whose dedication to relieving 
human suffering illuminates even our darkest hours.
A visionary humanitarian and unyielding advocate for those in need, 
Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross in 1881 after many years of 
tending to soldiers and families injured in war's wake. In the 
generations that followed, the American Red Cross served as a force for 
peace and recovery during times of crisis. Presidents of the United 
States have called upon the American Red Cross time and again, beginning 
when President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed Red Cross Week during the First 
World War, and continuing into the 21st century.
Today, emergency response organizations like the American Red Cross 
continue to play a vital role in responding to disasters that cast 
countless lives and communities into harm's way. When devastating storms 
struck cities spanning the Midwest to the Eastern Seaboard this past 
year, the American Red Cross and other relief organizations were 
instrumental partners in preparedness, response, and recovery. And when 
a devastating earthquake shook Japan's Pacific coast, they answered by 
extending support to the people of Japan and standing with them as they 
rebuild.
We are reminded in times like these that the strength of our 
humanitarian response and the measure of our resilience are drawn not 
only from the

[[Page 8]]

committed action of relief organizations, but also from individuals who 
step forward, volunteer, or give what they can to help their neighbors 
in need. With generous spirits and can-do attitudes, Americans from 
every corner of our country have come together again and again to show 
the true character of our Nation. As we celebrate American Red Cross 
Month, let us resolve to preserve and renew that humanitarian impulse to 
save, to serve, and to build, and carry it forward in the year to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States, do hereby proclaim March 2012 as American Red Cross 
Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities, and by supporting the work of 
service and relief organizations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8779 of March 1, 2012

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For centuries, America and Ireland have built a proud and enduring 
partnership cemented by mutual values and a common history. Generations 
of Irish have crossed the Atlantic in pursuit of prosperity, and today 
nearly 40 million of their proud descendants continue to make their 
indelible mark on the United States of America. Their stories, as varied 
as our Nation's people, humble us and inspire our children to reach for 
the opportunities dreamed about by our forebears.
Over hundreds of years, Irish men, women, and children left the homes of 
their ancestors, watching the coasts of Donegal and the cliffs of Dingle 
fade behind them. Boarding overcrowded ships and navigating dangerous 
seas, these resilient travelers looked to the horizon with hope in their 
hearts. Many left any valuables, land, or stability they had behind, but 
they came instead with the true treasures of their homeland--song and 
literature, humor and tradition, faith and family. And when they landed 
on our shores, they shared their gifts generously, adding immeasurable 
value to towns, cities, and communities throughout our Nation.
Today, we draw on the indomitable spirit of those Irish Americans whose 
strength helped build countless miles of canals and railroads; whose 
brogues echoed in mills, police stations, and fire halls across our 
country; and whose blood spilled to defend a Nation and a way of life 
they helped define. Defying famine, poverty, and discrimination, these 
sons and daughters of Erin demonstrated extraordinary strength and 
unshakable faith as they gave their all to help build an America worthy 
of the journey they and

[[Page 9]]

so many others have taken. During Irish-American Heritage Month, we 
recall their legacy of hard work and perseverance, and we carry forward 
that singular dedication to forging a more prosperous future for all 
Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2012 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by celebrating the contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8780 of March 1, 2012

Women's History Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, ours is a legacy of bold independence and passionate 
belief in fairness and justice for all. For generations, this intrepid 
spirit has driven women pioneers to challenge injustices and shatter 
ceilings in pursuit of full and enduring equality. During Women's 
History Month, we commemorate their struggles, celebrate centuries of 
progress, and reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the rights, security, 
and dignity of women in America and around the world.
We see the arc of the American story in the dynamic women who shaped our 
present and the groundbreaking girls who will steer our future. Fifty-
one years ago, when former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt confronted 
President John F. Kennedy about the lack of women in government, he 
appointed her the head of a commission to address the status of women in 
America and the discrimination they routinely faced. Though the former 
First Lady passed away before the commission finished its work, its 
report would spur action across our country and galvanize a movement 
toward true gender parity. Our Nation stands stronger for that righteous 
struggle, and last March my Administration was proud to release the 
first comprehensive Federal report on the status of American women since 
President Kennedy's commission in 1963. Today, women serve as leaders 
throughout industry, civil society, and government, and their 
outstanding achievements affirm to our daughters and sons that no dream 
is beyond their reach.
While we have made great strides toward equality, we cannot rest until 
our mothers, sisters, and daughters assume their rightful place as full 
participants in a secure, prosperous, and just society. With the 
leadership of the White House Council on Women and Girls, my 
Administration is advancing gender equality by promoting workplace 
flexibility, striving to bring more women into math and science 
professions, and fighting for equal pay for equal work. We are combating 
violence against women by revising an

[[Page 10]]

antiquated definition of rape and harnessing the latest technology to 
prevent dating violence, domestic violence, and sexual assault. From 
securing women's health and safety to leveling the playing field and 
ensuring women have full and fair access to opportunity in the 21st 
century, we are making deep and lasting investments in the future of all 
Americans.
Because the peace and security of nations around the globe depend upon 
the education and advancement of women and girls, my Administration has 
placed their perspectives and needs at the heart of our foreign policy. 
Last December, I released the first United States National Action Plan 
on Women, Peace, and Security to help ensure women play an equal role in 
peace-building worldwide. By fully integrating women's voices into peace 
processes and our work to prevent conflict, protect civilians, and 
deliver humanitarian assistance, the United States is bringing effective 
support to women in areas of conflict and improving the chances for 
lasting peace. In the months ahead, my Administration will continue to 
collaborate with domestic and international partners on new initiatives 
to bring economic and political opportunity to women at home and abroad.
During Women's History Month, we recall that the pioneering legacy of 
our grandmothers and great-grandmothers is revealed not only in our 
museums and history books, but also in the fierce determination and 
limitless potential of our daughters and granddaughters. As we make 
headway on the crucial issues of our time, let the courageous vision 
championed by women of past generations inspire us to defend the dreams 
and opportunities of those to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2012 as Women's 
History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month and to 
celebrate International Women's Day on March 8, 2012, with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the history, 
accomplishments, and contributions of American women. I also invite all 
Americans to visit www.WomensHistoryMonth.gov to learn more about the 
generations of women who have shaped our history.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Read Across America Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From infancy through adulthood, reading enriches the human experience 
and illuminates the path to learning, opportunity, and success. By 
sharing the beauty and power of books with our children, we make a vital 
investment not only in their future, but also in an America that leads 
the world

[[Page 11]]

in educating its people. As we celebrate Read Across America Day in our 
homes, schools, and libraries, let us recommit to empowering every child 
with a strong start and a passion for the written word.
The journey to literacy begins early and continues throughout childhood. 
Parents and caregivers can play an essential role in developing 
fundamental skills by reading aloud regularly, helping children explore 
new words and concepts, and instilling enthusiasm for language and 
storytelling. These first lessons help pave the way for a love of 
reading that can last a lifetime. As children move from the living room 
to the classroom, teachers, librarians, and families use books to 
reinforce reading proficiency and build critical thinking skills that 
provide the foundation for a world-class education. By working together 
to give our sons and daughters the tools for achievement, we lay the 
groundwork for growth and prosperity that will stand the test of time.
On Read Across America Day, we also celebrate the birthday of Theodor 
Seuss Geisel--an author whose fanciful wordplay and whimsical tales 
continue to delight young readers around the world. Dr. Seuss's stories 
evoke the unlimited potential for imagination and inspiration on the 
printed page, and they remind us of the countless ways reading enhances 
our lives. Today, we reaffirm our commitment to raising a generation of 
avid learners and bringing an outstanding education within reach for 
every child.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2, 2012, as Read 
Across America Day. I call upon children, families, educators, 
librarians, public officials, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8782 of March 5, 2012

National Consumer Protection Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Millions of Americans use financial products, including credit cards, 
mortgages, and student loans, to build the foundation for a better 
tomorrow. These tools help bring our aspirations within reach and 
empower countless individuals to earn an education, afford a home, or 
raise a family. Yet, irresponsible lending and deceptive practices pose 
serious risks to consumers and our economy alike. During National 
Consumer Protection Week, we recommit to empowering all Americans with 
the clear and concise information they need to make financial decisions, 
and to encouraging open and honest competition in the marketplace.

[[Page 12]]

For 14 years, consumer advocacy groups, private organizations, and 
agencies at every level of government have come together to celebrate 
National Consumer Protection Week by highlighting the ways individuals 
and families can protect themselves from scams, fraud, and abuse. Robust 
consumer education is essential to a healthy economy, and I encourage 
all Americans to learn more about money management, avoiding identity 
theft, understanding loans and mortgages, and other topics at: 
www.NCPW.gov.
With the leadership of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) 
and Director Richard Cordray, my Administration continues to look out 
for the interests of everyday Americans by strengthening oversight and 
accountability in the financial sector and fighting for the protections 
consumers deserve. Last year, we launched the ``Know Before You Owe'' 
campaign to simplify home loan applications, student financial aid 
packages, and credit card agreements and make it easier for consumers to 
compare options. We are reaching out to seniors, service members, and 
others who face unique financial challenges to help them access the 
tools and resources they need. To better understand the issues 
confronting consumers across our country, we are also engaging 
individuals and organizations and ensuring they have a voice at the 
CFPB. To share your own experience with consumer financial products, 
file a complaint, or find more information about how the CFPB is 
protecting American families, visit: www.ConsumerFinance.gov.
For centuries, our Nation has endeavored to uphold a principle that will 
forever remain at the heart of the American promise--that with hard work 
and responsibility, every individual deserves the opportunity to get 
ahead. As we continue to restore financial security through strong 
consumer protections, we help ensure no American is left to face unfair 
practices alone and every family has the chance to preserve and pass 
down what they have worked so hard to achieve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 4 through March 
10, 2012, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government 
officials, industry leaders, and advocates across the Nation to share 
information about consumer protection and provide our citizens with 
information about their rights as consumers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Agreement. I have decided that it is necessary to include these rules of 
origin, together with particular rules applicable to certain other 
goods, in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).
6. Section 202(o) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President, 
upon receiving a request from an interested entity, to determine that a 
fabric, yarn, or fiber is or is not available in commercial quantities 
in a timely manner in the United States; to establish procedures 
governing the submission of a request for any such determination and 
ensuring appropriate public participation in any such determination; to 
add to the list of the United States as set forth in Appendix 4-B-1 of 
the Agreement any fabric, yarn, or fiber determined to be not available 
in commercial quantities in a timely manner in the United States; or to 
remove from the list in Appendix 4-B-1 of the Agreement any fabric, 
yarn, or fiber that the President has previously added to that list.
7. Section 207 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
take certain enforcement actions relating to trade with Korea in textile 
and apparel goods.
8. Subtitle C of title III of the Implementation Act authorizes the 
President to take certain actions in response to a request by an 
interested party for relief from serious damage or actual threat thereof 
to a domestic industry producing certain textile or apparel articles.

[[Page 14]]

9. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established the 
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), 
consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, 
Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as 
Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. 
Consistent with section 301 of title 3, United States Code, when 
carrying out functions vested in the President by statute and assigned 
by the President to CITA, the officials collectively exercising those 
functions are all to be officers required to be appointed by the 
President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act''), 
19 U.S.C. 2483, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other Acts affecting 
import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, including the 
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or 
other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 604 of the 1974 Act; sections 105(a), 201, 202, 207, and 
subtitle C of title III of the Implementation Act; and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code, and having made the determination under 
section 101(b) of the Implementation Act necessary for the exchange of 
notes, do hereby proclaim:
    (1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff 
treatment being accorded under the Agreement, to set forth rules for 
determining whether goods imported into the customs territory of the 
United States are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the 
Agreement, to provide certain other treatment to originating goods of 
Korea for the purposes of the Agreement, the HTS is modified as set 
forth in Annex I of Publication 4308 of the United States International 
Trade Commission, entitled ``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States to Implement the United States-Korea Free 
Trade Agreement,'' which is incorporated by reference into this 
proclamation.
    (2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty elimination 
provided for in the Agreement and to provide for future staged 
reductions in duties for originating goods of Korea for purposes of the 
Agreement, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex II of Publication 
4308, effective on the dates specified in the relevant sections of such 
publication and on any subsequent dates set forth for such duty 
reductions in that publication.
    (3) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates 
indicated in the Annexes of Publication 4308.
    (4) The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to exercise the 
authority of the President under section 105(a) of the Implementation 
Act to establish or designate an office within the Department of 
Commerce to carry out the functions set forth in that section.
    (5) The CITA is authorized to exercise the authority of the 
President under section 202(o) of the Implementation Act to determine 
that a fabric, yarn, or fiber is or is not available in commercial 
quantities in a timely

[[Page 15]]

manner in the United States; to establish procedures governing the 
request for any such determination and ensuring appropriate public 
participation in any such determination; to add any fabric, yarn, or 
fiber determined to be not available in commercial quantities in a 
timely manner in the United States to the list in Appendix 4-B-1 of the 
Agreement; or to remove from the list in Appendix 4-B-1 of the Agreement 
any fabric, yarn, or fiber that the President has previously added to 
that list.
    (6) The CITA is authorized to exercise the authority of the 
President under section 207 of the Implementation Act to direct the 
exclusion of certain textile and apparel goods from the customs 
territory of the United States and to direct the denial of preferential 
tariff treatment to textile and apparel goods.
    (7) The CITA is authorized to exercise the functions of the 
President under subtitle C of title III of the Implementation Act to 
review requests, and to determine whether to commence consideration of 
such requests; after an appropriate determination, to cause to be 
published in the Federal Register a notice of commencement of 
consideration of a request and notice seeking public comment; to 
determine whether imports of a Korean textile or apparel article are 
causing serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry 
producing an article that is like, or directly competitive with, the 
imported article; and to provide relief from imports of an article that 
is the subject of an affirmative determination as to damage or threat.
    (8) The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is authorized to 
fulfill the obligations of the President under section 104 of the 
Implementation Act to obtain advice from the appropriate advisory 
committees and the United States International Trade Commission on the 
proposed implementation of an action by Presidential proclamation; to 
submit a report on such proposed action to the appropriate congressional 
committees; and to consult with those congressional committees regarding 
the proposed action.
    (9) The USTR is authorized to modify U.S. note 4 to subchapter XX of 
chapter 99 of the HTS in a notice published in the Federal Register to 
reflect modifications pursuant to paragraph (6) of this proclamation by 
the CITA to the list of fabrics, yarns, or fibers in Annex 4-B-1 of the 
Agreement.
    (10) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8784 of March 16, 2012

National Poison Prevention Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Unintentional drug overdose, exposure to harmful chemicals, and other 
types of accidental poisoning claim thousands of lives every year. On 
the 50th anniversary of National Poison Prevention Week, I encourage all 
Americans to help protect their loved ones by identifying poisoning 
hazards at home; using, storing, and disposing of medication safely and 
effectively; and learning more about how to prevent and respond to 
poison emergencies.
Though we have dramatically reduced the incidence of poisoning among 
children, accidental exposure to drugs and medicines, typical household 
chemicals, and other dangerous substances continues to threaten the 
health of our Nation's youth--particularly those under the age of six. 
Parents and caregivers can help prevent poisoning by storing chemicals 
and medication in locked or childproof cabinets beyond their children's 
reach, and by safely disposing of unused or expired prescription drugs. 
To find more information and safety tips, visit: www.CDC.gov.
Tragically, the mortality rate from unintentional drug overdose climbs 
higher every year. Misuse and abuse of prescription painkillers among 
teens and adults drives this trend. As we work to address this serious 
public health issue, we must do more to educate parents, young people, 
patients, and prescribers about the dangers of prescription drug abuse 
and the steps they can take to prevent it. Because the majority of 
individuals who abuse prescription pain relievers obtain them from 
friends or family, all of us can take action by using medications only 
as directed by a health care provider and removing old or unneeded 
medications from our homes. Additional resources on safe drug disposal 
are available at www.FDA.gov and www.DEAdiversion.USDOJ.gov.
In the event of an accidental poisoning, rapid response can make all the 
difference. The national poison help hotline is available to respond to 
poison emergencies and provide essential information 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week at 1-800-222-1222.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 18 through March 24, 2012, as National 
Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week 
by taking actions to protect their families from hazardous household 
materials and from misuse of prescription medications.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8785 of March 19, 2012

National Day of Honor

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Nine years ago, members of the United States Armed Forces crossed the 
sands of the Iraq-Kuwait border and began one of the most challenging 
missions our military has ever known. They left the comforts of home and 
family, volunteering in service to a cause greater than themselves. They 
braved insurgency and sectarian strife, knowing too well the danger of 
combat and the cost of conflict. Yet, through the dust and din and the 
fog of war, they never lost their resolve. Demonstrating unshakable 
fortitude and unwavering commitment to duty, our men and women in 
uniform served tour after tour, fighting block by block to help the 
Iraqi people seize the chance for a better future. And on December 18, 
2011, their mission came to an end.
Today, we honor their success, their service, and their sacrifice. In 
one of our Nation's longest wars, veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom 
and Operation New Dawn wrote one of the most extraordinary chapters in 
American military history. When highways became mine fields and 
uncertainty waited behind every corner, service members rose to meet the 
task at hand with unmatched courage and determination. They learned 
languages and cultures, taking on new roles as diplomats and development 
experts to improve the communities where they served. Their strength 
toppled a tyrant, and their valor helped build opportunity in 
oppression's place. Across nearly 9 years of conflict, the glory of 
their service--as well as the contributions of other members of the U.S. 
Government and our coalition partners--always shone through.
The war left wounds not always seen, but forever felt. The burden of 
distance and the pain of loss weighed heavily on the hearts of millions 
at home and overseas. Behind every member of our military stood a 
parent, a spouse, or a son or daughter who proudly served their 
community and prayed for their loved one's safe return. For wounded 
warriors, coming home marked the end of one battle and the beginning of 
another--to stand, to walk, to recover, and to serve again. And, in 
war's most profound cost, there were those who never came home. 
Separated by time and space but united by their love of country, nearly 
4,500 men and women are eternally bound; though we have laid them to 
rest, they will live on in the soul of our Nation now and forever. To 
them, to their families, and to all who served, we owe a debt that can 
never be fully repaid.
When we returned the colors of United States Forces-Iraq and the last of 
our troops set foot on American soil, we reflected on the extraordinary 
service and sacrifice of those who answered our country's call. Their 
example embodied that fundamental American faith that tells us no 
mission is

[[Page 18]]

too hard, no challenge is too great, and that through tests and through 
trials, we will always emerge stronger than before. Now, our Nation 
reaffirms our commitment to serve veterans of Iraq as well as they 
served us--to uphold the sacred trust we share with all who have worn 
the uniform. Our future is brighter for their service, and today, we 
express our gratitude by saying once more: Welcome home.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 19, 2012, as a 
National Day of Honor. I call upon all Americans to observe this day 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that commemorate 
the return of the United States Armed Forces from Iraq.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8786 of March 23, 2012

Cesar Chavez Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One of our Nation's great civil rights leaders, Cesar Estrada Chavez 
came of age as a migrant farm worker, witnessing the injustice that 
pervaded fields and vineyards across California. Facing discrimination, 
poverty, and dangerous working conditions, laborers toiled for little 
pay and without access to even the most basic necessities. Yet amidst 
hardship and abuse, Cesar Chavez saw the promise of change--the 
unlimited potential of a community organized around a common purpose. 
Today, we celebrate his courage, reflect on his lifetime of advocacy, 
and recognize the power in each of us to lift up lives and pursue social 
justice.
Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other 
visionary leaders, Cesar Chavez based his campaign on principles of 
nonviolence, which he called ``the quality of the heart.'' Through 
boycotts, fasts, strikes, and marches that demanded both endurance and 
imagination, he drew thousands together in support of ``La Causa''--a 
mission to ensure respect, dignity, and fair treatment for farm workers. 
Alongside Dolores Huerta, he founded the United Farm Workers of America 
(UFW), an organization tasked with defending and empowering the men and 
women who feed the world.
As a tribute to Cesar Chavez's life and work, my Administration 
designated the Forty Acres site in Delano, California, as a National 
Historical Landmark last year, forever commemorating the birthplace of 
the UFW. In May 2011, the United States Navy named the USNS Cesar Chavez 
in recognition of his service during World War II. And this month, we 
honor ten Americans as Champions of Change for their commitment to 
realizing Cesar Chavez's dream of a more just tomorrow. Decades after 
his struggle began,

[[Page 19]]

Cesar Chavez's legacy lives on in all who draw inspiration from the 
values of service, determination, and community that ignited his 
movement.
On the 85th anniversary of Cesar Chavez's birth, we are reminded of what 
we can accomplish when we recognize our common humanity. He told us, 
``We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and 
prosperity for our community. Our ambitions must be broad enough to 
include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our 
own.'' As we honor his broad ambitions and expansive vision, let us 
pledge to stand forever on the side of equal opportunity and justice for 
all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 31, 2012, as 
Cesar Chavez Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate service, community, and education programs to honor Cesar 
Chavez's enduring legacy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8787 of March 23, 2012

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Two hundred and thirty-six years ago, a new American Nation was founded 
on an old Greek principle--democratic rule by a free people. We trace 
this enduring idea to ancient Hellas, where Greeks brought forth the 
world's first democracy and kindled a philosophical tradition that would 
stand the test of time. Over two millennia later, the Greek people rose 
up to reclaim their heritage as citizens of a sovereign nation. Today, 
on the 191st anniversary of Greece's independence, we commemorate that 
struggle to restore democracy in its birthplace, renew the bonds that 
bring our countries together, and celebrate the Hellenic ideals that 
continue to shape the American experience.
As America's Founders built a Government of the people, by the people, 
and for the people, they drew inspiration from the democratic pioneers 
who shaped a small group of ancient Greek city states. In the years 
since, Greece and America have strengthened that connection through 
shared history and deep partnerships between our people. During the 
American Civil War, Greek Americans served and fought to preserve our 
Union. Through two World Wars and a long Cold War, America and Greece 
stood as allies in the pursuit of peace. And for generations, Greek 
Americans have profoundly enriched our national life. They stand as 
leaders in every field and

[[Page 20]]

every part of our society, and their cultural legacy still echoes in 
classrooms, courtrooms, and communities across our Nation.
On Greek Independence Day, we commemorate the proud traditions that tie 
our nations together and honor all those who trace their lineage to the 
Hellenic Republic. Nearly 200 years after the Greek people won their war 
to return democracy to their homeland and become a sovereign state, we 
reaffirm the warm friendship and solidarity that will guide our work 
together in the years ahead.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2012, as 
Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy. I call upon all the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8788 of March 26, 2012

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 502(b)(2)(E) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(2)(E)), provides that the President shall not 
designate any country a beneficiary developing country under the 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) if such country fails to act in 
good faith in recognizing as binding or in enforcing arbitral awards in 
favor of United States citizens or a corporation, partnership, or 
association that is 50 percent or more beneficially owned by United 
States citizens, which have been made by arbitrators appointed for each 
case or by permanent arbitral bodies to which the parties involved have 
submitted their dispute. Section 502(d)(2) (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)(2)) 
provides that, after complying with the requirements of section 
502(f)(2) (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)), the President shall withdraw or 
suspend the designation of any country as a beneficiary developing 
country if, after such designation, the President determines that as the 
result of changed circumstances such country would be barred from 
designation as a beneficiary developing country under section 502(b)(2). 
Section 502(f)(2) requires the President to notify the Congress and the 
country concerned at least 60 days before terminating the country's 
designation as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
2. Having considered the factors set forth in section 502(b)(2)(E) of 
the 1974 Act, I have determined pursuant to section 502(d) that it is 
appropriate to suspend Argentina's designation as a GSP beneficiary 
developing country

[[Page 21]]

because it has not acted in good faith in enforcing arbitral awards in 
favor of United States citizens or a corporation, partnership, or 
association that is 50 percent or more beneficially owned by United 
States citizens, and I will so notify the Congress. In order to reflect 
the suspension of Argentina's status as a beneficiary developing country 
under the GSP, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify 
general note 4(a) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(HTS).
3. Pursuant to section 502(a) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)), the 
President is authorized to designate countries as beneficiary developing 
countries and to designate any beneficiary developing country as a 
least-developed beneficiary developing country, for purposes of the GSP. 
Section 502(f)(1)(A) (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(1)(A)) requires the President to 
notify the Congress before designating any country as a beneficiary 
developing country. Section 502(f)(1)(B) (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(1)(B)) 
requires the President to notify the Congress at least 60 days before 
designating any country as a least-developed beneficiary country.
4. Pursuant to section 502(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, having considered the 
factors set forth in section 502(c) (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have 
determined that the Republic of South Sudan should be designated as a 
beneficiary developing country under the GSP, and I will so notify the 
Congress.
5. Pursuant to section 502(a)(2) of the 1974 Act, having considered the 
factors set forth in section 502(c), I have determined that the Republic 
of South Sudan should also be designated as a least-developed 
beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, and I will so 
notify the Congress.
6. Section 203(o) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United 
States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``CAFTA-DR 
Implementation Act'') (19 U.S.C. 4033(o)) authorizes the President to 
proclaim as part of the HTS the provisions set out in Annex 4.1 of the 
Dominican Republic- Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
(CAFTA-DR).
7. Appendix 4.1-B of Annex 4.1 of the CAFTA-DR provides that ``[f]or 
purposes of determining whether a good of chapter 62 of the Harmonized 
System is originating, materials used in the production of such a good 
that are produced in Canada or Mexico and that would be originating 
under this Agreement if produced in the territory of a Party shall be 
considered as having been produced in the territory of a Party.'' For 
the Dominican Republic, this rule entered into effect only with regard 
to Mexico. Furthermore, under the terms of Appendix 4.1-B, for 
operations performed in the Dominican Republic, this rule would no 
longer apply to Mexican-produced materials 5 years from the date CAFTA-
DR enters into force, unless within that 5-year period, the Dominican 
Republic concludes a free trade agreement with Mexico and provides 
written notification to the United States and other Parties to the 
CAFTA-DR that the Dominican Republic and Mexico have taken actions 
necessary to provide reciprocal application of the rule. The 5-year 
period expired on March 1, 2012, and the Dominican Republic has not 
concluded a free trade agreement with Mexico. Accordingly, the rule set 
out in Appendix 4.1-B to Annex 4.1 of the CAFTA-DR, no longer applies to 
operations performed in the Dominican Republic, and the HTS must be 
modified to implement this provision of Annex 4.1.
8. Section 3 of the Haiti Economic Lift Program Act of 2010, Public Law 
111-171, amended section 213(b) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery 
Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)), to extend the duration of duty-

[[Page 22]]

free treatment for certain apparel articles qualifying as the product of 
a beneficiary country under the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act 
until September 30, 2020. A modification to the HTS needs to be made to 
reflect this amendment.
9. Presidential Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011, modified the HTS 
to conform it to the International Convention on the Harmonized 
Commodity Description and Coding System (the ``Convention''). Technical 
corrections to the HTS are necessary to ensure conformity with the 
Convention.
10. Presidential Proclamation 8783 of March 6, 2012, authorized the 
United States Trade Representative to modify U.S. note 4 to subchapter 
XX of chapter 99 of the HTS in a notice published in the Federal 
Register to reflect modifications made by the Committee for the 
Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) to the list of fabrics, 
yarns, or fibers in Annex 4-B-1 of the United States-Korea Free Trade 
Agreement. That authorization erroneously referred to paragraph (6), and 
instead should refer to paragraph (5) of that proclamation.
11. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions 
of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions 
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, section 203(o) of the CAFTA-DR 
Implementation Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do 
proclaim that:
(1) The designation of Argentina as a beneficiary developing country 
under the GSP is suspended on the date that is 60 days after the date 
this proclamation is published in the Federal Register.
(2) In order to reflect the suspension of Argentina's designation as a 
beneficiary developing country under the GSP, general note 4 of the HTS 
is modified as set forth in section A of the Annex to this proclamation, 
effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after the date that is 60 days after the date 
this proclamation is published in the Federal Register.
(3) The Republic of South Sudan is designated as a beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective on the date that 
is 20 days after the date of this proclamation.
(4) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 4(a) 
to the HTS is modified by adding in alphabetical order ``South Sudan'' 
to the list entitled, ``Independent Countries,'' effective with respect 
to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after the date that is 20 days after the date of this proclamation.
(5) The Republic of South Sudan is designated as a least-developed 
beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective 60 
days after the date this proclamation is published in the Federal 
Register.

[[Page 23]]

(6) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 
4(b)(i) is modified by adding in alphabetical order ``South Sudan,'' 
effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after the date that is 60 days after the date 
this proclamation is published in the Federal Register.
(7) In order to implement Appendix 4.1-B to Annex 4.1 of the CAFTA-DR, 
with respect to operations performed in the Dominican Republic, the HTS 
is modified as set forth in section B of the Annex to this proclamation.
(8) The modifications to the HTS set forth in section B of the Annex to 
this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after March 1, 2012.
(9) In order to implement section 3 of the Haiti Economic Lift Program 
Act of 2010, the HTS is modified as set forth in section C of the Annex 
to this proclamation.
(10) The modification to the HTS set forth in section C of the Annex to 
this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after May 24, 2010.
(11) In order to make the technical corrections to the HTS necessary to 
conform to the Convention, the HTS is modified as set forth in section D 
of the Annex to this proclamation.
(12) The modifications to the HTS set forth in section D of the Annex to 
this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after February 3, 2012.
(13) Paragraph (9) of Presidential Proclamation 8783 is amended to 
provide that the United States Trade Representative is authorized to 
modify U.S. note 4 to subchapter XX of chapter 99 of the HTS in a notice 
published in the Federal Register to reflect modifications pursuant to 
paragraph (5) of Presidential Proclamation 8783 by the CITA to the list 
of fabrics, yarns, or fibers in Annex 4-B-1 of the United States-Korea 
Free Trade Agreement.
(14) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8789 of March 29, 2012

Vietnam Veterans Day

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On January 12, 1962, United States Army pilots lifted more than 1,000 
South Vietnamese service members over jungle and underbrush to capture a 
National Liberation Front stronghold near Saigon. Operation Chopper 
marked America's first combat mission against the Viet Cong, and the 
beginning of one of our longest and most challenging wars. Through more 
than a decade of conflict that tested the fabric of our Nation, the 
service of our men and women in uniform stood true. Fifty years after 
that fateful mission, we honor the more than 3 million Americans who 
served, we pay tribute to those we have laid to rest, and we reaffirm 
our dedication to showing a generation of veterans the respect and 
support of a grateful Nation.
The Vietnam War is a story of service members of different backgrounds, 
colors, and creeds who came together to complete a daunting mission. It 
is a story of Americans from every corner of our Nation who left the 
warmth of family to serve the country they loved. It is a story of 
patriots who braved the line of fire, who cast themselves into harm's 
way to save a friend, who fought hour after hour, day after day to 
preserve the liberties we hold dear. From Ia Drang to Hue, they won 
every major battle of the war and upheld the highest traditions of our 
Armed Forces.
Eleven years of combat left their imprint on a generation. Thousands 
returned home bearing shrapnel and scars; still more were burdened by 
the invisible wounds of post-traumatic stress, of Agent Orange, of 
memories that would never fade. More than 58,000 laid down their lives 
in service to our Nation. Now and forever, their names are etched into 
two faces of black granite, a lasting memorial to those who bore 
conflict's greatest cost.
Our veterans answered our country's call and served with honor, and on 
March 29, 1973, the last of our troops left Vietnam. Yet, in one of the 
war's most profound tragedies, many of these men and women came home to 
be shunned or neglected--to face treatment unbefitting their courage and 
a welcome unworthy of their example. We must never let this happen 
again. Today, we reaffirm one of our most fundamental obligations: to 
show all who have worn the uniform of the United States the respect and 
dignity they deserve, and to honor their sacrifice by serving them as 
well as they served us. Half a century after those helicopters swept off 
the ground and into the annals of history, we pay tribute to the fallen, 
the missing, the wounded, the millions who served, and the millions more 
who awaited their return. Our Nation stands stronger for their service, 
and on Vietnam Veterans Day, we honor their proud legacy with our 
deepest gratitude.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 29, 2012, as 
Vietnam Veterans Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that commemorate the 
50-year anniversary of the Vietnam War.

Proclamation 8790 of April 2, 2012

National Cancer Control Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year, an estimated half a million Americans will lose their lives 
to cancer, and three times that many will be diagnosed with this 
devastating illness. Cancer patients are parents and grandparents, 
children and cherished friends; the disease touches almost all of us and 
casts a shadow over families and communities across our Nation. Yet, 
today, we stand at a critical moment in cancer research that promises 
significant advances for patients and an accelerated pace of lifesaving 
discoveries. During National Cancer Control Month, we remember those we 
have lost, support Americans fighting this disease, and recommit to 
progress toward effective cancer control.
Prevention and screening are our best defenses against cancer. All 
Americans can reduce their risk by keeping a healthy diet, exercising 
regularly, limiting sun exposure, avoiding excessive alcohol 
consumption, and living tobacco-free. Because tobacco use causes a wide 
variety of cancers and chronic lung diseases, I encourage individuals 
struggling to quit to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or visit www.SmokeFree.gov for 
help and information.
Regular screening and check-ups with a health professional can also play 
a key role in preventing cancer and detecting the disease early, when it 
is often most treatable. Under the Affordable Care Act, over 54 million 
Americans with private health coverage have already received preventive 
services--including mammograms and other cancer screenings--at no 
additional cost. For more resources on how to reduce the risk of 
developing cancer, visit www.Cancer.gov.
Federally funded research has brought about landmark advances in cancer 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment that promise real change for the 
millions of Americans facing this disease. Sophisticated analysis 
continues to shed light on the molecular basis of cancer and unlock new 
therapies. Innovative studies are paving the way for effective 
treatments to deadly cancers, including melanoma. And new research shows 
that screening procedures can reduce mortality from lung cancer, which 
could save lives among those at greatest risk. As we move forward, my 
Administration will continue to support groundbreaking cancer research 
that brings hope to countless individuals and families across our 
country.
Over the past several decades, we have made remarkable progress in 
understanding and combatting cancer. We owe the knowledge we have gained 
and the lives we have saved to the countless doctors, patients, 
families, and

[[Page 29]]

researchers whose dedication and perseverance have led the way to 
today's most promising technologies and treatments. During National 
Cancer Control Month, we pay tribute to the men, women, and children we 
have lost to cancer, and we look ahead to a future in which more 
Americans have the opportunity to live out the full measure of their 
days in health and happiness.
The Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved March 
28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103), as amended, has requested the 
President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April as ``Cancer 
Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 2012 as National Cancer Control Month. 
I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control 
cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8791 of April 2, 2012

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As parents, as communities, and as a Nation, the work of raising our 
children stands among our greatest responsibilities and our most 
profound blessings. The support we give and the examples we set form 
cornerstones for their success, and by teaching our children to trust in 
themselves, we equip them with confidence, hope, and determination that 
can last a lifetime. Tragically, neglect and abuse erode this 
fundamental promise for too many young Americans. During National Child 
Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our commitment to break the cycle of 
violence, strengthen support for all who have been affected, and empower 
our young people with the best we have to offer.
Over half a million American children suffer neglect or abuse every 
year. A strong and well-informed family unit is the surest defense 
against child abuse, and parents and caregivers who have support--from 
relatives, friends, neighbors, and their communities--are more likely to 
provide safe and healthy homes for their children. Trusted friends and 
active community members can help ensure families get the support they 
need by offering their time and resources, taking an active role in 
children's lives, and fostering a safe environment for young people to 
learn and grow. By coming together in service to our communities, we do 
more to meet our obligation to do right by the next generation.
My Administration continues to prioritize the health and well-being of 
children across our country. With partners at every level of government

[[Page 30]]

and throughout the private sector, we are supporting services that 
protect young Americans from abuse and neglect and extend help to those 
who have been affected. We are investing in early learning programs and 
supporting initiatives that promote positive outcomes for children and 
families. And we are connecting parents and professionals to new tools 
to identify, treat, and prevent abuse. I encourage all Americans to 
learn more about what they can do at: www.ChildWelfare.gov/Preventing.
Every child deserves the opportunity to grow up with the promise and 
protection of a loving family. This month, we recommit to that vision, 
and to providing care, stability, and a brighter future for our sons and 
daughters.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2012 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month with programs and activities that help prevent child abuse and 
provide for children's physical, emotional, and developmental needs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8792 of April 2, 2012

National Donate Life Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

With quiet compassion and exceptional generosity, organ and tissue 
donors leave an indelible mark on the lives of countless Americans. 
Their selfless acts inspire hope at moments of profound need, and they 
recall the giving spirit that lies at the heart of our national 
character. During National Donate Life Month, we reflect on that 
essential quality and recommit to saving lives through organ and tissue 
donation.
The need for donors is greater than ever before. Today, more than 
110,000 Americans await an organ transplant, and while many individuals 
will receive lifesaving treatment, too many will pass before help 
arrives. All of us can play a part in ending this unacceptable loss of 
life. I encourage every American to consider becoming an organ and 
tissue donor; to consult their family, friends, physician, or faith 
leader about their decision; and if they choose to be a donor, to 
register on their state organ donor registry. To learn more about organ 
and tissue donation and how to enroll in a donor registry, visit: 
www.OrganDonor.gov.
Even as millions of Americans choose to donate life, our Nation 
continues to face a shortage of donors that impacts patients and 
families across our country. This month, we renew our commitment to 
addressing this urgent public health issue, supporting donors and their 
families, and ensuring every individual has access to the care and 
services they need.

[[Page 31]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2012 as National 
Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, 
educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and 
private organizations to join forces to boost the number of organ and 
tissue donors throughout our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8793 of April 2, 2012

National Financial Capability Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our country, millions of Americans work hard and play by the 
rules to protect the gains they have made and secure a brighter future 
for their loved ones. The resilience and ingenuity of our people are 
driving our economic recovery, and as we lay the foundation for an 
America built to last, we must also promote a financial system that is 
fair and sound for all. During National Financial Capability Month, we 
recommit to ensuring everyone has access to the information and tools 
that empower them to operate safely and smartly in the marketplace.
A strong and stable economy requires responsibility from top to bottom--
from banks and borrowers to workers and executives. To protect everyday 
Americans from abuses in the financial industry, I appointed Richard 
Cordray to head the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB). His 
responsibility--and that of the CFPB--is to ensure all Americans have 
the resources they need to make sound financial decisions, and to 
guarantee every individual receives fair treatment when they apply for a 
mortgage, take out a student loan, or use a credit card.
As we work to put an end to predatory behavior in our financial markets, 
my Administration is taking action to empower individuals and families 
with the tools they need to get ahead. Last year, we collaborated with 
representatives from the private, public, and non-profit industries to 
release the National Strategy for Financial Literacy--a comprehensive 
plan to improve financial education across our country. The President's 
Advisory Council on Financial Capability (PACFC) continues to identify 
and promote the most effective, data-driven strategies to better educate 
Americans on financial issues. With help from the PACFC, we are working 
to provide our young people with financial skills to become successful 
students, entrepreneurs, and leaders; to ensure American workers are 
able to provide for their loved ones and save for retirement; and to 
foster financial capability in families and communities across our 
Nation.

[[Page 32]]

During National Financial Capability Month, we rededicate ourselves to 
advancing robust consumer education and to helping every individual take 
ownership of their financial future. I encourage all Americans to take 
advantage of the free, reliable financial resources at www.MyMoney.gov, 
www.ConsumerFinance.gov, and 1-888-MyMoney.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2012 as National 
Financial Capability Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month with programs and activities to improve their understanding of 
financial principles and practices.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8794 of April 2, 2012

National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Though we have come far in the fight to reduce sexual violence, the 
prevalence of sexual assault remains an affront to our national 
conscience that we cannot ignore. This month, we stand with survivors of 
sexual assault, join together to break the silence, and recommit to 
ending this devastating crime.
Rape and sexual assault inflict profound suffering upon millions of 
Americans every year. Nearly one in five women has been raped, and still 
more have endured other forms of sexual violence or abuse. Tragically, 
these crimes take their greatest toll on young people; women between the 
ages of 16 and 24 are at greatest risk of rape and sexual assault, and 
many victims, male and female, first experience abuse during childhood. 
The trauma of sexual violence leaves scars that may never fully heal. 
Many survivors experience depression, fear, and suicidal feelings in the 
months and years following an assault, and some face health problems 
that last a lifetime.
It is up to all of us to ensure victims of sexual violence are not left 
to face these trials alone. Too often, survivors suffer in silence, 
fearing retribution, lack of support, or that the criminal justice 
system will fail to bring the perpetrator to justice. We must do more to 
raise awareness about the realities of sexual assault; confront and 
change insensitive attitudes wherever they persist; enhance training and 
education in the criminal justice system; and expand access to critical 
health, legal, and protection services for survivors. As we fight sexual 
assault in our communities, so must we combat this crime within our 
Armed Forces. The Department of Defense provides additional resources 
for service members and military families at 1-877-995-5247 and at: 
www.SafeHelpline.org.

[[Page 33]]

With the leadership of Vice President Joe Biden, my Administration is 
working to stop sexual violence before it begins and ensure justice for 
the countless men, women, and children who have already been harmed. 
Last year, we introduced comprehensive guidance to schools, colleges, 
and universities to clarify their obligations under existing civil 
rights law to prevent and respond to campus sexual assault. In January, 
we issued a revised definition of rape that will improve our 
understanding of where and how often this crime occurs. And today, we 
are collaborating with private organizations and agencies at every level 
of government to bolster advocacy and assistance for victims of sexual 
violence. All of us share a responsibility to those in need. By standing 
with survivors of rape and sexual assault and helping them secure the 
support and services they deserve, we do right by the ideals of 
compassion and service at the heart of the American character. For 
additional information and resources, visit: www.WhiteHouse.gov/
1is2many.
During National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we 
rededicate ourselves to breaking the cycle of violence that threatens 
lives, erodes communities, and weakens our country. As we reflect on the 
progress we have made and the distance we have yet to go, let us 
recommit to empowering survivors and fighting for a safer future for 
every American.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2012 as National 
Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to 
support survivors of sexual assault and work together to prevent these 
crimes in their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8795 of April 2, 2012

World Autism Awareness Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) affect young people and adults of every 
background, and millions of American families know the weight of their 
impact. On World Autism Awareness Day, we recognize ASDs as a growing 
public health issue and recommit to supporting those living with an ASD 
and their loved ones.
We have made great strides in our understanding of the autism spectrum, 
and today, children and adults with ASDs are leading independent and 
productive lives. However, barriers still remain for these individuals 
and their families. As a Nation, we share a responsibility to ensure 
persons living with ASDs have the opportunity to pursue their full 
measure of happiness and achieve their greatest potential.

[[Page 34]]

Meeting the needs of Americans on the autism spectrum remains a priority 
for my Administration. Last September, I was proud to sign the Combating 
Autism Reauthorization Act, which provides critical funding for autism 
research, education, early detection, and support and services for 
children and adults. Under the Affordable Care Act, new insurance plans 
are required to cover autism screenings and developmental assessments 
for children at no additional cost to parents. Insurance companies can 
no longer deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions, and 
young people can stay on their parents' health insurance plan until age 
26, easing financial burdens for families. With the Department of 
Education, we are making substantial investments in enhancing education 
for children on the autism spectrum--from early learning to higher 
education. And federally funded research continues to explore how we can 
improve independent living, develop assistive technology, and advance 
vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with autism. For 
additional information and resources, I encourage all Americans to visit 
www.HHS.gov/autism.
As new policies and bold actions break down old barriers and reshape 
attitudes, we move closer to a world free of discrimination and full of 
understanding for our family members and friends living with ASDs. On 
World Autism Awareness Day, let us reaffirm our dedication to supporting 
those on the autism spectrum and their families, and let us continue the 
work of ensuring all our people have a chance at achieving the American 
dream.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2, 2012, as 
World Autism Awareness Day. I encourage all Americans to learn more 
about autism and what they can do to support individuals on the autism 
spectrum and their families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8796 of April 3, 2012

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For centuries, the pursuit of knowledge and the cultivation of character 
have driven American progress and enriched our national life. On 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., we renew our commitment to these 
timeless aspirations, and we rededicate ourselves to fostering in our 
sons and daughters inquiring minds and compassionate hearts.
In a global economy where more than half of new jobs will demand higher 
education or advanced training, we must do everything we can to equip 
our children with the tools for success. Their journey begins early, and 
it demands stewardship from throughout the community--from parents and

[[Page 35]]

caregivers who inspire a love of learning to teachers and mentors who 
guide our children along the path to achievement. Our Nation's 
prosperity grows with theirs, and by ensuring every child has access to 
a world class education, we reach for a brighter future for all 
Americans.
Yet, we also move forward knowing we cannot secure the promise of 
tomorrow through formal education alone. With each generation, our 
Nation has confronted questions that tested the quality and character of 
our people. We have borne witness to seemingly insurmountable problems 
of inequality, oppression, or dire circumstance at home and abroad, and 
where we have recognized injustice, the way forward has not always been 
clear. Time and again, during moments of trial, Americans have 
demonstrated a fundamental commitment to compassion, cooperation, and 
goodwill toward others--doing not what is easy, but what is right. These 
qualities have come to define us, and as we prepare today's students to 
become tomorrow's leaders, let us nourish in them the virtues that have 
sustained our country for generations.
On Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., we reflect on the teachings of 
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who embodied 
that humanitarian spirit. As a tireless advocate for youth around the 
world, he inspired millions to lift the cause of education, to practice 
kindness and generosity, and to aspire toward their highest ideals. His 
enduring legacy lives on in those he touched, and today, we resolve to 
carry forward his dedication to service and scholarship.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 3, 2012, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8797 of April 9, 2012

National Volunteer Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation has been profoundly shaped by ordinary Americans who have 
volunteered their time and energy to overcome extraordinary challenges. 
From the American Revolution and the Seneca Falls Convention to the 
everyday acts of compassion and purpose that move millions to make 
change in their communities, our Nation has always been at its best when 
individuals have come together to realize a common vision. As we 
continue to pursue progress, service and social innovation will play an 
essential role in achieving our highest ambitions--from a world-class 
education for every child to an economy built to last. During National 
Volunteer Week, we pay

[[Page 36]]

tribute to all who give of themselves to keep America strong, and we 
renew the spirit of service that has enriched our country for 
generations.
That spirit lives on today in countless acts of service around our 
country. When one of the deadliest tornados in our Nation's history 
touched down in Joplin, Missouri, in May 2011, thousands of volunteers 
stepped forward to serve their fellow citizens. They turned a university 
into a hospital. They repurposed doors for stretchers. They rushed food 
to those in need and filled trucks with donations. To date, they have 
committed more than half a million hours to bringing support and shelter 
to a community during a time of profound hardship and heartache. In 
Joplin and across America, we see the transformative power of service--
to unite, to build, to heal.
My Administration remains steadfast in our commitment to empower more 
Americans with tools to shape their communities. During my first 100 
days in office, I was proud to sign the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America 
Act, a landmark national service law that laid out a strategy to link 
service with innovation, established the groundbreaking Social 
Innovation Fund, and charted the expansion of AmeriCorps. Last month, we 
launched FEMA Corps, a new service corps that will enhance our national 
capacity for disaster response and prepare its members for careers in 
emergency management. Through United We Serve and national service days, 
we continue to connect individuals young and old to new opportunities to 
reinvent their world through service--from fighting hunger and expanding 
access to healthy, affordable food to mentoring young people and 
fostering literacy. In all of these efforts, we are reminded how 
volunteer work can expand opportunity not only for those in need, but 
also for those who give. Service can teach valuable skills that pave the 
way to long-term employment and stay with volunteers throughout their 
careers and lives.
Service is a lifelong pursuit that strengthens the civic and economic 
fabric of our Nation. With every hour and every act, our lives are made 
richer, our communities are drawn closer, and our country is forged 
stronger by the dedication and generous spirit of volunteers. I 
encourage every American to stand up and play their part--to put their 
shoulder up against the wheel and help change history's course. To get 
started on a project near you, visit www.Serve.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 15 through April 
21, 2012, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this week by volunteering in service projects across our country 
and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8798 of April 9, 2012

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In April of 1890, delegates from countries throughout the Americas 
gathered in Washington, D.C., united in the belief that cooperation 
would lead to a more peaceful, secure, and prosperous hemisphere. 
Demonstrating remarkable foresight and a commitment to progress, they 
came together to forge a community of nations that would one day become 
the Organization of American States--a body dedicated to the pursuit of 
democracy and economic opportunity for all our people. During Pan 
American Day and Pan American Week, we celebrate this legacy of 
international partnership and renew the bonds of friendship and shared 
responsibility that join us in common purpose.
The United States is proud to be part of the inter-American community. 
From the shores of Canada to the cliffs of Cape Horn, our hopes are 
bound together--to create greater social and economic opportunity for 
all, to ensure safety for our citizens, to build strong and accountable 
democratic institutions, to secure a clean energy future. Our Nation 
remains committed to working together with partners across our 
hemisphere to achieve these goals.
Last October, I was proud to sign legislation to implement Free Trade 
Agreements with Panama and Colombia that will support American jobs, 
open new markets to our exports, and spur growth here at home and 
throughout the region. These Agreements strengthen our partnerships, and 
they reflect our commitment to supporting democracy and economic 
opportunity throughout the Americas. We are also working to fuel 
education and innovation across our hemisphere. One year ago, we 
announced the 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative to encourage 
more of our students to study abroad in Latin America and more Latin 
American students to study here in the United States, fostering lifelong 
connections between our nations that will be keys to progress. And as we 
move forward, we continue to support strong democracies and democratic 
institutions that promote transparency in government, respect the rule 
of law, ensure a robust civil society, respect human rights, and deliver 
public services in effective and equitable ways.
This week, we gather in Cartagena, Colombia, for the Sixth Summit of the 
Americas. As 34 Heads of State and Government come together to chart a 
path toward tomorrow's horizons, let us recall that though we are 
stewards of unique and varied histories, our nations are partners in 
progress. During Pan American Day and Pan American Week, we celebrate 
our shared heritage, reflect on the gains we have made, and recommit to 
advancing the common prosperity and security of all our people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2012, as Pan 
American Day and April 8 through April 14, 2012, as Pan American Week. I 
urge the governors of the 50 States, the governor of the Commonwealth

[[Page 38]]

of Puerto Rico, and the officials of the other areas under the flag of 
the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate

Proclamation 8799 of April 9, 2012

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than 200 years, members of our Armed Forces have upheld an oath 
to protect and defend. In times of war, generations have answered our 
country's call with courage and valor, braving the peril of combat and 
pressing onward in the face of tremendous adversity. Their extraordinary 
service reflects our highest ideals, and their sacrifice will forever 
live on in our national memory. On National Former Prisoner of War 
Recognition Day, we pay solemn tribute to those patriots who gave their 
freedom to preserve our own.
Thousands of America's sons and daughters have suffered unspeakably as 
captives in foreign lands. Many prisoners of war experienced physical 
torture and profound anguish, subjected to inhumane treatment and cut 
off from their comrades, their country, and their loved ones. Some would 
never return. Yet, in the direst circumstances, these service members 
demonstrated indomitable courage and unbreakable resolve. They stood 
fast for what they believed in, making immeasurable sacrifices for the 
millions they protected. At home, spouses, children, parents, and 
friends called upon that same spirit of perseverance to sustain them 
through long periods of prayer and uncertainty.
When he chronicled the experiences of our GIs during World War II, Ernie 
Pyle wrote that their world can never be known to the rest of us. Though 
the sacrifices they made and the burdens they bore may defy our full 
understanding, it is our moral obligation to keep faith with our men and 
women in uniform, our veterans, and their families--to honor their 
service through the support of a grateful Nation. Today, we recognize 
heroes who endured one of war's most tragic costs. For them, and for all 
who have served, let us rededicate ourselves to fulfilling the sacred 
trust we share with all those who have worn the uniform of the United 
States of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2012, as 
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this day of remembrance by honoring all American 
prisoners of war, our service members, and our veterans. I also call 
upon Federal, State,

[[Page 39]]

and local government officials and organizations to observe this day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8800 of April 17, 2012

National Equal Pay Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Working women power America's economy and sustain our middle class. For 
millions of families across our country, women's wages mean food on the 
table, decent medical care, and timely mortgage payments. Yet, in 2010--
47 years after President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 
1963--women who worked full-time earned only 77 percent of what their 
male counterparts did. The pay gap was even greater for African American 
and Latina women, with African American women earning 64 cents and 
Latina women earning 56 cents for every dollar earned by a Caucasian 
man. National Equal Pay Day represents the date in the current year 
through which women must work to match what men earned in the previous 
year, reminding us that we must keep striving for an America where 
everyone gets an equal day's pay for an equal day's work.
At a time when families across our country are struggling to make ends 
meet, ensuring a fair wage for all parents is more important than ever. 
Women are breadwinners in a growing number of families, and women's 
earnings play an increasingly important role in families' incomes. For 
them, fair pay is even more than a basic right--it is an economic 
necessity.
That is why my Administration is committed to securing equal pay for 
equal work. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the first bill I signed as 
President, empowers women to recover wages lost to discrimination by 
extending the time period in which an employee can file a claim. In 
2010, I was proud to create the National Equal Pay Task Force to 
identify and combat equal pay violations. The Task Force has helped 
women recover millions in lost wages, built collaborative training 
programs that educate employees about their rights and inform employers 
of their obligations, and facilitated an unprecedented level of inter-
agency coordination to improve enforcement of equal pay laws.
Working women are at the heart of an America built to last. Equal pay 
will strengthen our families, grow our economy, and enable the best 
ideas and boldest innovations to flourish--regardless of the innovator's 
gender. On National Equal Pay Day, let us resolve to become a Nation 
that values the contributions of our daughters as much as those of our 
sons, denies them no opportunity, and sets no limits on their dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 40]]

the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 17, 2012, as 
National Equal Pay Day. I call upon all Americans to recognize the full 
value of women's skills and their significant contributions to the labor 
force, acknowledge the injustice of wage discrimination, and join 
efforts to achieve equal pay.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8801 of April 20, 2012

National Park Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When President Theodore Roosevelt first took office over a century ago, 
he embarked on a tour of the American West that would change his life 
and the life of our Nation forever. He traveled from Yellowstone's 
geysers, to Yosemite's granite cliffs, to Dakota's Badlands, ever moved 
by the natural wonders of which he and all Americans were proud 
inheritors. As he explored wild country, he heard a call to preserve our 
country's heritage that echoed throughout our forests and river valleys. 
He remarked of the Grand Canyon, ``the ages have been at work on it, and 
man can only mar it.''
From that sense of commitment sprang five National Parks, 18 National 
Monuments, 51 Federal bird reservations, and 150 National Forests. From 
that commitment sprang an effort to save the great Redwoods of 
California and the Petrified Forest of Arizona, the great bird rocks of 
the Aleutian Islands and the Tongass of Alaska. President Roosevelt 
inspired a breathtaking legacy of conservation that has forever enriched 
our lives, and in the decades since his historic journey, millions have 
worked to build on his enduring mission. When the fate of our lands and 
waters has been cast into doubt, they have taken the long view--that as 
Americans and as inhabitants of this one small planet, it is up to us to 
preserve our national heritage for our children, grandchildren, and for 
the generations to come.
That spirit drives my Administration today. Since I took office, we have 
set aside more than 2 million acres of Federal wilderness and thousands 
of miles of trails and rivers under the Omnibus Public Land Management 
Act. Last November, I was proud to establish the Fort Monroe National 
Monument, forever enshrining a site of profound historical and cultural 
significance. Today, I designated Fort Ord as a National Monument that 
will not only protect one of the crown jewels of California's coast--a 
world-class destination for hikers, mountain bikers, and outdoor 
enthusiasts--but also honor the heroism and dedication of men and women 
who served our Nation during the major conflicts of the 20th century. 
And with the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, we continue to advance 
a smarter, more community-driven conservation and recreation strategy. 
We are partnering with cities and States to make it easier for families 
to spend time outside no matter where they live, and we are working to 
create jobs, boost rural

[[Page 41]]

economies, and increase tourism by enhancing public lands that draw 
travelers from across the globe. To celebrate National Park Week, all 
397 National Parks will offer free admission from April 21 through April 
29, 2012. I encourage every American to visit www.NPS.gov to find a 
nearby park and discover the land passed down to us by our forebears.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt told us ``There is nothing so 
American as our National Parks.'' This week, we honor the uniquely 
American idea behind them: that each of us has an equal share in the 
land around us, and an equal responsibility to protect it. That call to 
conserve has echoed for generations--from Jefferson, to Lincoln, to 
Roosevelt, to all who have done their part to protect the land that they 
love. It is the call we hear today, and as we come together to celebrate 
our national heritage, let us reaffirm our promise to preserve America's 
treasures for the generations yet to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 21 through April 
29, 2012, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to visit 
their national parks and be reminded of these unique blessings we share 
as a Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8802 of April 20, 2012

Earth Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On April 22, 1970, millions of Americans came together to celebrate the 
first Earth Day. Students, teachers, activists, elected officials, and 
countless others challenged our Nation to confront our most urgent 
environmental issues and rallied around a single message: the success of 
future generations depends upon how we act today. As we commemorate 
Earth Day this year, we reflect on the challenges that remain before us 
and recommit to the spirit of togetherness and shared responsibility 
that galvanized a movement 42 years ago.
America rose to meet the call to action in the months and years that 
followed the first Earth Day. We passed the Clean Air, Clean Water, 
Endangered Species, and Marine Mammal Protection Acts; founded the 
Environmental Protection Agency; and ignited a spirit of stewardship 
that has driven progress for over four decades. Today, our air and water 
are cleaner, pollution has been greatly reduced, and Americans 
everywhere are living in a healthier environment.

[[Page 42]]

While we have made remarkable progress in protecting our health and our 
natural heritage, we know our work is not yet finished. Last July, my 
Administration proposed the toughest fuel economy standards in our 
Nation's history--standards that will save families money at the pump, 
cut greenhouse gas emissions, and significantly reduce our dependence on 
oil. In December, we finalized the first-ever national standards to 
limit mercury and other toxic emissions from power plants, helping 
safeguard the health of millions. We have taken action to protect and 
restore our Nation's precious ecosystems, from the Gulf Coast to the 
Great Lakes. And we continue to make landmark investments in batteries, 
biofuels, and renewable energy that are unlocking American innovation 
and ensuring our Nation stays on the cutting edge. Our country is on the 
path to economic recovery and renewal, and moving forward, my 
Administration will continue to fight for a healthy environment every 
step of the way.
As we work to leave our children a safe, sustainable future, we must 
also equip them with the tools they need to take on tomorrow's 
environmental challenges. Supporting environmental literacy and a strong 
foundation in science, technology, engineering, and math for every 
student will help ensure our youth have the skills and knowledge to 
advance our clean energy economy. Last year, we launched the Department 
of Education Green Ribbon Schools recognition award to encourage more 
schools to pursue sustainability, foster health and wellness, and 
integrate environmental literacy into the curriculum. In the days ahead, 
we look forward to awarding the first Green Ribbons and recognizing the 
accomplishments of green schools across our country.
Forty-two years ago, a generation rallied together to protect the earth 
we would inherit. As we reflect on that historic day of activism and 
stewardship, let us embrace our commitment to the generations yet to 
come by leaving them a safe, clean world on which to make their mark.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22, 2012, as 
Earth Day. I encourage all Americans to participate in programs and 
activities that will protect our environment and contribute to a 
healthy, sustainable future.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8803 of April 20, 2012

Establishment of the Fort Ord National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the heart of California's Central Coast, the former Fort Ord 
encompasses a sweeping landscape of vivid beauty and rich natural 
diversity. One of the

[[Page 43]]

few remaining expanses of large, contiguous open space in the 
increasingly developed Monterey Bay area, this area is a rolling 
landscape long treasured for recreation, scientific research, outdoor 
education, and historical significance. Originating in the Pleistocene 
Epoch, ancient dunes provide the foundation for this landscape's unique 
array of plant and wildlife communities. The area is also notable for 
its historical significance, including its role in the Spanish 
settlement of California and in the military training of generations of 
American soldiers.
Nearly two and a half centuries ago, as Americans fought for 
independence far to the east, these lands were traversed by a group of 
settlers led by Spanish Lieutenant Colonel Juan Bautista de Anza. In 
1775-1776, Anza established the first overland route from ``New Spain,'' 
as Mexico was then known, to San Francisco, opening the way for expanded 
Spanish settlement of California. The diaries kept on this nearly 2,000-
mile journey were used to identify the Juan Bautista de Anza National 
Historic Trail, approximately 6 miles of which pass through the Fort Ord 
area. Although much of the historic route currently passes through urban 
areas, the undeveloped expanse of the Fort Ord area is likely quite 
similar to the open landscape experienced by Anza and by the Costanoan 
(now commonly referred to as Ohlone) peoples who lived in what is now 
the Central Coast region of California.
The area's open, contiguous landscape owes its undeveloped state in 
large part to its role as a U.S. Army facility. From World War I through 
the early 1990s, the area's rugged terrain served as a military training 
ground and introduced as many as a million and a half American soldiers 
to the rigors of military service. From its origins in 1917 as a 
training ground for troops stationed at the nearby Presidio of Monterey, 
Fort Ord had grown into a major Army installation by the beginning of 
World War II. During the Vietnam War, it served as a leading training 
center and deployment staging ground. While the former Fort Ord has few 
remaining historic structures, today thousands of veterans carry the 
memory of its dramatic landscape as their first taste of Army life, as a 
final stop before deploying to war, or as a home base during their 
military career. These lands are an historical link to the heroism and 
dedication of the men and women who served our Nation and fought in the 
major conflicts of the 20th century.
Today, this expansive, historic landscape provides opportunities for 
solitude and adventure to nearly 100,000 visitors each year. By bicycle, 
horse, and foot visitors can explore the Fort Ord area's scenic and 
natural resources along trails that wind over lush grasslands, between 
gnarled oaks, and through scrub-lined canyons. Within the boundaries of 
the Fort Ord area, visitors admire the landscape and scenery and are 
exposed to wildlife and a diverse group of rare and endemic plants and 
animals. Because visitors travel from areas near and far, these lands 
support a growing travel and tourism sector that is a source of economic 
opportunity for the community, especially businesses in the region. They 
also help to attract new residents, retirees, and businesses that will 
further diversify the local economy.
Scientists are also drawn here, seeking out opportunities to better 
understand once-widespread species and vegetative communities, and their 
ongoing restoration. The Fort Ord area is significant because of its 
rich biodiversity and important Central Coast habitats, supporting a 
diverse group of rare and endemic species of plants and animals that are 
managed across

[[Page 44]]

the base through a multi-agency, community-led management plan. It is 
one of the few remaining places in the world where large expanses of 
coastal scrub and live oak woodland and savanna habitat, mixed with rare 
vernal pools, exist in a contiguous, interconnected landscape.
The protection of the Fort Ord area will maintain its historical and 
cultural significance, attract tourists and recreationalists from near 
and far, and enhance its unique natural resources, for the enjoyment of 
all Americans.
WHEREAS section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act''), authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled 
by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
WHEREAS the 1991 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission 
recommended that Fort Ord cease to be used as an Army installation, and 
pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Public 
Law 101-510), Fort Ord closed on September 30, 1994;
WHEREAS it is in the public interest to reserve such lands as a national 
monument to be known as the Fort Ord National Monument;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Antiquities 
Act, hereby proclaim that all lands and interests in lands owned or 
controlled by the Government of the United States within the boundaries 
described on the map entitled ``Fort Ord National Monument,'' which is 
attached to and forms a part of this proclamation, are hereby set apart 
and reserved as the Fort Ord National Monument (monument) for the 
purpose of protecting and restoring the objects identified above. The 
reserved Federal lands and interests in lands consist of approximately 
14,651 acres, which is the smallest area compatible with the proper care 
and management of the objects to be protected and restored.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of this 
monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, 
location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the 
public lands laws, including withdrawal from location, entry, and patent 
under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to 
mineral and geothermal leasing other than by exchange that furthers the 
protective purposes of the monument.
The establishment of this monument is subject to valid existing rights. 
Lands and interests in lands within the monument boundaries not owned or 
controlled by the United States shall be reserved as part of the 
monument upon acquisition of ownership or control by the United States.
Of the approximately 14,651 acres of Federal lands and interests in 
lands reserved by this proclamation, approximately 7,205 acres are 
currently managed by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM) and approximately 7,446 acres are currently 
managed by the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary of the Army, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, through the BLM, shall 
continue to manage

[[Page 45]]

the lands and interests in lands under the Secretary's jurisdiction 
within the monument boundaries until the Army transfers those lands and 
interests in lands to the BLM in accordance with the 1995 Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) between the Department of the Army and the BLM, as 
amended, that describes the responsibilities of each agency related to 
such lands and interests in lands, the implementing actions required of 
each agency, the process for transferring administrative jurisdiction 
over such lands and interests in lands to the Secretary of the Interior, 
and the processes for resolving interagency disputes. The Secretary of 
the Interior, through the BLM, shall manage that portion of the monument 
under the Secretary's administrative jurisdiction, pursuant to 
applicable legal authorities and the MOU, to implement the purposes of 
this proclamation.
For purposes of protecting and restoring the objects identified above, 
the Secretary of the Interior, through the BLM, shall prepare and 
maintain a transportation plan, in coordination with the Secretary of 
the Army and consistent with the MOU, that provides for visitor 
enjoyment and understanding of the scientific and historic objects on 
lands within the monument boundaries that are under the administrative 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior. The transportation plan 
shall include the designation of roads and trails for bicycling and 
other purposes. Except for emergency or authorized administrative 
purposes, under the transportation plan motorized vehicle use shall be 
permitted only on designated roads, and non-motorized mechanized vehicle 
use shall be permitted only on designated roads and trails. The plan 
shall be revised upon the transfer of lands now under the administrative 
jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army to the Secretary of the 
Interior in accordance with the MOU.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to enlarge or diminish the 
rights of any Indian tribe.
Nothing in this proclamation shall affect the responsibility of the 
Department of the Army under applicable environmental laws, including 
the remediation of hazardous substances or munitions and explosives of 
concern within the monument boundaries; nor affect the Department of the 
Army's statutory authority to control public access or statutory 
responsibility to make other measures for environmental remediation, 
monitoring, security, safety, or emergency preparedness purposes; nor 
affect any Department of the Army activities on lands not included 
within the monument. Nothing in this proclamation shall affect the 
implementation of the Installation-Wide Multispecies Habitat Management 
Plan for the former Fort Ord including interagency agreements 
implementing that plan.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to enlarge or diminish the 
jurisdiction of the State of California with respect to fish and 
wildlife management.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing 
withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall 
be the dominant reservation.
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, 
injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to 
locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.

Proclamation 8804 of April 23, 2012

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than three decades, advocates from every corner of America have 
worked to reinforce rights, services, and support for victims of crime. 
Our Nation stands stronger for their efforts. Today, thousands of victim 
assistance programs empower survivors with the tools to rebuild their 
lives. Yet, when only about half of all violent crimes are reported to 
the police and many victims struggle to secure the help they need, we 
know we must do more. This week, we rededicate ourselves to securing the 
full measure of justice for every crime victim, resolving disparities in 
our criminal justice system, and preventing crimes before they occur.
The incidence of crime in the United States is an affront to our 
national conscience and cannot be ignored. Millions of Americans 
experience violent or property crime victimization every year, and still 
more are impacted as they help a loved one in their hour of need. Sadly, 
children, seniors, persons with disabilities, immigrants, and 
traditionally underserved communities continue to experience 
disproportionately high rates of victimization. Moreover, women suffer 
the vast majority of intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and 
rape. These outcomes are deplorable, and we must come together to build 
communities where all people have the opportunity to live in safety and 
security.
My Administration is committed to realizing that vision. With leadership 
from the Department of Justice, we are investing in programs to prevent 
crime, drug abuse, and violence in communities across our Nation. We are 
partnering with organizations and agencies at every level of government 
to develop robust victim services, support law enforcement, and 
strengthen our criminal justice system. We issued a revised definition 
of rape that will shed new light on how often this crime occurs, and we 
continue to combat sexual violence and expand support for survivors. 
From disrupting human trafficking networks, to fighting financial fraud, 
to empowering the millions who are affected by crime every year, my 
Administration is working to bring more Americans the services and 
protection they deserve. For additional information, resources, and 
assistance, visit www.CrimeVictims.gov.
During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we commemorate the efforts 
of all who bring hope to crime victims during their darkest hour. As we 
reflect on the progress we have made toward ensuring fair treatment and 
full support for all crime victims, let us renew that fundamental 
American impulse to stand with those in need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22 through April 
28, 2012, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this week by participating in events that raise 
awareness of victims' rights and services, and by volunteering to serve 
victims in their time of need.

Proclamation 8805 of April 27, 2012

Workers Memorial Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For centuries, American workers have called upon boundless drive and 
initiative to raise our cities, manufacture our goods, and build an 
economy that remains the engine and the envy of the world. Generations 
put their lives on the line to pursue prosperity, braving the hazards of 
the factory floor and the heat of the fields without protective 
equipment or the right to a safe workplace. Through the unbending 
conviction of workers, labor unions, and public health advocates, we 
secured that basic right over 40 years ago, helping protect Americans 
from death or injury. Yet, despite the progress we have made, it remains 
a deplorable fact that an average of 12 individuals die on the job every 
day. On Workers Memorial Day, we honor all who have perished, and we 
recommit to ensuring no worker ever has to choose between life and a 
paycheck.
Every year, more than 3 million Americans are injured on the job. Some 
will never fully recover; some will never come home at all. Tragically, 
many incidents occur due to preventable hazards that cast our Nation's 
most vulnerable workers into harm's way--in the mine shaft, on the 
construction site, or at the factory. This is unacceptable, and as we 
reflect on the terrible burden these workers and their families have 
borne, we must do more to fulfill the promise of a safe workplace for 
all.
My Administration remains committed to realizing that vision. The 
Department of Labor and agencies across the Federal Government are 
striving to defend workers' rights, hold employers accountable, and 
empower Americans across our country with the tools they need to stay 
safe on the job. We are pursuing enhanced whistleblower protections that 
will reinforce every worker's right to raise their voice without fear of 
retaliation. Over 2 years after the explosion at Upper Big Branch Mine 
in West Virginia, we continue to advance and enforce new standards and 
programs that will help ensure that tragedy was the last of its kind. 
And, through a variety of public-private partnerships, we are 
collaborating with businesses, employees, trade associations, and labor 
organizations to eliminate workplace hazards and strengthen our 
competitiveness in the global economy.
When the Congress passed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 
1969 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, our Nation took 
great strides toward safe and healthful working conditions for all. Yet, 
when millions of Americans suffer workplace-related injury or illness 
every year, and thousands lose their lives, we know we cannot give up 
the fight. Today, we reflect on their sacrifice, and we rededicate 
ourselves to protecting the health, safety, and dignity of every worker.

[[Page 50]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 28, 2012, as 
Workers Memorial Day. I call upon all Americans to participate in 
ceremonies and activities in memory of those killed or injured due to 
unsafe working conditions.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8806 of May 1, 2012

Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) have helped 
make America what it is today. Their histories recall bitter hardships 
and proud accomplishments--from the laborers who connected our coasts 
one-and-a-half centuries ago, to the patriots who fought overseas while 
their families were interned at home, from those who endured the harsh 
conditions of Angel Island, to the innovators and entrepreneurs who are 
driving our Nation's economic growth in Silicon Valley and beyond. Asian 
American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month offers us an opportunity to 
celebrate the vast contributions Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
have made to our Nation, reflect on the challenges still faced by AAPI 
communities, and recommit to making the American dream a reality for 
all.
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders comprise many ethnicities and 
languages, and their myriad achievements embody the American experience. 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have started businesses, including 
some of our Nation's most successful and dynamic enterprises. AAPI men 
and women are leaders in every aspect of American life--in government 
and industry, science and medicine, the arts and our Armed Forces, 
education and sports.
Yet, while we celebrate these successes, we must remember that too often 
Asian American and Pacific Islanders face significant adversity. Many 
AAPI communities continue to fight prejudice and struggle to overcome 
disparities in education, employment, housing, and health care. My 
Administration remains committed to addressing these unique challenges. 
Through the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders, we are working to expand opportunities for AAPI communities 
by improving access to Federal programs where Asian American and Pacific 
Islanders are currently underserved. To learn more about the Initiative, 
visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/AAPI.
As we also take this occasion to reflect on our past, we mark 70 years 
since the Executive Order that authorized the internment of Japanese-
Americans during World War II. Last month, I announced my intent to 
posthumously

[[Page 51]]

award the Presidential Medal of Freedom--the country's highest civilian 
honor--to Gordon Hirabayashi, who openly defied this forced relocation, 
and bravely took his challenge all the way to the United States Supreme 
Court.
This year, we also commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first 
Japanese cherry blossom trees planted in Washington, D.C., an enduring 
symbol of the friendship shared between the United States and Japan and 
a reminder of America's standing as a Pacific nation. Over the 
centuries, we have maintained a long, rich history of engagement in the 
Asia-Pacific region, and our AAPI communities have been essential to 
strengthening the economic, political, and social bonds we share with 
our partners around the world.
This month, we reflect on the indelible ways AAPI communities have 
shaped our national life. As we celebrate centuries of trial and 
triumph, let us rededicate ourselves to making our Nation a place that 
welcomes the contributions of all people, all colors, and all creeds, 
and ensures the American dream is within reach for all who seek it.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2012 as Asian 
American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans 
to visit www.AsianPacificHeritage.gov to learn more about the history of 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8807 of May 1, 2012

National Building Safety Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In neighborhoods and workplaces across America, professionals throughout 
government and industry work to implement building safety solutions that 
strengthen resilience and meet community needs. By designing and 
implementing state-of-the-art building safety, energy efficiency, and 
fire prevention codes and standards, they help save lives and prevent 
disruption in the wake of disaster. Resilient infrastructure is 
essential to an America built to last, and during National Building 
Safety Month, we recommit to strengthening our Nation's ability to 
withstand the threats and hazards we face.
My Administration is committed to advancing that mission. With 
leadership from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, we continue to 
develop robust public-private partnerships that help communities prepare 
for, withstand, and recover from disasters. We are drawing upon cutting 
edge

[[Page 52]]

science and technology to establish stronger codes and standards for 
disaster resilience. And moving forward, we must promote research and 
development that will drive innovation in construction and retrofitting 
techniques. I encourage all Americans to visit www.Ready.gov to learn 
more about preparedness and find out how to get involved.
Whether protecting our communities from fires, floods, earthquakes, 
severe storms, or other disasters, building safety professionals play a 
critical role in making America safe, strong, and sustainable. This 
month, we celebrate their work, and we rededicate ourselves to ensuring 
our Nation remains ready and resilient.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2012 as National 
Building Safety Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, 
private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups 
to join in activities that will increase awareness of building safety, 
and I further urge Americans to learn more about how they can contribute 
to building safety at home and in their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8808 of May 1, 2012

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In July 1961, President John F. Kennedy remarked that ``the strength of 
our democracy and our country is really no greater in the final analysis 
than the well-being of our citizens.'' He envisioned a renewed national 
commitment to leading a more active and vigorous life--to pursuing 
health of mind and body in equal proportion. Over half a century later, 
that call to action still rings true. During National Physical Fitness 
and Sports Month, we rededicate ourselves to empowering Americans young 
and old with the tools to pursue a healthy lifestyle.
From the classroom to the court, countless Americans enrich their lives 
and their health by getting active. Regular physical activity promotes 
strong mental and physical development, builds lean muscle, and plays an 
essential role in maintaining a healthy weight. Coupled with nutritious 
meals, it can help prevent a wide variety of chronic diseases, including 
cancer, heart disease, and stroke--three leading causes of death in the 
United States. Yet, with inactivity and obesity continuing to put 
millions at risk, we know we must do more to help individuals, families, 
and communities across our Nation make exercise an easy, accessible part 
of daily life.

[[Page 53]]

My Administration is committed to realizing this vision. With First Lady 
Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative and the President's Council on 
Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, we are working to give more Americans 
the tools and information they need to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We 
are striving to ensure children have access to nutritious food at school 
and at home, and we are partnering with organizations across our country 
to help more Americans get active. To learn more about these 
initiatives, the President's Active Lifestyle Award, and how to get 
involved in your community, visit www.LetsMove.gov and www.Fitness.gov.
All of us can play a role in giving our children a strong start and 
ensuring a healthy future for our Nation. By coming together to exercise 
with friends or family, children and adults can support each other in 
living a more active life. Schools can bring more physical education 
into the curriculum before, during, or after the school day. And 
community leaders can promote physical activity by expanding safe routes 
for children to walk or ride a bike to school, revitalizing parks and 
playgrounds, and developing sports and fitness programs that are 
accessible to all. As we celebrate the progress we have made toward 
these goals, let us recommit to making positive change in our lives by 
eating healthy and embracing an active lifestyle.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2012 as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to make daily physical activity, sports participation, and good 
nutrition a priority in their lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8809 of May 1, 2012

Older Americans Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America endured great trials and heralded defining triumphs over the 
course of the 20th century, and the men and women who saw us through 
that time remain among our Nation's greatest assets. Through their 
guiding wisdom, enduring love of family, and inspiring commitment to 
country, older Americans continue to steer and enhance our national 
life.
Our seniors make countless contributions as active participants in 
communities across America. From our parks and schools to our faith and 
service organizations, the generosity and talents of active seniors 
augment our children's education, bring our families together, and 
strengthen the fabric of our society. This year's theme for Older 
Americans Month, ``Never Too Old to Play,'' celebrates the 
accomplishments of older Americans and encourages them to find even more 
ways to stay engaged. May 7 through May 11,

[[Page 54]]

2012, is also Senior Corps Week, when we celebrate the service of the 
over 300,000 Senior Corps volunteers. Individuals interested in 
information on local volunteer opportunities can visit 
www.SeniorCorps.gov.
As we honor the achievements and ongoing contributions of older 
Americans, my Administration is working with States, territories, and 
tribes to provide them with support to stay healthy, independent, and 
engaged. We remain deeply committed to strengthening Medicare, 
protecting Social Security, enhancing Older Americans Act programs, and 
implementing the historic Affordable Care Act, which provided more than 
32 million seniors with at least one free preventive service or wellness 
visit last year and helped over 5 million save more than $3.2 billion on 
prescription drug costs in 2010 and 2011. The Department of Health and 
Human Services recently awarded more than $1.3 billion in grants to 
ensure the health and independence of America's older adults, including 
$20 million focused on fitness, chronic disease self-management, and 
medication management. And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is 
safeguarding older Americans from unscrupulous financial schemes that 
threaten their fiscal security.
Our seniors have devoted their entire lives to building the future their 
children and grandchildren deserve. During Older Americans Month, we 
celebrate their successes and recommit to supporting them as they shape 
America's next great generation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2012 as Older 
Americans Month. I call upon all Americans of all ages to acknowledge 
the contributions of older Americans during this month and throughout 
the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8810 of May 1, 2012

Law Day, U.S.A., 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower established Law Day in 1958, he 
proclaimed it ``fitting that the people of this Nation should remember 
with pride and vigilantly guard the great heritage of liberty, justice, 
and equality under law which our forefathers bequeathed to us.'' Today, 
we celebrate that enduring legacy and renew our commitment to a 
democracy sustained by the rule of law.
This year's Law Day theme, ``No Courts, No Justice, No Freedom,'' 
recalls the historic role our courts have played in protecting the 
fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans. Our courts are the 
guarantors of civil

[[Page 55]]

justice, social order, and public safety, and we must do everything we 
can to enable their critical work. The courthouse doors must be open and 
the necessary services must be in place to allow all litigants, judges, 
and juries to operate efficiently. Likewise, we must ensure that access 
to justice is not an abstract theory, but a concrete commitment that 
delivers the promise of counsel and assistance for all who seek it.
Today, let us reflect upon the role generations of legal and judicial 
professionals have played in building an America worthy of the ideals 
that inspired its founding. The timeless principles of equal protection 
and due process remain at the heart of our democracy, and on Law Day, we 
recommit to upholding them not just in our time, but for all time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2012, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to 
acknowledge the importance of our Nation's legal and judicial systems 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and to display the flag of 
the United States in support of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8811 of May 1, 2012

Loyalty Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than two centuries ago, our Founders laid out a charter that 
assured the rule of law and the rights of man. Through times of 
tranquility and the throes of change, the Constitution has always guided 
our course toward fulfilling that most noble promise that all are equal, 
all are free, and all deserve the chance to pursue their full measure of 
happiness. America has carried on not only for the skill or vision of 
history's celebrated figures, but also for the generations who have 
remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our 
founding documents. On Loyalty Day, we reflect on that proud heritage 
and press on in the long journey toward prosperity for all.
In the years since our Constitution was penned and ratified, Americans 
have moved our Nation forward by embracing a commitment to each other, 
to the fundamental principles that unite us, and to the future we share. 
We weathered the storms of civil war and segregation, of conflicts that 
spanned continents. We overcame threats from within and without--from 
the specter of fascism abroad to the bitter injustice of 
disenfranchisement at home.

[[Page 56]]

We upheld the spirit of service at the core of our democracy, and we 
widened the circle of opportunity not just for a privileged few, but for 
the ambitious many. Time and again, men and women achieved what seemed 
impossible by joining imagination to common purpose and necessity to 
courage. That legacy still burns brightly, and the ideals it embodies 
remain a light to all the world.
Countless Americans demonstrate that same dedication to country today. 
It endures in the hearts of all who put their lives on the line to 
defend the land they love, just as it moves millions to improve their 
communities through volunteerism and civic participation. Their actions 
help ensure prosperity for this generation and those yet to come, and 
they honor the immutable truths enshrined in our Nation's founding 
texts. On Loyalty Day, we rededicate ourselves to the common good, to 
the cornerstones of liberty, equality, and justice, and to the unending 
pursuit of a more perfect Union.
In order to recognize the American spirit of loyalty and the sacrifices 
that so many have made for our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 85-
529 as amended, has designated May 1 of each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' On 
this day, let us reaffirm our allegiance to the United States of 
America, our Constitution, and our founding values.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2012, as Loyalty Day. This Loyalty 
Day, I call upon all the people of the United States to join in support 
of this national observance, whether by displaying the flag of the 
United States or pledging allegiance to the Republic for which it 
stands.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

National Day of Prayer, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Prayer has always been a part of the American story, and today countless 
Americans rely on prayer for comfort, direction, and strength, praying 
not only for themselves, but for their communities, their country, and 
the world.
On this National Day of Prayer, we give thanks for our democracy that 
respects the beliefs and protects the religious freedom of all people to 
pray, worship, or abstain according to the dictates of their conscience. 
Let us pray for all the citizens of our great Nation, particularly those 
who are sick, mourning, or without hope, and ask God for the sustenance 
to meet the challenges we face as a Nation. May we embrace the 
responsibility we have to each other, and rely on the better angels of 
our nature in service to one another. Let us be humble in our 
convictions, and courageous in our virtue.

[[Page 57]]

Let us pray for those who are suffering around the world, and let us be 
open to opportunities to ease that suffering.
Let us also pay tribute to the men and women of our Armed Forces who 
have answered our country's call to serve with honor in the pursuit of 
peace. Our grateful Nation is humbled by the sacrifices made to protect 
and defend our security and freedom. Let us pray for the continued 
strength and safety of our service members and their families. While we 
pause to honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice defending 
liberty, let us remember and lend our voices to the principles for which 
they fought--unity, human dignity, and the pursuit of justice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 3, 2012, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
invite all citizens of our Nation, as their own faith directs them, to 
join me in giving thanks for the many blessings we enjoy, and I call 
upon individuals of all faiths to pray for guidance, grace, and 
protection for our great Nation as we address the challenges of our 
time.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of

Proclamation 8813 of May 2, 2012

Jewish American Heritage Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Three hundred and fifty-eight years ago, a band of 23 Jewish refugees 
fled Recife, Brazil, beset by bigotry and oppression. For them, receding 
shores marked the end of another chapter of persecution for a people 
that had been tested from the moment they came together and professed 
their faith. Yet, they also marked a new beginning. When those men, 
women, and children landed in New Amsterdam--what later became New York 
City--they found not only safe haven, but early threads of a tradition 
of freedom and opportunity that would forever bind their story to the 
American story.
Those 23 believers led the way for millions to follow. During the next 
three centuries, Jews around the world set out to build new lives in 
America--a land where prosperity was possible, where parents could give 
their children more than they had, where families would no longer fear 
the specter of violence or exile, but live their faith openly and 
honestly. Even here, Jewish Americans bore the pains of hardship and 
hostility; yet, through every obstacle, generations carried with them 
the deep conviction that a better future was within their reach. In 
adversity and in success, they turned to one another, renewing the 
tradition of community, moral purpose, and shared struggle so integral 
to their identity.
Their history of unbroken perseverance and their belief in tomorrow's 
promise offers a lesson not only to Jewish Americans, but to all 
Americans.

[[Page 58]]

Generations of Jewish Americans have brought to bear some of our 
country's greatest achievements and forever enriched our national life. 
As a product of heritage and faith, they have helped open our eyes to 
injustice, to people in need, and to the simple idea that we might 
recognize ourselves in the struggles of our fellow men and women. These 
principles led Jewish advocates to fight for women's equality and 
workers' rights, and to preach against racism from the bimah; they 
inspired many to lead congregants on marches to stop segregation, help 
forge unbreakable bonds with the State of Israel, and uphold the ideal 
of ``tikkun olam''--our obligation to repair the world. Jewish Americans 
have served heroically in battle and inspired us to pursue peace, and 
today, they stand as leaders in communities across our Nation.
More than 300 years after those refugees first set foot in New 
Amsterdam, we celebrate the enduring legacy of Jewish Americans--of the 
millions who crossed the Atlantic to seek out a better life, of their 
children and grandchildren, and of all whose belief and dedication 
inspires them to achieve what their forebears could only imagine. Our 
country is stronger for their contributions, and this month, we 
commemorate the myriad ways they have enriched the American experience.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2012 as Jewish 
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to visit 
www.JewishHeritageMonth.gov to learn more about the heritage and 
contributions of Jewish Americans and to observe this month with 
appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of May, 
in the year two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of the United 
States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8814 of May 2, 2012

National Foster Care Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Childhood is a time for our young people to grow and learn, protected by 
their families and safe in their homes. But for almost half a million 
children who are unable to remain at home through no fault of their own, 
childhood can be a time of sadness, pain, and separation. These children 
need and deserve safe, loving, and permanent families who can help 
restore their sense of well-being and give them hope for the future.
During National Foster Care Month, we recognize the promise of America's 
children and youth in foster care, and we commend the devotion and 
selflessness of the foster parents who step in to care for them. We also 
pay tribute to the professionals nationwide who work to improve the 
safety of our most vulnerable children and assist their families in 
addressing the

[[Page 59]]

issues that brought them into the child welfare system. In communities 
across America, dedicated men and women--in schools, faith-based and 
community organizations, parent and advocacy groups--volunteer their 
time as mentors, tutors, and advocates for children in foster care. We 
all have a role to play in ensuring our children and youth grow up with 
the rich opportunities and support they need to reach their full 
potential.
My Administration is committed to increasing positive outcomes for every 
infant and child in foster care, and to promoting a successful 
transition to adulthood for older youth. We are working to increase 
permanency through reunification, adoption, and guardianship; to prevent 
maltreatment; to reduce rates of re-entry into foster care; and to 
ensure all qualified caregivers have the opportunity to serve as foster 
parents. Through the Child and Family Services Improvement and 
Innovation Act, we are granting States more flexibility in supporting a 
range of services for children in foster care, including health care and 
treatment of emotional trauma. And through the Affordable Care Act, 
beginning in 2014, every State will be required to extend Medicaid 
coverage up to age 26 for former foster youth.
This year also marks the 100th anniversary of the Children's Bureau, an 
agency within the Department of Health and Human Services that carries 
forward a legacy of protecting our Nation's children and strengthening 
families through programs like the Permanency Innovations Initiative. 
Over 5 years, this initiative is investing $100 million in new 
strategies to identify permanent homes for youth in long-term foster 
care, including more than 100,000 children awaiting adoption, and to 
reducing time spent in foster care placements.
National Foster Care Month is a time to reflect on the many ways 
government, social workers, foster families, religious institutions, and 
others are helping improve the lives of children in foster care, and it 
also serves as a reminder that we cannot rest until every child has a 
safe, loving, and permanent home. Together, we give thanks to those 
individuals from all walks of life who have opened their hearts and 
their homes to a child, and we rededicate ourselves to ensuring a bright 
and hopeful future for America's foster youth.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2012 as National 
Foster Care Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month by 
dedicating their time, love, and resources to helping youth in foster 
care, whether by taking time to mentor, lending a hand to a foster 
family, or taking an active role in their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8815 of May 7, 2012

National Charter Schools Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we share a responsibility to provide our children with a 
world-class education. By keeping our young people engaged in learning, 
we help them develop the skills and values that will not only guide them 
in life, but also prepare them to thrive in the global economy. For 
years, charter schools have brought new ideas to the work of educating 
our sons and daughters, and during National Charter Schools Week, we 
recognize their role in strengthening American education.
Whether created by parents and teachers or community and civic leaders, 
charter schools serve as incubators of innovation in neighborhoods 
across our country. These institutions give educators the freedom to 
cultivate new teaching models and develop creative methods to meet 
students' needs. This unique flexibility is matched by strong 
accountability and high standards, so underperforming charter schools 
can be closed, while those that consistently help students succeed can 
serve as models of reform for other public schools.
In an economy where knowledge is our most valuable asset, a good 
education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity--it is an 
imperative. Our children only get one chance at an education, and 
charter schools demonstrate what is possible when States, communities, 
teachers, parents, and students work together. This week, let us 
recommit to ensuring all our children receive a high-quality education 
that expands their horizons, inspires them to develop their talents, and 
instills in them a sense of possibility for their futures.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 6 through May 12, 
2012, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's charter 
schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and 
communities to support charter schools and the students they serve.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8816 of May 11, 2012

Military Spouse Appreciation Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than two centuries, our freedom has been safeguarded by brave 
patriots who have stepped forward and sworn an oath to defend the 
principles upon which our Republic was founded. Alongside these selfless 
heroes, our Nation's military spouses also offer tremendous service and 
make great sacrifices for our country. On Military Spouse Appreciation 
Day, we recognize the important role our military families play in 
keeping our Armed Forces strong and our country safe.
Our military spouses are a vital part of communities across America and 
around the world. We know them as our neighbors and friends, colleagues 
and coaches, teachers and nurses. They move from duty station to duty 
station, picking up their families and careers whenever their country 
asks. They keep their households running while dealing with the strain 
of deployment. They support our wounded warriors, preserve the legacies 
of our fallen, and find ways to give back to our country day after day.
The strength and readiness of America's military depends on the well-
being of our military spouses and families, and my Administration 
remains committed to ensuring they have the support and resources they 
deserve. Across Federal agencies, we have made major investments in 
education and childcare for military families, increased the 
availability of mortgage assistance to military homeowners, and extended 
new opportunities for veterans and their loved ones under the Post-9/11 
GI Bill.
Inspired by the stories of our military spouses' resilience and service, 
First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden launched the Joining Forces 
initiative to encourage all Americans to recognize, honor, and serve our 
military families. In only 1 year, Joining Forces has rallied American 
businesses to hire tens of thousands of veterans and military spouses, 
schools have improved educational opportunities for military children, 
and the medical community has vowed better care for military families. 
And from small towns to big cities, Americans have shown their gratitude 
by pledging hours of service and taking on projects that support 
military families in their communities. To learn more and get involved, 
visit www.JoiningForces.gov.
America's service members represent only one percent of our population, 
but they shoulder the responsibility of protecting our entire Nation and 
defending the ideals we hold dear. Just as we bear a sacred obligation 
to serve our men and women in uniform as well as they have served us, we 
share an equal responsibility to care for their extraordinary spouses 
who are heroes on the home front. On Military Spouse Appreciation Day, 
let us honor the unparalleled contributions of our military spouses and 
reaffirm our commitment to ensuring the priorities of our military 
families remain the priorities of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 11, 2012, as 
Military

[[Page 62]]

Spouse Appreciation Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8817 of May 11, 2012

Mother's Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Mothers are cornerstones of our families and our communities. On 
Mother's Day, we honor the remarkable women who strive and sacrifice 
every day to ensure their children have every opportunity to pursue 
their dreams.
Our Nation first came together to celebrate Mother's Day on May 11, 
1913, with the introduction of a House Resolution requesting President 
Woodrow Wilson, Members of Congress, and officials across the Federal 
Government wear white carnations in honor of America's mothers. Today, 
we continue to mark Mother's Day by paying tribute to the women who 
shape our characters and set our families up for success. Through their 
example, our children learn the principles of hard work, compassion, 
service, and personal responsibility. Through their encouragement and 
unconditional support, they instill the confidence and values so vital 
to our children's success.
Mothers raise children under an array of circumstances, and many work 
long hours inside and outside the home balancing myriad demands. Mothers 
are leaders and trailblazers in every part of our society--from 
classrooms to boardrooms, at home and overseas, on the beat and on the 
bench. We celebrate the efforts of all our Nation's mothers, and we 
recognize that when more households are relying on women as primary or 
co-breadwinners, the success of women in our economy is essential to the 
success of our families, our communities, and our country. That is why I 
created the White House Council on Women and Girls as one of my first 
acts in office--to ensure we integrate the needs of women and girls into 
every decision we make. I was proud to sign the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay 
Act, which continues to help women secure equal pay for equal work, and 
my Administration continues to promote workplace flexibility so no 
mother has to choose between her job and her child. And because of the 
Affordable Care Act, women finally have more power to make choices about 
their health care, and they have expanded access to a wide variety of 
preventive services such as mammograms at no additional cost.
Today, let us pay respect to mothers across America by embracing the 
women who continue to guide and inspire us, and by holding fast to the 
memories of those who live on in our hearts.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), 
has designated the second Sunday in May each year as ``Mother's Day'' 
and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.

[[Page 63]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 13, 2012, as Mother's Day. I urge all 
Americans to express love and gratitude to mothers everywhere, and I 
call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8818 of May 14, 2012

To Implement the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement and 
for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On November 22, 2006, the United States entered into the United 
States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (the ``Agreement'') and on 
June 28, 2007, the United States and Colombia amended the Agreement. The 
Congress approved the Agreement, as amended, in section 101(a) of the 
United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the 
``Implementation Act'') (Public Law 112-42, 125 Stat. 462).
2. Section 105(a) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office that 
shall be responsible for providing administrative assistance to panels 
established under chapter 21 of the Agreement.
3. Section 201 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such 
continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional 
duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to 
carry out or apply Articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, and 3.3.13 and Annex 2.3 of 
the Agreement.
4. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Implementation Act, Colombia 
is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary 
developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP).
5. Section 3103 of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act 
(title XXXI of the Trade Act of 2002, Public Law 107-210) (ATPDEA) 
amended section 204(b) of the Andean Trade Preference Act (19 U.S.C. 
3203(b)) (ATPA) to provide that certain preferential tariff treatment 
may be provided to eligible articles that are the product of any country 
that the President designates as an ``ATPDEA beneficiary country'' 
pursuant to section 204(b)(6)(B) of the ATPA, as amended. In 
Proclamation 7616 of October 31, 2002, Colombia and Peru were designated 
as beneficiary countries under the ATPDEA.
6. Consistent with section 201(a)(3) of the Implementation Act, Colombia 
is removed from the enumeration of beneficiary countries under the ATPA

[[Page 64]]

(19 U.S.C. 3202(a)(1)). Consequently, Colombia is also removed from the 
enumeration of beneficiary countries under the ATPDEA.
7. Consistent with section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2483), I have determined that other technical 
and conforming changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) are necessary to reflect that Colombia is no longer 
eligible to receive the benefits of the GSP, the ATPA, and the ATPDEA.
8. Section 201(d) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
take such action as may be necessary in implementing the tariff-rate 
quotas set forth in Appendix I to the General Notes to the Schedule of 
the United States to Annex 2.3 of the Agreement to ensure that imports 
of agricultural goods do not disrupt the orderly marketing of 
commodities in the United States.
9. Section 203 of the Implementation Act sets forth certain rules for 
determining whether a good is an originating good for the purpose of 
implementing preferential tariff treatment provided for under the 
Agreement. I have determined that it is necessary to include these rules 
of origin, together with particular rules applicable to certain other 
goods, in the HTS.
10. Section 203(o) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President, 
after receiving a request from an interested entity, to determine that a 
fabric, yarn, or fiber is or is not available in commercial quantities 
in a timely manner in Colombia or the United States; to establish 
procedures governing the submission of a request for any such 
determination and ensuring appropriate public participation in any such 
determination; to add to the list of the United States as set forth in 
Annex 3-B of the Agreement any fabric, yarn, or fiber determined to be 
not available in commercial quantities in a timely manner in Colombia 
and the United States; or to remove from the list in Annex 3-B of the 
Agreement any fabric, yarn, or fiber that the President has previously 
added to that list.
11. Section 208 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
take certain enforcement actions relating to trade with Colombia in 
textile and apparel goods.
12. Subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act authorizes the 
President to take certain actions in response to a request by an 
interested party for relief from serious damage or actual threat thereof 
to a domestic industry producing certain textile or apparel articles.
13. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established the 
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), 
consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, 
Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as 
Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. 
Consistent with section 301 of title 3, United States Code, when 
carrying out functions vested in the President by statute and assigned 
by the President to CITA, the officials collectively exercising those 
functions are all to be officers required to be appointed by the 
President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
14. Section 501(a) of the Implementation Act amended section 208(a) of 
the ATPA (19 U.S.C. 3206(a)) to extend the duration of duty-free 
treatment under the ATPA until July 31, 2013. I have determined that a 
modification to the HTS is necessary to reflect this amendment.

[[Page 65]]

15. Section 201 of the Omnibus Trade Act of 2010 (the ``Trade Act of 
2010'') (Public Law 111-344, 124 Stat. 3611), amended section 208(a)(1) 
of the ATPA (19 U.S.C. 3206(a)(1)) to provide that no duty-free 
treatment or other preferential treatment extended to beneficiary 
countries under the ATPA shall remain with respect to Peru after 
December 31, 2010. I have determined that a modification to the HTS is 
necessary to reflect this amendment. Consequently, Peru is removed from 
the enumeration of beneficiary countries under the ATPA and the ATPDEA.
16. Section 1952(a) of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 
(Public Law 104-188, 110 Stat. 1755) amended title V of the 1974 Act, to 
provide, in part, that the President may not designate as an eligible 
article under the GSP ``[t]extile and apparel articles which were not 
eligible articles for purposes of this title on January 1, 1994, as this 
title was in effect on such date.'' I have determined that a 
modification of general notes 4 and 10 to the HTS is necessary to 
reflect this amendment.
17. Presidential Proclamation 8332 of December 29, 2008, implemented 
U.S. tariff commitments under the United States-Oman Free Trade 
Agreement and incorporated by reference Publication 4050 of the United 
States International Trade Commission (the ``Commission''), entitled 
``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
Implementing the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement.'' Annex II to 
that publication included certain errors in the quantities specified 
under certain tariff-rate quotas and references to relevant tariff 
lines. I have determined that a modification to the HTS is necessary to 
correct those errors.
18. Presidential Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, modified certain 
rules of origin under the North American Free Trade Agreement and 
incorporated by reference Publication 4095 of the Commission, entitled 
``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
to Adjust Rules of Origin Under the North American Free Trade 
Agreement.'' Certain rules of origin were incorrectly deleted from the 
HTS. I have determined that a modification to general note 12 to the HTS 
is necessary to restore those rules of origin.
19. Presidential Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011, modified the 
HTS to conform to amendments made to the International Convention on the 
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System and incorporated by 
reference Publication 4276 of the Commission, entitled ``Modifications 
to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Under Section 
1206 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.'' Annex II to 
that publication included incorrect rates of duty for certain articles 
for the years 2016 through 2018. I have determined that a modification 
of general note 31 to the HTS is necessary to reflect the correct rate 
of duty for these articles.
20. Presidential Proclamation 8783 of March 6, 2012, implemented U.S. 
tariff commitments under the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement 
and incorporated by reference Publication 4308 of the Commission, 
entitled ``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States to Implement the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement.'' 
Annex II to that publication included an error in the staged duty 
applied to two tariff subheadings. I have determined that a modification 
to the HTS is necessary to correct that error.

[[Page 66]]

21. Section 604 of the 1974 Act authorizes the President to embody in 
the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of chapter V of that Act, 
and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken 
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 604 of the 1974 Act, section 1952(a) of the Small Business Job 
Protection Act of 1996, section 201 of the Trade Act of 2010, sections 
105(a), 201, 203, 208, 501, and subtitle B of title III of the 
Implementation Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and 
having made the determination under section 101(b) of the Implementation 
Act necessary for the exchange of notes, do hereby proclaim:

purposes of the Agreement, and to reflect Colombia's removal from the 
list of beneficiary developing countries under the GSP, and from the 
list of beneficiary countries under ATPA and ATPDEA, the HTS is modified

Proclamation 8819 of May 14, 2012

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the railroads that connected our continent in the 19th century to 
the highways that drove progress during the 20th, American 
infrastructure has fueled our Nation's growth for generations. Our 
roads, rails, runways, and shipyards have formed the foundation for a 
thriving global marketplace, and our transportation networks have 
enabled our first responders and service members to react with speed and 
efficiency during crisis. On National Defense Transportation Day and 
during National Transportation Week, we celebrate that rich legacy and 
recommit to building robust infrastructure that will accelerate our 
economy in the years ahead.
The need for strong and sustainable transportation networks has never 
been greater. While transportation systems across our country continue 
to connect millions of Americans to new economic opportunities, for too 
many businesses, the state of our roads and railways creates a 
competitive disadvantage that discourages investment and slows the pace 
of progress.

[[Page 69]]

Crumbling bridges put our safety at risk, and antiquated infrastructure 
limits our capacity to respond to threats, emergencies, and hazards at 
home and abroad. These situations diminish our security, our prosperity, 
and our resilience, and we must do more to address them.
That is why my Administration has prioritized strategic, long-term 
investments in transportation infrastructure that will keep America safe 
and ensure we can compete and succeed in the global economy. Through the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Transportation Investment 
Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grant program, all 50 
States have launched new highway and infrastructure projects, and many 
have funded passenger rail development that will modernize our cities 
and help put more construction workers back on the job. Moving forward, 
we remain committed to upgrading our infrastructure; ensuring the safety 
and security of our transportation systems; bringing diverse, 
sustainable transit opportunities to communities across our country; and 
investing in innovative solutions to address the transportation 
challenges of today and tomorrow.
An economy built to last depends on a world-class infrastructure system. 
This week, as we come together in pursuit of that critical goal, let us 
recall that as long as we are joined in common purpose and common 
resolve, our Nation remains strong, and our journey moves forward.
In recognition of the importance of our Nation's transportation 
infrastructure, and of the men and women who build, maintain, and 
utilize it, the Congress has requested, by joint resolution approved May 
16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), that the President designate the 
third Friday in May of each year as ``National Defense Transportation 
Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 
U.S.C. 133), that the week during which that Friday falls be designated 
as ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 18, 2012, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 13 through May 19, 2012, as National 
Transportation Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the 
importance of our Nation's transportation infrastructure and to 
acknowledge the contributions of those who build, operate, and maintain 
it.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.
BARACK OBAMA
Proclamation 8820 of May 14, 2012

National Women's Health Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Women have guided our country toward prosperity and progress, and our 
Nation's success depends on their well-being. While women often play a

[[Page 70]]

leading role in making medical decisions for their families, their own 
health care needs have too often gone unmet. During National Women's 
Health Week, we recommit to making health care more accessible and 
affordable for women across our country.
As President, I have made advancing gender equality in health care a top 
priority. Through the historic Affordable Care Act, we are reversing 
many of the worst abuses of the health insurance industry. Beginning in 
2014, many insurers will no longer be allowed to charge women higher 
premiums simply because of their gender, and it will be illegal for most 
insurance companies to deny coverage to women because they have a pre-
existing condition, including cancer or pregnancy. Health plans will 
also be required to cover maternity care. The law already enables women 
in new insurance plans to see any primary care provider or OB-GYN, or 
bring their children to any pediatrician in their health plan's network 
without a referral, and it prevents most insurance companies from 
denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions.
My Administration has fought to make preventive care accessible to all. 
Under the Affordable Care Act, we eliminated out-of-pocket costs for 
recommended preventive services such as mammograms, cervical cancer 
screenings, contraception, and well-woman visits under most plans. In 
2011 alone, more than 20 million women received expanded access to these 
services at no additional cost.
National Women's Health Week presents an opportunity for all women to 
prioritize their well-being by scheduling annual check-ups and 
screenings. To find more information on women's preventive care, visit 
www.WomensHealth.gov or www.GirlsHealth.gov.
As we celebrate the progress we have made, we recognize that American 
families cannot afford a return to the days when women were over-charged 
and denied access to critical services. During National Women's Health 
Week, let us move forward in pursuit of a fairer, healthier America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 13 through May 19, 
2012, as National Women's Health Week. I encourage all Americans to 
celebrate the progress we have made in protecting women's health and to 
promote awareness, prevention, and educational activities that improve 
the health of all women.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8821 of May 14, 2012

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, public safety officers work tirelessly to protect our 
citizens, enforce our laws, and keep our neighborhoods safe. They report 
for duty knowing full well the dangers they face and the sacrifices they 
may be called upon to make. This week, we pay tribute to the thousands 
of men and women who serve us with extraordinary bravery, and we 
remember the heroes who have laid down their lives in pursuit of a 
safer, more just society.
While we can never fully repay them for their service, we must work to 
ensure our law enforcement officers are equipped with the tools and 
technology they need to do their jobs safely and effectively. My 
Administration has devoted significant resources to improving officer 
safety, providing bulletproof vests that have saved lives, training 
officers to prevent and survive potentially lethal encounters, and 
strengthening our ability to share information. We also continue to 
pursue our goal of deploying a nationwide wireless network for public 
safety. For the first time, this new system will give our Nation's 
police officers and first responders a dedicated communication network 
in times of crisis--helping fulfill our promise to provide these brave 
men and women with tools worthy of the sacrifices they make on our 
behalf.
We owe a profound debt to all those who have worn the badge, and to the 
families whose care enables them to serve with courage and pride. When 
the unthinkable happens and officers give their lives or are seriously 
injured in the line of duty, we have an obligation to give their loved 
ones the support they deserve. During Peace Officers Memorial Day and 
Police Week, we recall the selflessness of our law enforcement officers 
and their families, and we honor all those who devote their lives to 
forging a stronger, safer America. Let us reflect on their invaluable 
contributions as we enjoy the peace they bring to our communities, and 
let us vow that their service will never be taken for granted.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 
676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the 
President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each 
year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the week in which it falls 
as ``Police Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2012, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 13 through May 19, 2012, as Police Week. I call upon all 
Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. I also call on Governors of the United States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject 
to the jurisdiction of the United States, and appropriate officials of 
all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff 
on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to 
display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that 
day.

Proclamation 8822 of May 14, 2012

150th Anniversary of the United States Department of Agriculture

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On May 15, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation to 
establish the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and 
codified a commitment to the health of our people and our land. One 
hundred and fifty years later, USDA continues to realize that vision of 
service by applying sound public policy and science to an evolving food 
and agriculture system.
The USDA has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the American people for 
generations. During the Great Depression, the Department helped bring an 
end to the Dust Bowl by promoting soil conservation. Through two World 
Wars, the Victory Garden Program fed troops and families around the 
world. The USDA worked to bring electric power to rural communities, 
establish the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and School Lunch 
Programs, implement our Nation's food safety regulations, and protect 
our forests and private lands. For one-and-a-half centuries, USDA has 
empowered communities across our country and helped ensure we leave our 
children a future rich with promise and possibility.
Today, USDA continues to serve the public interest by providing 
leadership on agriculture, natural resources, safe and nutritious food, 
research, and a broad spectrum of related issues. With partners across 
the public sector and throughout industry, USDA is working to develop 
and expand markets for agricultural products, grow our businesses and 
our economy, and protect the quality of our food supply and our 
environment. As part of the White House Rural Council, the Department is 
striving to expand opportunity for millions of families by promoting job 
growth and investing in infrastructure that will drive progress in the 
21st century. Through the Feed the Future initiative, USDA is supporting 
America's commitment to combat hunger and improve food security 
worldwide. And with the America's Great Outdoors initiative, USDA is 
supporting community-based conservation initiatives that will preserve 
our natural heritage for generations to come.
As we commemorate this historic milestone, we pay tribute to the men and 
women of USDA, past and present, who have faithfully served our Nation 
for 150 years. For their commitment, our fields grow richer, our 
abundance grows greater, and our country stands stronger.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

[[Page 73]]

the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2012, as the 
150th Anniversary of the United States Department of Agriculture. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities that honor the United States Department of 
Agriculture for its lasting contributions to the welfare of our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8823 of May 18, 2012

Armed Forces Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

With every assignment and in every theater, America's men and women in 
uniform perform their duties with the utmost dignity, honor, and 
professionalism. Through their dauntless courage and dedication, they 
live up to our Nation's highest ideals in even the most perilous 
circumstances. On Armed Forces Day, we pay tribute to the unparalleled 
service of our Armed Forces and recall the extraordinary feats they 
accomplish in defense of our Nation.
As individuals, our service members set extraordinary examples of 
character for those whose freedom they protect. Together, they comprise 
the greatest force for freedom and security the world has ever known. 
From their earliest training to the thick of battle, they look to those 
with whom they stand shoulder-to-shoulder, knowing they rise and fall as 
one team. United in their love of country, they teach us the true 
meaning of words like duty, honor, and strength.
Not just leaders and troops, patriots and heroes, the members of our 
Armed Forces are also parents, spouses, partners, sons, and daughters. 
Their families are just as vital to their success as their brothers and 
sisters in arms, and our debt of gratitude extends to them as well. As 
we celebrate the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen 
who make our way of life possible, we also pay our deepest respect to 
their families, our missing, our wounded, and our fallen. Inspired by 
their service and humbled by their sacrifice, let us recommit to 
providing all those who have served our Nation the support they deserve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United 
States, continuing the precedent of my predecessors in office, do hereby 
proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.
I direct the Secretary of Defense on behalf of the Army, Navy, Air 
Force, and Marine Corps, and the Secretary of Homeland Security on 
behalf of the Coast Guard, to plan for appropriate observances each 
year, with the Secretary of Defense responsible for encouraging the 
participation and cooperation of civil authorities and private citizens.

[[Page 74]]

I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to 
provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction 
each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public 
understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States. 
I also invite veterans, civic leaders, and organizations to join in the 
observance of Armed Forces Day.
Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United 
States at their homes on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn 
more about military service by attending and participating in the local 
observances of the day. I also encourage Americans to volunteer at 
organizations that provide support to our troops.
Proclamation 8681 of May 20, 2011, is hereby superseded.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8824 of May 21, 2012

Emergency Medical Services Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Day and night, in communities across our country, men and women 
providing emergency medical services (EMS) stand at the front lines of 
our public safety and public health systems, ready to respond with care 
and efficiency at a moment's notice. During Emergency Medical Services 
Week, we honor their essential contributions to our health and safety, 
and we recommit to supporting all EMS personnel as they carry out their 
courageous work.
Representing a diverse array of professions and skill sets, EMS 
practitioners are united by their devotion to building a stronger, more 
resilient Nation. They serve in both the public and private sectors--
from the first responders, emergency medical technicians, and paramedics 
who arrive at the scene to 911 dispatchers, firefighters, law 
enforcement officers, and professionals throughout our health care 
system who work together to ensure those in need receive the highest 
level of emergency service. Thousands of Americans have dedicated their 
careers to saving lives as EMS practitioners; thousands more serve as 
volunteers, going above and beyond to sustain the health and safety of 
their communities. As they tirelessly pursue that critical mission, my 
Administration remains committed to working with partners across 
government and industry to strengthen our EMS system and bolster 
preparedness in homes and hospitals across America.
Emergency medical services personnel demonstrate a profound commitment 
to our country and to our common humanity. Day after day, they answer 
the call to serve--to step into crisis and spark hope where it grows 
dim. This week, let us pay tribute to these selfless individuals and 
renew

[[Page 75]]

our promise to provide them with the support and services they need to 
protect their communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 20 through May 26, 
2012, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Americans to 
observe this occasion by sharing their support with their local EMS 
providers and taking steps to improve their personal safety and 
preparedness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8825 of May 21, 2012

National Safe Boating Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For generations, Americans have enjoyed our scenic lakes, rivers, and 
oceans as places for rest and recreation, sharing with friends and 
family a well-loved tradition. During National Safe Boating Week, we 
renew our commitment to safe, responsible practices on our Nation's 
waterways.
By planning ahead and taking basic safety precautions, boat operators 
and passengers can help prevent needless accidents and deaths. Before 
going out on the water, boaters can minimize the risk of accident or 
injury by taking a boating safety course, performing a vessel safety 
check, filing a float plan with a friend or family member prior to 
departure, and carefully assessing weather conditions. Operators and 
passengers alike can stay safe by wearing a life jacket at all times, 
and by forgoing alcohol consumption while on or operating a boat.
The United States Coast Guard continues to collaborate with 
organizations and governments across our country to prevent loss of 
life, personal harm, and property damage associated with unsafe 
recreational boating. As we mark National Safe Boating Week, let us 
reflect on that important mission and resolve to do our part to ensure 
America's waterways are safe and secure for all.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe 
Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 19 through May 25, 2012, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating 
activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating 
practices and taking advantage of boating education.

Proclamation 8826 of May 21, 2012

National Small Business Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For centuries, America's progress has been driven by pioneers who think 
big, take risks, and work hard. Where their ideas take root, we find 
inventions that can change the way we live. And when their businesses 
take off, they fuel an engine of economic growth and job creation that 
moves America forward. During National Small Business Week, we celebrate 
the generations of entrepreneurs who have given their all to realize a 
dream, and we renew our promise to help their businesses grow, hire, and 
succeed.
Because small businesses are the backbone of our economy, we must ensure 
our country recovers and rebuilds not only from the top down, but also 
from the bottom up and the middle out. That is how we will forge an 
America built to last, and that is why my Administration continues to 
widen the circle of opportunity for our workers and our businesses. 
Since I took office, we have repeatedly cut taxes for small businesses 
and expanded access to the capital they need to thrive. We launched the 
Startup America initiative, which has connected entrepreneurs to 
mentorship opportunities, cut red tape that would limit their success, 
and accelerated innovation in critical industries like health care, 
clean energy, and education. I was proud to sign the America Invents 
Act, which is helping entrepreneurs and businesses bring their 
inventions to market as quickly as possible. Through the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Small Business Jobs Act, the Small 
Business Administration has supported over $70 billion in lending to 
small businesses nationwide, and agencies across my Administration have 
taken action to make Government a more effective resource for 
entrepreneurs.
Yet, when Americans who want to work cannot find a job, we know we must 
do more. Last month, I was proud to sign the Jumpstart Our Business 
Startups Act, a bipartisan bill that enables ordinary Americans to 
invest in entrepreneurs they believe in. I was also proud to announce 
the Small Business Network of the Americas and the Women's 
Entrepreneurship in the Americas initiative, which--coupled with new 
Free Trade Agreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama--will help unlock 
new markets for companies of all sizes, expand small business exports, 
and support the broad-based economic growth that is essential to our 
prosperity. And earlier this year, we launched Business USA--a new 
online platform to give businesses full access to the resources they 
need at every stage of development. Moving forward, we will continue to 
promote tax reform to ease burdens on small businesses and 
entrepreneurs. And we will seek out new ways to help our companies grow 
by opening up the global marketplace,

[[Page 77]]

leveling the playing field, and forging strong partnerships between 
government and private enterprise.
Our Nation has always believed that anyone with a solid plan and a 
willingness to work hard can turn even an improbable idea into a 
successful business. For generations, that powerful notion has been at 
the heart of the American promise, forging a legacy of bold 
entrepreneurship that lives on today and lights the path to a brighter 
tomorrow. During National Small Business Week, let us reflect on that 
proud history and resolve to carry it forward in the years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 20 through May 26, 
2012, as National Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to 
recognize the contributions of small businesses to the competitiveness 
of the American economy with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8827 of May 21, 2012

World Trade Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America has always been a Nation of doers, makers, growers, and 
builders. Empowered by innovative universities, pioneering 
entrepreneurs, and productive workers, we have met a global demand for 
goods and services designed and produced by Americans. During World 
Trade Week, we reaffirm the essential role exports play in creating jobs 
and growing our economy.
Two years ago, my Administration launched the National Export Initiative 
with the goal of doubling our exports by the end of 2014. We continue to 
make historic progress toward achieving this goal; last year, exports 
surpassed $2.1 trillion in value for the first time in our history. This 
kind of growth protects and creates jobs here at home, helping 
individuals, families, and entire communities prosper.
We are determined to do everything in our power to sustain this 
momentum. Last year, I signed legislation to implement three trade 
agreements that will make it easier for American companies, farmers, and 
ranchers to sell their products in Korea, Panama, and Colombia. These 
agreements will support tens of thousands of American jobs, generate 
billions of dollars in additional exports, and help level the playing 
field to ensure our businesses can compete and succeed in the global 
marketplace. To ensure competitors play by the rules, we created the 
Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, which will aggressively 
investigate unfair trade practices taking place anywhere in the world. 
These and other measures will help maintain

[[Page 78]]

our Nation's competitive edge in a challenging and evolving global 
economy.
Because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside the United 
States, we must continue to look beyond our borders--from Beijing to 
Bogota--to open new markets for American exporters. As we work to expand 
economic opportunity here at home, we are reminded how three proud 
words, ``Made in America,'' will ensure our next generation inherits an 
economy built to last.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 20 through May 26, 
2012, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate 
and inform Americans about the benefits of trade to our Nation and the 
global economy.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8828 of May 22, 2012

National Maritime Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For 237 years, the men and women of the United States Merchant Marine 
have risen to meet our country's call. They have strengthened our 
economy and our security in times of calm and conflict, connecting our 
service members to the supplies they need and transporting our exports 
into the global marketplace. On National Maritime Day, we pay tribute to 
all those who have served and sacrificed on our waterways and around the 
world.
From privateers who bravely fought for American independence to mariners 
who have supported our Armed Forces for over two centuries, the United 
States Merchant Marine carries forward an enduring legacy of service to 
our Nation. In the War of 1812, mariners put their lives on the line to 
preserve our young Republic, engaging British warships with sloops and 
schooners off our Atlantic coast. During World War II, they executed 
perilous transits to support our troops in combat. And throughout the 
20th century and into the 21st, Merchant Mariners have contributed to 
the defense of our Nation by transporting essential cargo to ports 
across the globe. Their commitment has helped deliver us through periods 
of conflict, and their service will remain a critical asset to our 
security in the years ahead.
Our maritime industry also sustains the robust domestic and 
international trade networks that power our economy. As we open up new 
markets for American exports and support our businesses here at home, 
the United States Merchant Marine will continue to play a vital role in 
driving progress and prosperity in communities across our country. 
Today, we

[[Page 79]]

commemorate that important work, and we honor the mariners who dedicate 
their lives to seeing it through.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day,'' and has 
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2012, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance and to 
display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their 
communities. I also request that all ships sailing under the American 
flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8829 of May 25, 2012

Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As we observe the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, we reflect with 
solemn reverence upon the valor of a generation that served with honor. 
We pay tribute to the more than 3 million servicemen and women who left 
their families to serve bravely, a world away from everything they knew 
and everyone they loved. From Ia Drang to Khe Sanh, from Hue to Saigon 
and countless villages in between, they pushed through jungles and rice 
paddies, heat and monsoon, fighting heroically to protect the ideals we 
hold dear as Americans. Through more than a decade of combat, over air, 
land, and sea, these proud Americans upheld the highest traditions of 
our Armed Forces.
As a grateful Nation, we honor more than 58,000 patriots--their names 
etched in black granite--who sacrificed all they had and all they would 
ever know. We draw inspiration from the heroes who suffered unspeakably 
as prisoners of war, yet who returned home with their heads held high. 
We pledge to keep faith with those who were wounded and still carry the 
scars of war, seen and unseen. With more than 1,600 of our service 
members still among the missing, we pledge as a Nation to do everything 
in our power to bring these patriots home. In the reflection of The 
Wall, we see the military family members and veterans who carry a pain 
that may never fade. May they find peace in knowing their loved ones 
endure, not only in medals and memories, but in the hearts of all 
Americans, who are forever grateful for their service, valor, and 
sacrifice.
In recognition of a chapter in our Nation's history that must never be 
forgotten, let us renew our sacred commitment to those who answered our

[[Page 80]]

country's call in Vietnam and those who awaited their safe return. 
Beginning on Memorial Day 2012, the Federal Government will partner with 
local governments, private organizations, and communities across America 
to participate in the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the 
Vietnam War--a 13-year program to honor and give thanks to a generation 
of proud Americans who saw our country through one of the most 
challenging missions we have ever faced. While no words will ever be 
fully worthy of their service, nor any honor truly befitting their 
sacrifice, let us remember that it is never too late to pay tribute to 
the men and women who answered the call of duty with courage and valor. 
Let us renew our commitment to the fullest possible accounting for those 
who have not returned. Throughout this Commemoration, let us strive to 
live up to their example by showing our Vietnam veterans, their 
families, and all who have served the fullest respect and support of a 
grateful Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 28, 2012, through 
November 11, 2025, as the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the 
Vietnam War. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to honor 
our Vietnam veterans, our fallen, our wounded, those unaccounted for, 
our former prisoners of war, their families, and all who served with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every year, hurricanes put communities at risk of catastrophic damage 
from storm surges, flooding, high winds, and tornadoes. During National 
Hurricane Preparedness Week, we rededicate ourselves to preventing loss 
of life and damage to property by raising awareness about hurricane 
hazards and taking action to protect our families, our homes, and our 
neighborhoods.
My Administration is working hand-in-hand with communities and State and 
local officials to take necessary steps to prepare before storms strike. 
With the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National 
Hurricane Center, we continue to advance accurate tropical storm 
forecasting that gives individuals more time to get out of harm's way. 
And through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, we are 
collaborating with partners across all levels of government and 
throughout the private and non-profit sectors to develop robust systems 
for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. By engaging voices 
not only at the State and national levels, but also within 
neighborhoods, we empower communities

[[Page 81]]

across America to identify their unique needs and existing resources 
that may be used to address them.
A community-based approach to emergency management begins with an 
informed public. This week, I encourage all Americans living in areas 
that could be impacted by a hurricane to prepare by creating an 
emergency supply kit, learning evacuation routes, and developing a 
family communications plan to help ensure loved ones can find one 
another before and after a severe storm. If a hurricane is approaching, 
take shelter immediately, follow the directions of State and local 
officials, and evacuate if instructed. To learn more and find additional 
resources on how to prepare for and respond to severe weather, visit 
www.Ready.gov and www.Weather.gov.
As we mark the beginning of hurricane season, let us recommit to 
ensuring the safety of our loved ones and our communities, and to 
building a stronger, more resilient Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 27 through June 2, 
2012, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government 
agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in the 
coastal areas of our Nation to share information about hurricane 
preparedness and response to help save lives and protect communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation endures and thrives because of the devotion of our men and 
women in uniform, who, from generation to generation, carry a burden 
heavier than any we may ever know. On Memorial Day, we honor those who 
have borne conflict's greatest cost, mourn where the wounds of war are 
fresh, and pray for a just, lasting peace.
The American fabric is stitched with the stories of sons and daughters 
who gave their lives in service to the country they loved. They were 
patriots who overthrew an empire and sparked revolution. They were 
courageous men and women who strained to hold a young Union together. 
They were ordinary citizens who rolled back the creeping tide of 
tyranny, who stood post through a long twilight struggle, who saw terror 
and extremism threaten our world's security and said, ``I'll go.'' And 
though their stories are unique to the challenges they faced, our fallen 
service members are forever bound by a legacy of valor older than the 
Republic itself. Now they lay at rest in quiet corners of our country 
and the world, but they live on in the

[[Page 82]]

families who loved them and in the soul of a Nation that is safer for 
their service.
Today, we join together in prayer for the fallen. We remember all who 
have borne the battle, whose devotion to duty has sustained our country 
and kept safe our heritage as a free people in a free society. Though 
our hearts ache in their absence, we find comfort in knowing that their 
legacy lives on in all of us--in the security that lets us live in 
peace, the prosperity that allows us to pursue our dreams, and the love 
that still beats in those who knew them. May God bless the souls of the 
venerable warriors we have lost, and may He watch over the men and women 
who serve us now. Today, tomorrow, and in perpetuity, let us give thanks 
to them by remaining true to the values and virtues for which they 
fight.
In honor of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint 
resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has 
requested the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of 
the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for 
permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 
106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time 
for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of 
Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 28, 2012, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.
I request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, 
to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this 
Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the 
United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I 
also request the people of the United States to display the flag at 
half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

African-American Music Appreciation Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a long-cherished piece of American culture, music offers a vibrant 
soundtrack to the story of our people and our Union. At times when words 
alone could not bring us together, we have found in melodies and 
choruses the universal truths of our shared humanity. African-American 
musicians

[[Page 83]]

have left an indelible mark on this tradition, and during African-
American Music Appreciation Month, we pay special tribute to their 
extraordinary contributions.
Generations of African Americans have used music to share joy and pain, 
triumph and sorrow. Spiritual hymns gave hope to those laboring under 
the unrelenting cruelty of slavery, while gospel-inspired freedom songs 
sustained a movement for justice and equality for all. The smooth sounds 
of jazz and the soulful strain of the blues fed a renaissance in art and 
prose. The rhythm and blues that began in a basement in Detroit brought 
people together when laws would have kept them apart, while the urban 
beats and young wordsmiths from cities coast-to-coast gave voice to a 
new generation. And on stages and in concert halls around the world, 
African-American singers and composers have enhanced opera, symphony, 
and classical music by bringing energy and creativity to traditional 
genres.
At its core, African-American music mirrors the narrative of its 
original creators--born of humble beginnings and raised to refuse the 
limitations and circumstances of its birth. This month, we honor the 
African-American musicians, composers, singers, and songwriters who have 
forever shaped our musical heritage, and celebrate those who carry this 
rich legacy forward.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2012 as African-
American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month 
with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and foster 
appreciation of music that is composed, arranged, or performed by 
African Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Great Outdoors Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's natural treasures and unique landscapes have always mirrored 
the rugged independence and cherished diversity that define our national 
character. From rocky coasts to lush woodlands to urban parks, our great 
outdoors have set the scene for countless adventures, trials, and 
triumphs. During Great Outdoors Month, we celebrate our long legacy of 
environmental stewardship and resolve to preserve clean and healthy 
outdoor spaces for generations to come.
Thanks to centuries of forward-thinking Americans--from leaders like 
Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt to private citizens 
and neighborhood groups--our lives have been enriched by a tremendous

array of natural beauty. To uphold this tradition, I was proud to launch 
the America's Great Outdoors Initiative. Building on input from tens of 
thousands of people across our country, we are joining with communities, 
landowners, sportsmen, businesses, and partners at every level of 
government to reconnect Americans with the natural world and lay the 
foundation for a more sustainable planet. Through the Initiative, we are 
also helping support farms and ranches that provide our Nation with 
food, fiber, and energy. The 21st Century Conservation Service Corps is 
empowering our Nation's youth to restore and protect our public lands 
and waters through meaningful jobs and service opportunities. And First 
Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move Outside! initiative is encouraging 
children and families to explore the outdoors and engage in outdoor 
recreation as part of a healthy, active lifestyle.
Protecting our environment is not only a duty to our children; it is an 
economic imperative. Visitors to our public lands contribute billions of 
dollars to local economies, and I am committed to supporting this engine 
of growth. As part of our National Travel and Tourism Strategy, my 
Administration is working to increase visits to our national parks and 
scenic places. This initiative will help support small businesses and 
drive job growth across our country.
Great Outdoors Month is a time for all Americans to share in the natural 
splendor of which we are all proud inheritors. Whether camping, fishing, 
rock climbing, or playing in a neighborhood park, nature offers each of 
us the opportunity to get active, explore, and strengthen our bonds with 
family and friends. This month, let us celebrate our natural heritage by 
experiencing it together.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2012 as Great 
Outdoors Month. I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors and 
to uphold our Nation's legacy of conserving our lands and waters for 
future generations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8834 of June 1, 2012

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From generation to generation, ordinary Americans have led a proud and 
inexorable march toward freedom, fairness, and full equality under the 
law--not just for some, but for all. Ours is a heritage forged by those 
who organized, agitated, and advocated for change; who wielded love 
stronger than hate and hope more powerful than insult or injury; who 
fought to

[[Page 85]]

build for themselves and their families a Nation where no one is a 
second-class citizen, no one is denied basic rights, and all of us are 
free to live and love as we see fit.
The lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community has written 
a proud chapter in this fundamentally American story. From brave men and 
women who came out and spoke out, to union and faith leaders who rallied 
for equality, to activists and advocates who challenged unjust laws and 
marched on Washington, LGBT Americans and allies have achieved what once 
seemed inconceivable. This month, we reflect on their enduring legacy, 
celebrate the movement that has made progress possible, and recommit to 
securing the fullest blessings of freedom for all Americans.
Since I took office, my Administration has worked to broaden 
opportunity, advance equality, and level the playing field for LGBT 
people and communities. We have fought to secure justice for all under 
the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and 
we have taken action to end housing discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. We expanded hospital visitation rights 
for LGBT patients and their loved ones, and under the Affordable Care 
Act, we ensured that insurance companies will no longer be able to deny 
coverage to someone just because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or 
transgender. Because we understand that LGBT rights are human rights, we 
continue to engage with the international community in promoting and 
protecting the rights of LGBT persons around the world. Because we 
repealed ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'' gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans 
can serve their country openly, honestly, and without fear of losing 
their jobs because of whom they love. And because we must treat others 
the way we want to be treated, I personally believe in marriage equality 
for same-sex couples.
More remains to be done to ensure every single American is treated 
equally, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Moving 
forward, my Administration will continue its work to advance the rights 
of LGBT Americans. This month, as we reflect on how far we have come and 
how far we have yet to go, let us recall that the progress we have made 
is built on the words and deeds of ordinary Americans. Let us pay 
tribute to those who came before us, and those who continue their work 
today; and let us rededicate ourselves to a task that is unending--the 
pursuit of a Nation where all are equal, and all have the full and 
unfettered opportunity to pursue happiness and live openly and freely.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2012 as Lesbian, 
Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month. I call upon the people of 
the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to 
celebrate the great diversity of the American people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8835 of June 1, 2012

National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Individuals and families from Caribbean countries have journeyed to 
America's shores for centuries. Some were brought here against their 
will in the bonds of slavery. Some immigrated to America as children, 
clutching a parent's hand. Others came as adults, leaving behind 
everything they knew in pursuit of a better life in a new world. 
Generations of Caribbean Americans have sought to ensure their children 
and grandchildren would have the freedom to make of their lives what 
they will, and during National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we 
celebrate their rich narratives and recognize their immeasurable 
contributions to our country.
Caribbean Americans have shaped every aspect of our society--enhancing 
our arts and humanities as titans of music and literature, spurring our 
economy as intrepid entrepreneurs, making new discoveries as scientists 
and engineers, serving as staunch advocates for social and political 
change, and defending our ideals at home and abroad as leaders in our 
military. Their achievements exemplify the tenacity and perseverance 
embedded in our national character, and their stories embody the 
fundamental American idea that when access to opportunity is equal, 
anyone can make it if they try.
As we reflect on the myriad ways Caribbean Americans have shaped our 
country, we join in commemorating the 50th anniversaries of independence 
in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, and we reaffirm the bonds of 
friendship we share with our Caribbean neighbors. This month, let us 
celebrate the essence of the Nation we all love--an America where so 
many of our ancestors have come from somewhere else; a society that has 
been enriched by cultures from around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2012 as National 
Caribbean-American Heritage Month. I encourage all Americans to 
celebrate the history and culture of Caribbean Americans with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8836 of June 1, 2012

National Oceans Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our oceans help feed our Nation, fuel our economic engine, give mobility 
to our Armed Forces, and provide a place for rest and recreation. 
Healthy oceans, coasts, and waterways are among our most valuable 
resources--driving growth, creating jobs, and supporting businesses 
across America. During National Oceans Month, we reaffirm our commitment 
to the oceans and celebrate the myriad benefits they bring to all 
Americans.
From tourism and fishing to international commerce and renewable energy 
production, coastal and waterside communities help maintain vital 
sectors of our Nation's economy. Yet, while our livelihoods are 
inseparable from the health of these natural systems, our oceans are 
under threat from pollution, coastal development, overfishing, and 
climate change. That is why I established our first ever comprehensive 
National Ocean Policy. The Policy lays out a science-based approach to 
conservation and management, and brings together Federal, State, local, 
and tribal governments with all those who have a stake in our oceans, 
coasts, and the Great Lakes--including recreational and commercial 
fishermen, boaters, offshore and coastal industries, environmental 
groups, scientists, and the public. Through the Policy, we have already 
expanded access to information and tools to support ocean planning 
efforts. Together, I am confident we will sustain these precious 
ecosystems and the diverse activities they support.
President John F. Kennedy once told us, ``We are tied to the ocean. And 
when we go back to the sea--whether it is to sail or to watch it--we are 
going back from whence we came.'' During National Oceans Month, let us 
celebrate our heritage as a seafaring Nation by instilling an ethic of 
good ocean stewardship in all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2012 as National 
Oceans Month. I call upon Americans to take action to protect, conserve, 
and restore our oceans, coasts, and the Great Lakes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.

Proclamation 8837 of June 11, 2012

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ninety-six years ago, our Nation first came together to celebrate Flag 
Day--an occasion when President Woodrow Wilson asked us to ``stand with 
united hearts for an America which no man can corrupt, no influence draw 
away from its ideals, no force divide against itself.'' This week, we 
mark nearly one century since that historic proclamation, and more than 
two centuries since the Second Continental Congress brought 13 United 
States under a single standard.
For over 200 years, our flag has proudly represented our Nation and our 
ideals at home and abroad. It has billowed above monuments and 
memorials, flown beside the halls of government, stood watch over our 
oldest institutions, and graced our homes and storefronts. Generations 
of service members have raised our country's colors over military bases 
and at sea, and generations of Americans have lowered them to mourn 
those we have lost. Though our flag has changed to reflect the growth of 
our Republic, it will forever remain an emblem of the ideals that 
inspired our great Nation: liberty, democracy, and the enduring freedom 
to make of our lives what we will.
As we reflect on our heritage, let us remember that our destiny is 
stitched together like those 50 stars and 13 stripes. In red, white, and 
blue, we see the spirit of a Nation, the resilience of our Union, and 
the promise of a future forged in common purpose and dedication to the 
principles that have always kept America strong.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and 
for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution 
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President 
annually issue a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and call upon citizens of the United 
States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2012, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 10, 2012, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by displaying the flag. I also call upon the people of the 
United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from 
Flag Day through Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 
Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in 
public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8838 of June 14, 2012

World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every American deserves the chance to live out the full measure of their 
days in health and security. Yet, every year, millions of older 
Americans are denied that most basic opportunity due to abuse, neglect, 
or exploitation. On World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, we call attention 
to this global public health issue, and we rededicate ourselves to 
providing our elders the care and protection they deserve.
Victims of elder abuse are parents and grandparents, neighbors and 
friends. Elder abuse cuts across race, gender, culture, and 
circumstance, and whether physical, emotional, or financial, it takes an 
unacceptable toll on individuals and families across our Nation. Seniors 
who experience abuse or neglect face a heightened risk of health 
complications and premature death, while financial exploitation can rob 
men and women of the security they have built over a lifetime. 
Tragically, many older Americans suffer in silence, burdened by fear, 
shame, or impairments that prevent them from speaking out about abuse.
We owe it to our seniors to expose elder abuse wherever we find it and 
take action to bring it to an end. Two years ago, I was proud to sign 
the Elder Justice Act, which was included in the Affordable Care Act, 
and marked a major step forward in the fight against elder abuse, 
neglect, and exploitation. With the Department of Health and Human 
Services, we are partnering with State and local authorities to ensure 
seniors can live their lives with dignity and independence. With the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, we are working to empower older 
Americans with tools and information to navigate safely through 
financial challenges. And with the Department of Justice, we are 
protecting older Americans by prosecuting those who would target and 
exploit them.
Every day, State and local agencies, protective services professionals, 
law enforcement officers, private and non-profit organizations, and 
leaders throughout our communities help protect older Americans from 
abuse and provide care to those who have already been affected. 
Together, all of us can play a role in addressing this public health 
crisis that puts millions at risk. Today, let us keep faith with a 
generation of Americans by speaking out against elder abuse, advancing 
justice for victims, and building a Nation that preserves and protects 
the well-being of all who call it home.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 15, 2012, as 
World

[[Page 90]]

Elder Abuse Awareness Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day 
by learning the signs of elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, and by 
raising awareness about this public health issue.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8839 of June 15, 2012

Father's Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, ordinary Americans make extraordinary contributions to the 
well-being of our children and the strength of our Nation by answering 
one of life's greatest callings--parenthood. Morning, noon, and night, 
they dedicate themselves to their sons and daughters, expressing a love 
that knows neither beginning nor end through small daily acts. On 
Father's Day, we honor the men whose compassion and commitment have 
nourished our spirits and guided us toward brighter horizons.
For many of us, our fathers show us by the example they set the kind of 
people they want us to become. Whether biological, foster, or adoptive, 
they teach us through the encouragement they give, the questions they 
answer, the limits they set, and the strength they show in the face of 
difficulty and hardship. Our fathers impart lessons and values we will 
always carry with us. With their presence and their care, they not only 
fulfill a profound responsibility, but also share a blessing with their 
children that stands among our truest traditions.
Every father bears a fundamental obligation to do right by their 
children. Yet, today, too many young Americans grow up without the love 
and support of their fathers. When the responsibilities of fathers go 
unmet, our communities suffer. That is why my Administration is working 
to promote responsible fatherhood by helping dads re-engage with their 
families and supporting programs that work with fathers. And that is why 
men across our country are making the decision every single day to step 
up; to be good fathers; and to serve as mentors, tutors, and foster 
parents to young people who need the guiding hand of a caring adult.
All of us have a stake in forging stronger bonds between fathers and 
their children. Today, we celebrate men who have risen to the task, who 
raised us, and who do that most important work of parenting, day in and 
day out, with love, humility, and pride.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 17, 
2012, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the 
Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government 
buildings on this

[[Page 91]]

day, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
sixth.

Proclamation 8840 of June 29, 2012

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974, 
as amended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(B)), the 
President may designate certain articles as eligible for preferential 
tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when 
imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country.
2. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act, and after 
receiving advice from the United States International Trade Commission 
(the ``Commission'') in accordance with section 503(e) of the 1974 Act 
(19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), I have determined to designate certain articles as 
eligible articles when imported from a least-developed beneficiary 
developing country.
3. Section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(C)) 
provides that a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary 
developing country with respect to an eligible article may be 
redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such 
article, subject to the considerations set forth in sections 501 and 502 
of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462), if imports of such article from such 
country did not exceed the competitive need limitations in section 
503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)) during the 
preceding calendar year.
4. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, and having taken 
into account the considerations set forth in sections 501 and 502 of the 
1974 Act, I have determined to redesignate certain countries as 
beneficiary developing countries with respect to certain eligible 
articles that previously had been imported in quantities exceeding the 
competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act.
5. Section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act provides that beneficiary 
developing countries, except those designated as least-developed 
beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
countries as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to competitive need limitations on the 
preferential treatment afforded under the GSP to eligible articles.
6. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that in 2011 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible 
articles

[[Page 92]]

in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need limitations, and 
I therefore terminate the duty-free treatment for such articles from 
such beneficiary developing countries.
7. Section 503(d)(4)(B)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(d)(4)(B)(ii)) provides that the President should revoke any waiver 
of the application of the competitive need limitations that has been in 
effect with respect to an article for 5 years or more if the beneficiary 
developing country has exported to the United States during the 
preceding calendar an amount that exceeds the quantity set forth in 
section 503(d)(4)(B)(ii)(I) or section 503(d)(4)(B)(ii)(II) of the 1974 
Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(4)(B)(ii)(I) and 19 U.S.C. 
2463(d)(4)(B)(ii)(II)).
8. Pursuant to section 503(d)(4)(B)(ii) of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined that in 2011 certain beneficiary developing countries 
exported eligible articles for which a waiver has been in effect for 5 
years or more in quantities exceeding the applicable limitation set 
forth in section 503(d)(4)(B)(ii)(I) or section 503(d)(4)(B)(ii)(II) of 
the 1974 Act, and I therefore revoke said waivers.
9. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) 
provides that the President may disregard the competitive need 
limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from 
any beneficiary developing country, if the aggregate appraised value of 
the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
10. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect 
to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing 
countries.
11. Section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(1)) provides 
that the President may waive the application of the competitive need 
limitations in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act with respect to any 
eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain 
conditions are met.
12. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the 
advice of the Commission on whether any industry in the United States is 
likely to be adversely affected by waivers of the competitive need 
limitations provided in section 503(c)(2), and I have determined, based 
on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 
502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)) and after giving great weight 
to the considerations in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(d)(2)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of 
the United States. Accordingly, I have determined that the competitive 
need limitations of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act should be waived 
with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary 
developing countries.
13. Section 502(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(e)) provides that the 
President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
developing country if the President determines that such country has 
become

[[Page 93]]

a ``high income'' country as defined by the official statistics of the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Termination is 
effective on January 1 of the second year following the year in which 
such determination is made.
14. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that 
Gibraltar has become a ``high income'' country, and I am terminating the 
designation of that country as a beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2014, and I will so notify the 
Congress.
15. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have also determined 
that the Turks and Caicos Islands has become a ``high income'' country, 
and I am terminating the designation of that country as a beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2014, 
and I will so notify the Congress.
16. Pursuant to section 502(a)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2462(a)(2)), the President is authorized to designate any beneficiary 
developing country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country 
for purposes of the GSP. Section 502(f)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2462(f)(1)(B)) requires the President to notify the Congress at least 60 
days before designating any country as a least-developed beneficiary 
developing country.
17. Pursuant to section 502(a)(2) of the 1974 Act, having considered the 
factors set forth in section 501 and section 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have determined that the Republic of Senegal 
(Senegal) should be designated as a least-developed beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP, and I will so notify the 
Congress.
18. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and 
of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, 
including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate 
of duty or other import restriction.
19. The short form name of East Timor has been changed to Timor-Leste, 
and I have determined that general note 4 to the HTS should be modified 
to reflect this change.
20. Presidential Proclamation 7011 of June 30, 1997, implemented the 
World Trade Organization Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information 
Technology Products (the ``ITA'') for the United States. Products 
included in Attachment B to the ITA are entitled to duty-free treatment 
wherever classified. In order to maintain the intended tariff treatment 
for certain products covered in Attachment B, I have determined that 
technical corrections to the HTS are necessary.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles only 
when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the 
corresponding HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in section A of 
Annex I to this proclamation.

[[Page 94]]

(2) In order to redesignate certain articles as eligible articles for 
purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the 
corresponding HTS subheadings and general note 4(d) to the HTS are 
modified as set forth in section B of Annex I to this proclamation.
(3) In order to provide that one or more countries should no longer be 
treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more 
eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special 
subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings and general note 4(d) to 
the HTS is modified as set forth in section C of Annex I to this 
proclamation.
(4) In order to reflect the change in the name of East Timor, general 
notes 4(a) and 4(b)(i) to the HTS are modified as provided in section D 
of Annex I to this proclamation.

Proclamation 8841 of July 16, 2012

Captive Nations Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower first proclaimed Captive Nations 
Week amidst an escalating Cold War, he affirmed that ``the citizens of 
the United States are linked by bonds of family and principle to those 
who love freedom and justice on every continent.'' Our world has changed 
dramatically since 1959, but those unbreakable bonds endure. During 
Captive Nations Week, America renews our abiding ties to all peoples who 
struggle to claim their inalienable rights.
From the Baltic Sea to the Balkan Peninsula, once-captive nations 
inspired the world when bold patriots stepped forward to regain their 
countries' sovereignty and their citizens' dignity. Today, we see the 
same courage in protesters who brave the line of fire to sound the call 
for reform. We see the same fierce hope in those who defy censorship and 
reach beyond an electronic curtain to connect with people around the 
world. As individuals rise to demand their universal rights, the United 
States stands with them in pursuit of equality, justice, and freedom.
As strongly as my Administration condemns tyranny, we embrace emerging 
democracies and welcome the chance to work with those who seek to 
restore their peoples' liberty. With our partners in the international 
community, we will continue striving to advance human rights, grow 
prosperity, and meet mutual challenges with global solutions. And as 
long as there are people who live in the darkness of oppression, America 
will remain their steadfast friend, linked by a common dream and our 
common ideals.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 15 through July 21, 2012, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to reaffirm 
our deep ties to all governments and people committed to freedom, 
dignity, and opportunity for all.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8842 of July 20, 2012

Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Aurora, Colorado

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence 
perpetrated on July 20, 2012, in Aurora, Colorado, by the authority 
vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag 
of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and 
upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval 
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the 
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its 
Territories and possessions until sunset, July 25, 2012. I also direct 
that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time 
at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other 
facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels 
and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8843 of July 26, 2012

Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our earliest days, America has measured its progress not only by 
the growth of our borders and the breadth of our economy, but also by 
how far we reach toward fully realizing the fundamental rights, 
protections, and freedoms afforded to each of us by our Nation's 
founding documents. For generations, many Americans with disabilities 
lived as second-class citizens who were denied those most basic 
opportunities. Not content to accept the world as it was, they marched 
and organized and testified, coupling quiet acts of persistence and 
perseverance with vocal acts of advocacy. And step by step, progress was 
won. Protections were put into law. And a wave of change swept across 
our country, tearing down the barriers that kept persons with 
disabilities from securing their fullest measure of happiness.
Today, we mark the 22nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA)--a historic piece of civil rights legislation that affirmed 
Americans with disabilities are Americans first. When many wrongfully 
doubted that people with disabilities could participate in our society, 
contribute to our economy, or support their families, the ADA asserted 
that they could. Under this landmark law, America became the first 
Nation to comprehensively declare equality for its citizens with 
disabilities--an accomplishment

[[Page 103]]

that continues to guide our country toward fulfilling its most essential 
promises not just for some, but for all.
Yet, despite the gains we have made, independence and freedom from 
discrimination remain out of reach for too many individuals with 
disabilities. That is why my Administration continues to build on the 
legacy set forth by the ADA. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 
insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to children with 
disabilities because of pre-existing conditions, medical history, or 
genetic information--a provision that will be extended to all Americans 
in 2014. We have fought to protect and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid 
by improving benefits and opposing proposals that would shift costs to 
seniors and persons with disabilities. And earlier this year, we 
established the Administration for Community Living at the Department of 
Health and Human Services to help ensure people with disabilities have 
the support they need to live with respect and dignity in their 
communities, and to be fully included in our national life.
Because every American deserves access to a world-class education, we 
have worked to make learning environments safer and more inclusive. Last 
September, the Department of Education implemented new standards for the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act that will help measure and 
improve outcomes for infants and toddlers with disabilities. Moving 
forward, we will continue to take action to help all children learn, 
develop, and participate in instructional programs that equip them with 
the tools for success in school and beyond.
As we mark this milestone and reflect on the barriers that remain, we 
also pay tribute to the courageous individuals and communities who have 
made progress possible. Because so many advocates understood injustice 
from the depths of their own experience, they also knew that by allowing 
injustice to stand, we were depriving our Nation and our economy of the 
full talents and contributions of tens of millions of Americans with 
disabilities. Today, those Americans are leaders not only in every field 
and throughout every part of our national life, but also in the journey 
to bring the American dream within reach for our next generation. On 
this anniversary of the ADA, we celebrate the contributions Americans 
with disabilities have made to our Nation, and we rededicate ourselves 
to empowering every individual with those most American principles of 
equal access and equal opportunity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2012, the 
Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I encourage 
Americans across our Nation to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of this 
civil rights law and the many contributions of individuals with 
disabilities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8844 of July 27, 2012

National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty-two years ago, the Communist invasion of the Republic of Korea 
summoned a generation of Americans to serve. From the landings at Inchon 
to the Pusan Perimeter, from Heartbreak Ridge to Chosin Reservoir, our 
forces fought with immeasurable courage in one of the defining moments 
of the Cold War. Today, on the 59th anniversary of the Military 
Armistice Agreement signed at Panmunjom, we honor all who served in the 
Korean War, and we pay lasting tribute to the brave men and women who 
gave their lives for our Nation.
Through 3 years of combat, American service members and allied forces 
overcame some of the most unforgiving conditions in modern warfare. They 
weathered bitter winters and punishing heat. They fought on with courage 
and distinction--often outgunned and outmanned. Many Americans suffered 
wounds that would never fully heal. Still more we count among the 
captured and the missing, and our resolve to account for Americans who 
did not come home will never waver. Most of all, we honor the tens of 
thousands of Americans who gave their lives defending a country they had 
never known and a people they had never met. Their legacy lives on not 
only in the hearts of the American people, but in a Republic of Korea 
that is free and prosperous; an alliance that is stronger than ever 
before; and a world that is safer for their service.
Shortly after the Military Armistice Agreement was signed, President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower noted that ``with special feelings of sorrow--and 
of solemn gratitude--we think of those who were called upon to lay down 
their lives in that far-off land to prove once again that only courage 
and sacrifice can keep freedom alive upon the earth.'' Nearly six 
decades later, we renew that call to honor and reflect. Now and forever, 
let us keep faith with our Korean War veterans by upholding the ideals 
they fought to protect, and by supporting them with the care and respect 
they so deeply deserve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2012, as 
National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor 
our distinguished Korean War veterans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8845 of July 27, 2012

World Hepatitis Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Worldwide, one in twelve people is living with viral hepatitis--a 
disease that threatens the health of millions of Americans and people 
across the globe. As a leading cause of liver cancer in the United 
States, it remains a major public health challenge here at home. Because 
the disease can persist for decades without symptoms, many Americans who 
are chronically infected are unaware of their infection status. On World 
Hepatitis Day, we call attention to this silent epidemic, and we 
rededicate ourselves to the fight against viral hepatitis.
Hepatitis prevention and control begins with awareness. Though all types 
of viral hepatitis are associated with serious health issues, hepatitis 
B and C can become chronic infections that often lead to liver cirrhosis 
or liver cancer. Tragically, complications resulting from viral 
hepatitis claim thousands of American lives every year--a burden borne 
disproportionately by African American, Hispanic, and Asian American and 
Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities, and by persons born between 1945 
and 1965. Despite the health issues associated with the disease, a 
majority of Americans living with chronic hepatitis do not know they are 
infected.
Hepatitis A and B can be prevented with vaccines, which are recommended 
for all children--and for adults who are at high risk of contracting 
viral hepatitis. While no vaccine exists for hepatitis C, early 
detection and treatment can curb transmission, limit the disease's 
progression, and prevent life-threatening complications, including liver 
cancer. I encourage all Americans to talk with a physician about 
hepatitis prevention to learn more about what they can do to stay 
healthy.
My Administration remains committed to addressing viral hepatitis. As 
part of our Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral 
Hepatitis; the Healthy People 2020 initiative; and other Federal 
programs, agencies across the Federal Government are partnering with 
States, communities, and stakeholders throughout the private and 
nonprofit sectors to prevent new cases of hepatitis and help Americans 
who have already been affected. We are promoting hepatitis outreach and 
education that shines a light on this public health issue. With the 
White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, we are 
working to prevent, treat, and control hepatitis B infections in AAPI 
communities. And by bringing health insurance within reach for more 
Americans, the Affordable Care Act is helping improve patient access to 
comprehensive viral hepatitis prevention and treatment services.
On World Hepatitis Day, let us raise awareness of the global health 
threat of viral hepatitis, renew our support for those living with the 
disease, and recommit to a future free of this tragic illness.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 28, 2012, as 
World

[[Page 106]]

Hepatitis Day. I encourage citizens, Government agencies, nonprofit 
organizations, and communities across the Nation to join in activities 
that will increase awareness about hepatitis and what we can do to 
prevent it.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8847 of August 6, 2012

National Health Center Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For nearly half a century, health centers have helped make primary care 
services available and affordable for millions of Americans. From coast 
to coast, they deliver critical support for patients by not only 
providing treatment for those in need, but also emphasizing preventive 
care that helps

[[Page 107]]

people lead healthier lives. During National Health Center Week, we 
recognize the professionals who power our Nation's health centers and 
renew our support for these essential health care resources.
Health centers play a key role in bringing vital health care services to 
20 million Americans from all walks of life. They lift up rural and 
urban neighborhoods alike, extending community-based, patient-directed 
care to those who need it most. Through their work, health centers 
strengthen our health care system by helping reduce emergency room 
visits and easing health care burdens for families across America.
My Administration is working to empower health centers with the 
resources they need to provide comprehensive, high-quality care for more 
individuals. Thanks primarily to the Affordable Care Act and the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, health centers are serving 
nearly 3 million additional patients. Last year, my Administration 
launched an initiative to support 500 health centers in 44 States as 
they seek to expand their ability to better coordinate patient care. 
This May, my Administration expanded on that progress by announcing 
Affordable Care Act funding that will support hundreds of renovation and 
construction projects at health centers nationwide.
As we continue to build a health care system ready to meet patients' 
needs today and tomorrow, health centers will remain an integral part of 
our communities and our country. This week, we celebrate their many 
contributions to our public health, and to providing more Americans with 
accessible, affordable health care.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of August 5 
through August 11, 2012, as National Health Center Week. I encourage all 
Americans to celebrate this week by visiting their local health center, 
meeting health center providers, and exploring the programs they offer 
to help keep families healthy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8848 of August 24, 2012

Women's Equality Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Women's Equality Day, we mark the anniversary of our Constitution's 
19th Amendment, which secured the right to vote for America's women. The 
product of profound struggle and fierce hope, the 19th Amendment 
reaffirmed what we have always known: that America is a place where 
anything is possible and where each of us is entitled to the full 
pursuit of our own happiness. We also know that the defiant, can-do 
spirit that moved

[[Page 108]]

millions to seek suffrage is what runs through the veins of American 
history. It remains the wellspring of all our progress. And nearly a 
century after the battle for women's franchise was won, a new generation 
of young women stands ready to carry that spirit forward and bring us 
closer to a world where there are no limits on how big our children can 
dream or how high they can reach.
To keep our Nation moving ahead, all Americans--men and women--must be 
able to help provide for their families and contribute fully to our 
economy. That is why I have made supporting the needs and aspirations of 
women and girls a top priority for my Administration. From signing the 
Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law and creating the White House 
Council on Women and Girls to combatting sexual assault and promoting 
women's economic and political empowerment at home and abroad, we have 
worked to ensure women have the opportunities they need and deserve at 
every stage of their lives. As women around the world continue to fight 
for their seat at the table, my Administration will keep their interests 
at the core of our policy decisions--and we will join them every step of 
the way.
Today, women are nearly 50 percent of our workforce, the majority of 
students in our colleges and graduate schools, and a growing number of 
breadwinners in their families. From business to medicine to our 
military, women are leading the fields that were closed off to them only 
decades ago. We owe that legacy of progress to our mothers and aunts, 
grandmothers and great-grandmothers--women who proved not only that 
opportunity and equality do not come without a fight, but also that they 
are possible. Even with the gains we have made, we still have work to 
do. As we mark this 92nd anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let us 
reflect on how far we have come toward fully realizing the basic 
freedoms enshrined in our founding documents, rededicate ourselves to 
closing the gaps that remain, and continue to widen the doors of 
opportunity for all of our daughters and sons.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2012, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
celebrate the achievements of women and recommit to realizing gender 
equality in this country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8850 of August 31, 2012

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, millions of Americans with substance use disorders commit to 
managing their health by maintaining their recovery from drug or alcohol 
addiction. People in recovery are not strangers: they are our family 
members, friends, colleagues, and neighbors. During National Alcohol and 
Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we recognize their strength and 
resilience. In partnership with Americans in recovery, let us rededicate 
ourselves to combatting prejudice surrounding addiction, removing 
barriers to recovery, and standing with all those seeking lives free 
from substance use.
My Administration is committed to advancing evidence-based recovery 
solutions. Over the past 3 years, we have worked to strengthen substance 
abuse prevention and treatment programs, and to support Americans in 
recovery. We have taken steps to identify and remove laws, policies, and 
practices that impede recovery. And as part of our 2012 National Drug 
Control Strategy, we are promoting early intervention and taking action 
to break the cycle of drug abuse and incarceration.
Drug and alcohol abuse continue to take a tragic toll on millions of 
lives across our country. Yet, while more remains to be done, men and 
women across our country are making great strides. This month, let us 
encourage

[[Page 110]]

their progress, celebrate the transformative power of recovery, and 
thank the many Americans who, often strengthened by their own 
experiences, are working to improve the health and safety of our 
communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2012 as 
National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the 
people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8851 of August 31, 2012

National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every year, thousands of children across America are diagnosed with 
cancer--an often life-threatening illness that remains the leading cause 
of death by disease for children under the age of 15. The causes of 
pediatric cancer are still largely unknown, and though new discoveries 
are resulting in new treatments, this heartbreaking disease continues to 
scar families and communities in ways that may never fully heal. This 
month, we remember the young lives taken too soon, stand with the 
families facing childhood cancer today, and rededicate ourselves to 
combating this terrible illness.
While much remains to be done, our Nation has come far in the fight to 
understand, treat, and control childhood cancer. Thanks to ongoing 
advances in research and treatment, the 5-year survival rate for all 
childhood cancers has climbed from less than 50 percent to 80 percent 
over the past several decades. Researchers around the world continue to 
pioneer new therapies and explore the root causes of the disease, 
driving progress that could reveal cures or improved outcomes for 
patients. But despite the gains we have made, help still does not come 
soon enough for many of our sons and daughters, and too many families 
suffer pain and devastating loss.
My Administration will continue to support families battling pediatric 
cancer and work to ease the burdens they face. Under the Affordable Care 
Act, insurance companies can no longer deny health coverage to children 
because of pre-existing conditions, including cancer, nor can they drop 
coverage because a child is diagnosed with cancer. The law also bans 
insurers from placing a lifetime dollar limit on the amount of coverage 
they provide, giving families peace of mind that their coverage will be 
there when they need it most. And as we work to ensure all Americans 
have access to affordable health care, my Administration will continue 
to invest in the cutting-edge cancer research that paves the way for 
tomorrow's breakthroughs.

[[Page 111]]

This month, we pay tribute to the families, friends, professionals, and 
communities who lend their strength to children fighting pediatric 
cancer. May their courage and commitment continue to move us toward new 
cures, healthier outcomes, and a brighter future for America's youth.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2012 as 
National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all Americans to 
join me in reaffirming our commitment to fighting childhood cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8852 of August 31, 2012

National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Over the past several decades, childhood obesity has become a serious 
public health issue that puts millions of our sons and daughters at 
risk. The stakes are high: if we do not solve this problem, many among 
America's next generation will face diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and 
other health problems associated with obesity. Thankfully, while more 
remains to be done, we are making real progress toward a healthier 
future for our children. During National Childhood Obesity Awareness 
Month, we rededicate ourselves to meeting that critical responsibility.
For more than 2 years, First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! 
initiative has worked with stakeholders across the private and public 
sectors to expand access to nutritious food, promote physical activity, 
encourage healthy food choices, create healthy starts for children, and 
ensure families have the tools they need to make healthy decisions. 
Communities from coast to coast are taking action to fulfill those 
goals. Over 4,000 schools have established rigorous nutrition and 
physical activity standards through the HealthierUS School Challenge, 
and more than a million Americans have earned the Presidential Active 
Lifestyle Award by committing to healthy eating and regular exercise. 
The Healthy Food Financing Initiative is developing projects that 
increase access to healthy, affordable food in communities that 
currently lack these options. Let's Move! has also partnered with faith-
based and community organizations that are expanding access to fresh 
fruits and vegetables in their neighborhoods, and local elected 
officials are leading the way in making healthy changes for cities, 
towns, and counties across America.
Earlier this year, my Administration implemented part of the historic 
Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act by releasing new rules for school lunches 
and breakfasts that ensure a higher nutritional standard--one that 
includes

[[Page 112]]

more whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, and less fat and sodium. 
These changes represent the first major revision to school meal 
requirements in more than 15 years, and they come on the heels of recent 
updates to the Federal Government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans. To 
commemorate the healthy choices families, schools, and communities are 
making in kitchens across America, the First Lady was proud to host the 
first Kids' ``State Dinner'' this summer, which welcomed 54 young chefs 
to the White House for a formal luncheon to celebrate their commitment 
to healthy, affordable recipes. To find additional information on how we 
can solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation, visit 
www.LetsMove.gov.
Each of us can play a role in ensuring our children have the opportunity 
to live long, healthy lives, and by joining together in pursuit of that 
mission, I am confident we can build a brighter future for America's 
youth.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2012 as 
National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month. I encourage all Americans to 
learn about and engage in activities that promote healthy eating and 
greater physical activity by all our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8853 of August 31, 2012

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year, thousands of American women will lose their lives to ovarian 
cancer. They are mothers and daughters, sisters and grandmothers, 
community members and cherished friends--and the absence they leave in 
our hearts will be deeply felt forever. During National Ovarian Cancer 
Awareness Month, we honor those we have lost, show our support for women 
who bravely carry on the fight, and take action to lessen the tragic 
toll ovarian cancer takes on families across our Nation.
Sadly, women are all too often diagnosed with this disease when it has 
already reached an advanced stage. Because early detection is the best 
defense against ovarian cancer, it is essential that women know the risk 
factors associated with the disease. Women who are middle-aged or older, 
who have a family history of ovarian or breast cancer, or who have had 
certain cancers in the past are at increased risk of developing ovarian 
cancer. Any woman who thinks she is at risk of ovarian cancer--or who 
experiences symptoms, including abdominal pain, pressure, or swelling--

[[Page 113]]

should talk with her health care provider. To learn more, visit 
www.Cancer.gov.
Ongoing progress in science and medicine is moving us forward in the 
battle against ovarian cancer, and my Administration remains committed 
to improving outcomes for women suffering from this devastating illness. 
Through agencies across the Federal Government, we are continuing to 
invest in research that paves the way for a new generation of tests and 
treatments. Through the Centers for Disease Control's Inside Knowledge 
campaign, we are working to raise awareness about the signs and symptoms 
of ovarian cancer. The Affordable Care Act already bans insurance 
companies from dropping a woman's coverage because she has ovarian 
cancer, and from placing lifetime or restrictive annual dollar limits on 
her coverage. Beginning in 2014, the law will also prohibit insurers 
from denying coverage or charging higher premiums because a woman has 
ovarian cancer--or any other pre-existing condition.
Ovarian cancer affects the lives of far too many women every year, and 
the tragedy it leaves in its wake reverberates in communities across our 
country. This month, we stand with all those who have known the pain of 
ovarian cancer, and we rededicate ourselves to the pursuit of new and 
better ways to prevent, detect, and treat this devastating disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2012 as 
National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon citizens, 
government agencies, organizations, health care providers, and research 
institutions to raise ovarian cancer awareness and continue helping 
Americans live longer, healthier lives. I also urge women across our 
country to talk to their health care providers and learn more about this 
disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8854 of August 31, 2012

National Preparedness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As thousands of our fellow Americans respond to and recover from the 
damage done by Hurricane Isaac, we are called to remember that 
throughout our history, emergencies and natural disasters have tested 
the fabric of our country. During National Preparedness Month, we renew 
our commitment to promoting emergency preparedness in homes, businesses, 
and communities nationwide, and to building an America more ready and 
resilient than ever before.

[[Page 114]]

Each of us has an important role to play in bolstering our preparedness 
for disasters of all types--from cyber incidents and acts of terrorism 
to tornadoes and flooding. That is why my Administration is pursuing an 
approach to emergency management that engages the whole community--from 
Federal, State, local, and tribal governments to the private sector, 
nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and the general public. I 
encourage all Americans to visit www.Ready.gov or www.Listo.gov to learn 
more about the risks facing their communities, find out what they can do 
to prepare, and join thousands of individuals from coast to coast by 
becoming a member of the National Preparedness Coalition. Individuals 
and families can also take action by building a disaster supply kit with 
food, water, and essential supplies in case of emergency, and by 
developing and sharing an emergency plan with their loved ones.
As cities and towns across our country recover from natural disasters 
that have spanned historic drought to devastating wildfires and storms, 
we are reminded of the spirit of resilience that binds us together as 
one people and as one American family. This month, let us honor that 
spirit by standing with all those affected by recent severe weather, as 
well as past disasters, and by taking the steps we can to protect our 
loved ones and our communities before disaster strikes.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2012 as 
National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans to recognize the 
importance of preparedness and observe this month by working together to 
enhance our national security, resilience, and readiness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8855 of August 31, 2012

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Prostate cancer is among the most common cancers for men living in the 
United States, and despite the progress we have made in controlling it, 
the disease continues to take a devastating toll on thousands of lives 
every year. During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we remember 
those we have lost to prostate cancer, and we renew our commitment to 
preventing, detecting, and treating this terrible illness.
While the causes of prostate cancer are still unknown, men with certain 
risk factors may be more likely to develop the disease. Most men who 
suffer from prostate cancer are over the age of 65; those whose fathers, 
brothers, or sons have had prostate cancer are also at greater risk. 
Prostate cancer

[[Page 115]]

is especially prevalent among African American men, who experience both 
the highest incidence and the highest mortality rates of prostate 
cancer. I encourage all men to visit www.Cancer.gov to learn the warning 
signs of this disease.
My Administration will continue to stand with men and their families in 
the fight against prostate cancer. To ensure patients are covered when 
they need it most, the Affordable Care Act prevents insurers from 
placing lifetime or restrictive annual dollar limits on essential health 
benefits--and from dropping coverage when people get sick. Beginning in 
2014, the Act will also help Americans get the services they need by 
prohibiting insurance companies from discriminating against people with 
pre-existing conditions. And to advance the state of care for men with 
prostate cancer, my Administration will continue to support promising 
research that brings us closer to tomorrow's groundbreaking therapies, 
treatments, and prevention techniques.
Too many men will develop prostate cancer during their lifetimes. As we 
mark National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, let us support the 
families who fight alongside them, pay tribute to the professionals who 
pursue the highest standards of care, and rededicate ourselves to 
improving outcomes for prostate cancer patients across our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2012 as 
National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, 
government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and 
other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and 
prevention of prostate cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8856 of August 31, 2012

National Wilderness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For centuries, America's dramatic landscapes have attracted people from 
around the world to begin new lives and develop thriving communities on 
our lands. Today, our wilderness areas reflect an essential part of our 
national character, and as a people, we are immeasurably richer for 
their presence. Protected wilderness areas are recreational escapes for 
families, natural classrooms for students, living laboratories for 
scientists, irreplaceable retreats for sportsmen and women, and 
historical treasures for the American people. These landscapes provide 
clean air, clean water, and essential

[[Page 116]]

habitats for fish and wildlife, and they serve as critical storehouses 
of biodiversity. From mountains and meadows to river valleys and 
forests, our lands and waters also help drive local economies by 
creating jobs in tourism and recreation. Our open spaces are more 
precious today than ever before, and it is essential that we come 
together to protect them for the next generation.
American conservation practices inspired countries around the world 
during the 20th century, and my Administration is working to carry that 
legacy forward during the 21st. In my first months as President, I was 
proud to sign a public lands bill that designated more than 2 million 
acres of wilderness, over 1,000 miles of wild and scenic rivers, and 
three National Parks. We also launched the America's Great Outdoors 
Initiative, which laid the foundation for a comprehensive, community-
driven conservation strategy that continues to engage Americans in 
protecting and increasing access to our natural heritage. Today, 
projects spanning from the Atlantic to the Pacific are helping create 
and enhance parks, renew and restore our rivers, and conserve our iconic 
open spaces.
Generations of visionary leaders and communities have given of 
themselves to preserve our wild landscapes, fulfilling a responsibility 
that falls to us all as Americans and as inhabitants of this small 
planet. During National Wilderness Month, let us celebrate the progress 
we have made toward meeting that essential challenge, and let us 
recommit to protecting the land we love for centuries to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2012 as 
National Wilderness Month. I invite all Americans to visit and enjoy our 
wilderness areas, to learn about their vast history, and to aid in the 
protection of our precious national treasures.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8857 of August 31, 2012

Labor Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Through times of prosperity and hardship alike, America counts on the 
strength and dynamism of the world's finest labor force. From the 
factory floor and the office to the classroom and the interstate, 
working men and women are the unshakable foundation of American 
innovation and economic growth. On Labor Day, we celebrate their vital 
role and reaffirm that America will always stand behind our workers.

[[Page 117]]

The rights and benefits we enjoy today were not simply handed to working 
men and women; they had to be won. Brick by brick, America's labor 
unions helped raise the landmarks of middle-class security: the 40-hour 
workweek and weekends, paid leave and pensions, the minimum wage and 
health insurance, Social Security and Medicare. These are the victories 
that make our Nation's promise possible--the idea that if we work hard 
and play by the rules, we can make a better life for ourselves and our 
families.
I am committed to preserving the collective bargaining rights that 
helped build the greatest middle class the world has ever known. It is 
the fundamental right of every American to have a voice on the job, and 
a chance to negotiate for fair pay, safe working conditions, and a 
secure retirement. When we uphold these basic principles, our middle 
class grows and everybody prospers.
Our Nation faces tough times, but I have never stopped betting on the 
American worker. This is the labor force that revolutionized the 
assembly line and built the arsenal of democracy that defeated fascism 
in World War II. These are the workers who built our homes, highways, 
and rail lines, who educate our children and care for the sick. American 
workers have taken us through the digital revolution and into a 21st-
century economy. As my Administration fights to create good jobs and 
restore the American dream, I am confident that, together, we will 
emerge from today's challenges as we always have--stronger than ever 
before.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 3, 2012, as 
Labor Day. I call upon all public officials and people of the United 
States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities that honor the contributions and resilience of working 
Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8858 of September 7, 2012

National Grandparents Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, grandparents have guided their children and 
grandchildren through trial and triumph. For many of us, our 
grandparents were among our earliest teachers and caregivers. They have 
added immeasurably to the strength of our families, and with compassion 
and wisdom, they have enriched our lives with the stories of those who 
came before us. On National Grandparents Day, we give thanks to those 
who helped raise us and pay tribute to a generation that still inspires 
us toward brighter horizons.

[[Page 118]]

Our grandparents set the course of an American century. They have 
witnessed great milestones in our Nation's history, and from the 
battlefield to the factory floor to their neighborhoods, our 
grandparents' tireless pursuit of progress has paved the road that we 
travel today. Just as they helped shape the country we know and love, so 
have they shaped each of us into who we are as individuals. Our 
grandmothers and grandfathers have profoundly influenced every part of 
our society, and as their grandchildren, it is incumbent upon all of us 
to provide them with the care and support they so deeply deserve.
Today, we honor America's grandparents, and we celebrate their indelible 
contributions to family, community, and country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 9, 2012, as 
National Grandparents Day. I call upon all Americans to take the time to 
honor their own grandparents and those in their community.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8859 of September 7, 2012

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Eleven years ago, America confronted one of our darkest days. The events 
of September 11, 2001, brought collapsing towers in Manhattan and 
billowing smoke at the Pentagon, wreckage on a Pennsylvania field, and 
deep ache to the soul of our Nation. Nearly 3,000 innocent people lost 
their lives that morning; still more gave theirs in service during the 
hours, days, and years that followed. All were loved, and none will be 
forgotten. On these days of prayer and remembrance, we mourn again the 
men, women, and children who were taken from us with terrible swiftness, 
stand with their friends and family, honor the courageous patriots who 
responded in our country's moment of need, and, with God's grace, 
rededicate ourselves to a spirit of unity and renewal.
Those who attacked us sought to deprive our Nation of the very ideals 
for which we stand--but in the aftermath of this tragedy, the American 
people kept alive the virtues and values that make us who we are and who 
we must always be. Today, the legacy of September 11 is one of rescue 
workers who rushed to the scene, firefighters who charged up the stairs, 
passengers who stormed the cockpit--courageous individuals who put their 
lives on the line to save people they never knew. It is also a legacy of 
those who stood up to serve in our Armed Forces. In the 11 years since 
that day, more than 2 million American service members have gone to war. 
They

[[Page 119]]

have volunteered, leaving the comforts of home and family to defend the 
country they love and the people they hold dear. Many have returned with 
dark memories of distant places and fallen friends; too many will never 
return at all. As we mark these solemn days, we pay tribute to the men 
and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in faraway lands, to heroes 
who died in the line of duty here at home, and to all who keep faith 
with the principles of service and sacrifice that will always be the 
source of America's strength.
On September 11, 2001, in our hour of grief, a Nation came together. No 
matter where we came from, what God we prayed to, or what race or 
ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family. This weekend, 
as we honor the memory of those we have lost, let us summon that spirit 
once more. Let us renew our sense of common purpose. And let us reaffirm 
the bond we share as a people: that out of many, we are one.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 7 
through Sunday, September 9, 2012, as National Days of Prayer and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States honor and 
remember the victims of September 11, 2001, and their loved ones through 
prayer, contemplation, memorial services, the visiting of memorials, the 
ringing of bells, evening candlelight remembrance vigils, and other 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I invite people around the world 
to participate in this commemoration.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8860 of September 10, 2012

Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On September 11, 2001, a bright autumn day was darkened by the worst 
attack on the American people in our history. Thousands of innocent men, 
women, and children perished when mighty towers collapsed in the heart 
of New York City and wreckage burned in Pennsylvania and at the 
Pentagon. They were family and friends, service members and first 
responders--and the tragedy of their loss left pain that will never fade 
and scars our country will never forget.
More than a decade later, the world we live in is forever changed. But 
as we mark the anniversary of September 11, we remember what remains the 
same: our character as a Nation, our faith in one another, and our 
legacy as a country strengthened by service and selflessness. In the 
spirit that

[[Page 120]]

moved rescue workers and firefighters to charge into darkness and danger 
that September morning, we see the same sense of moral responsibility 
that drove countless Americans to give of themselves in the months that 
followed. We offered our neighbors a hand and lined up to give blood. 
Many helped our Nation rebuild and recover long after the dust had 
settled, donating and volunteering and helping survivors who had borne 
so much. We were united, and the outpouring of generosity reminded us 
that, through challenges that have spanned from acts of terrorism to 
natural disasters, we go forward together as one people.
Today, as we remember the victims, their families, and the heroes who 
stood up during one of our country's darkest moments, I invite all 
Americans to reclaim that abiding spirit of compassion by serving their 
communities in the days and weeks ahead. From volunteering with a faith-
based organization, to collecting food and clothing for those in need, 
to preparing care packages for our men and women in uniform, there are 
many ways to bring service into our everyday lives--and each of us can 
do something. To get involved and find a local service opportunity, 
visit www.Serve.gov, or www.Servir.gov for Spanish speakers.
Even the simplest act of kindness can be a way to honor those we have 
lost, and to help build stronger communities and a more resilient 
Nation. By joining together on this solemn anniversary, let us show that 
America's sense of common purpose need not be a fleeting moment, but a 
lasting virtue--not just on one day, but every day.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as ``Patriot 
Day,'' and by Public Law 111-13, approved April 21, 2009, the Congress 
has requested the observance of September 11 as an annually recognized 
``National Day of Service and Remembrance.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2012, as Patriot Day and 
National Day of Service and Remembrance. I call upon all departments, 
agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag 
of the United States at half-staff on Patriot Day and National Day of 
Service and Remembrance in honor of the individuals who lost their lives 
on September 11, 2001. I invite the Governors of the United States and 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and interested organizations and 
individuals to join in this observance. I call upon the people of the 
United States to participate in community service in honor of those our 
Nation lost, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities, including remembrance services, and to observe a moment of 
silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the 
innocent victims who perished as a result of the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Honoring the Victims of the Attack in Benghazi, Libya

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a mark of respect for the memory of John Christopher Stevens, United 
States Ambassador to Libya, and American personnel killed in the 
senseless attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi, by the 
authority vested in me as President of the United States by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby

military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the 
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United 
States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, September 16, 
2012. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the 
same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular 
offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities 
and naval vessels and stations.

Proclamation 8862 of September 13, 2012

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, we celebrate our heritage as a country bound together by fidelity 
to a set of ideas and a system of governance first laid out in America's 
Constitution. The product of fierce debate and enduring compromise, our 
Nation's Constitution has guided our progress from 13 to 50 United 
States that stretch from sea to shining sea. It has watched over our 
growth from a fragile experiment in democracy to a beacon of freedom 
that lights the world. It has vested in each of us the power to appeal 
to principles that could broaden democracy's reach.
As we mark this 225th anniversary of the signing of our Constitution, we 
also recognize the candidates for citizenship who will commemorate this 
day by joining our American family. For more than two centuries, our 
country has drawn enterprising men and women from around the world--
individuals who have sought to build a life as good as their talents and 
their hard work would allow. Generations have crossed land and ocean 
because of the belief that, in America, all things are possible. As a 
new group

[[Page 122]]

of citizens takes an oath to support and defend our country's oldest 
principles, we affirm another truth: that our American journey and our 
success would never have been possible without the hope, the drive, and 
the irrepressible optimism that every generation of immigrants has 
brought to our shores. Across our country, Americans are working side-
by-side with our Nation's newest citizens to build strong, welcoming 
communities that embrace the talents and contributions of all their 
members.
This week, we reflect on the basic rights and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the founding documents from which they were drawn, and the 
extraordinary legacy of progress they have enabled. Let us forever 
uphold the ideals the Framers enshrined in our Constitution, and let us 
never cease in our pursuit of the more perfect Union they imagined so 
many years ago.
In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 
U.S.C. 106), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 
108), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning September 
17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2012, as Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2012, as 
Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as 
well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to 
conduct ceremonies and programs that bring together community members to 
reflect on the importance of active citizenship, recognize the enduring 
strength of our Constitution, and reaffirm our commitment to the rights 
and obligations of citizenship in this great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8863 of September 14, 2012

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's story would not be possible without generations of 
Hispanics who have shaped and strengthened the fabric of our Union. They 
have enriched every aspect of our national identity with traditions that 
stretch across centuries and reflect the many ancestries that comprise 
the Hispanic community. This month, we celebrate this rich heritage and 
reflect on the invaluable contributions Hispanics have made to America.
Hispanics have helped shape our communities and expand our country, from 
laboratories and industry to board rooms and classrooms. They have

[[Page 123]]

led movements that pushed our country closer to realizing the democratic 
ideals of America's founding documents, and they have served 
courageously as members of our Armed Forces to defend those ideals at 
home and abroad. Hispanics also serve as leaders throughout the public 
sector, working at the highest levels of our government and serving on 
our highest courts.
As we celebrate these hard-fought achievements, we must also remember 
there is more work to be done to widen the circle of opportunity for the 
Hispanic community and keep the American dream within reach for all who 
seek it. From promoting job creation and ensuring Hispanics are 
represented in the Federal workforce to reshaping our education system 
to meet the demands of the 21st century, my Administration has built 
ladders of opportunity. The Department of Homeland Security has lifted 
the shadow of deportation from talented and patriotic young people who 
were brought to America as children, giving them a degree of relief so 
they can continue contributing to our society, and we remain steadfast 
in our pursuit of meaningful legislative immigration reform.
Whether we trace our roots to those who came here on the Mayflower, who 
settled the Southwest centuries ago, or who joined the American family 
more recently, we share a common belief in the enduring promise of 
America--the promise that regardless of where we come from or what we 
look like, each of us can make it if we try. During National Hispanic 
Heritage Month, as we celebrate the successes of the Hispanic community, 
let us reaffirm our commitment to extending that promise to all 
Americans.
To honor the achievements of Hispanics in America, the Congress by 
Public Law 100-402, as amended, has authorized and requested the 
President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 
through October 15 as ``National Hispanic Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2012, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8864 of September 14, 2012

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During the 236 years since our fundamental rights to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness were first put to paper, ordinary citizens have 
always stood ready to defend them as members of the United States Armed 
Forces. Today's service members represent the latest in the long line of 
heroes who have answered their country's call, and their exceptional 
service in a post-9/11 world has secured their place alongside the 
greatest generations. As essential components of our military, the 
National Guard and Reserve have helped carry that legacy forward. This 
week, we honor their service and sacrifice, give thanks to their 
employers, and reaffirm our commitment to giving our troops, our 
military families, and our veterans the opportunities and support they 
have earned.
Of the more than 2 million Americans who have gone to war since 
September 11, 2001, many have been members of the Guard and Reserve. 
Deployment after deployment, these men and women demonstrate the utmost 
courage and distinction in the line of duty, putting themselves in 
harm's way while knowing all too well the full cost of conflict. Members 
of the Guard and Reserve also serve here at home, stepping in to keep 
our communities safe when emergencies or natural disasters threaten our 
security. For their extraordinary sacrifice, our Nation must serve them 
as well as they have served us--from ensuring they have our fullest 
support on the battlefield to helping them find good jobs when they come 
home.
Businesses across America are helping us meet that obligation by hiring 
and retaining members of the Guard and Reserve, and by creating a 
culture of military support in the workplace. These employers help keep 
our service members' civilian careers moving forward, and many 
demonstrate their invaluable support by ensuring our men and women in 
uniform--and their families--get the flexibility and care they need 
during deployment. At a time when our Nation has asked so much of our 
troops and military families, businesses nationwide are helping them 
meet the challenges they face and defend the country they love.
America shares a sacred trust with all those who serve in our Armed 
Forces, and my Administration remains committed to honoring that trust. 
As part of First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces 
initiative, we have striven to expand employment opportunities for 
veterans and military spouses, and to help workplaces create 
environments that support military families. Within the past year, 2,000 
companies have hired or trained more than 125,000 service members and 
military spouses through Joining Forces. With tools like our online 
Veterans Job Bank, we are connecting veterans to businesses that will 
put their skills to work. I was proud to sign the VOW to Hire Heroes 
Act, which created new tax

[[Page 125]]

credits to encourage employers to hire veterans. And this July, we 
announced an overhaul of our transition assistance program that will 
give departing service members the training they need to find their next 
job or advance their education and skills.
During National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, let us 
pay tribute to the brave men and women who keep our Nation safe and 
celebrate their devoted employers, whose support is vital to the 
strength of our military.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16 through 
September 22, 2012, as National Employer Support of the Guard and 
Reserve Week. I call upon all Americans to join me in expressing our 
heartfelt thanks to the members of the National Guard and Reserve and 
their civilian employers. I also call on State and local officials, 
private organizations, and all military commanders, to observe this week 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8865 of September 14, 2012

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From producing America's food, fuel, and fiber to advancing clean, 
homegrown energy solutions, farmers and ranchers play an essential role 
in driving our country's progress. They keep our economy moving forward, 
and as important stewards of our environment, they help conserve our 
lands, protect our wildlife, and safeguard our waters for future 
generations. During National Farm Safety and Health Week, we celebrate 
agricultural workers' vital contributions and reaffirm our commitment to 
keeping them safe on the job.
Farmers and ranchers put in long hours to accomplish difficult tasks--
rain or shine. Many operate heavy machinery, handle livestock, and work 
under hazardous conditions. Because the demands of the job put 
agricultural workers at high risk of illness and injury, appropriate 
training and education are critical. I encourage all farming and 
ranching families to participate in farm safety and health programs, 
remain aware of the hazards of their working environment, and carry out 
safe practices every step of the way--from equipment inspection to 
handling hazardous materials.
Our Nation's rural communities give America its heartbeat. They are home 
to producers who rise before the dawn, entrepreneurs who bring ideas to 
market, and working men and women who build the American dream with

[[Page 126]]

their bare hands. This week, we honor their tireless efforts and 
rededicate ourselves to equipping our next generation with the knowledge 
and training they need to stay safe and healthy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16 through 
September 22, 2012, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the agencies, organizations, businesses, and extension services that 
serve America's agricultural workers to strengthen their commitment to 
promoting farm safety and health programs. I also urge Americans to 
honor our agricultural heritage and express appreciation to our farmers, 
ranchers, and farm-workers for their contributions to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8866 of September 14, 2012

National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Equipping our children with the knowledge and skills for a lifetime of 
success is among our Nation's most important responsibilities. We know 
that providing the next generation with a world-class education is not 
just a moral obligation--it is a prerequisite for America's progress in 
the 21st century. With Hispanics representing more than 20 percent of 
students enrolled in our public elementary and secondary schools, the 
opportunities in postsecondary education offered to these young people 
will have a significant impact on our country's future. Hispanic-Serving 
Institutions (HSIs) have helped bring the dream of a college education 
within reach for many Hispanic students and their families, and this 
week, we celebrate the critical role these colleges and universities 
play in American higher education.
Across our country, HSIs are giving students access to a quality 
education and vesting in them a lifelong appreciation for intellectual 
inquiry. In these halls of higher learning, students are pursuing 
careers in science and engineering, health care, technology, education, 
and other fields that will bolster our economic prosperity and foster 
American innovation for decades to come. Graduates of these institutions 
are already leaders in every part of our national life, and with these 
institutions graduating such a significant portion of Hispanic students, 
HSIs are helping move us closer to leading the world in college 
completion by 2020.

[[Page 127]]

As we reflect on the contributions of HSIs, let us renew our commitment 
to preparing our future leaders--from focusing on early childhood 
education to combating high school dropout rates--and to supporting 
those institutions that equip students of all backgrounds to take on 
tomorrow's challenges. By honoring this commitment, we uphold that most 
American idea: that with a quality education, a child of any race, 
faith, or station in life can overcome any barriers to achieve his or 
her dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 16 through 
September 22, 2012, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week. I 
call on public officials, educators, and all the people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities that acknowledge the tremendous contributions these 
institutions and their graduates have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8867 of September 20, 2012

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than two centuries, Americans have bravely served our Nation as 
members of our Armed Forces. Many have made profound sacrifices to 
uphold the ideals we cherish, carrying wounds that may never fully heal 
and dark memories that will never fade. Today, we pay solemn tribute to 
service members who bore war's tragic costs as prisoners of war and 
those missing in action. We stand with the families who have known the 
lingering ache of a loved one's uncertain fate. And as a Nation, we 
reaffirm a most sacred obligation: that we must never forget the men and 
women who did not come home, and that we must never stop trying to 
return them to their families and the country they fought to protect.
As long as members of our Armed Forces remain unaccounted for, America 
will bring our fullest resources to bear in finding them and bringing 
them home. It is a promise we make not only to the families of our 
captured and our missing, but to all who have worn the uniform. Our 
Nation continues to recover the remains of fallen heroes we lost in the 
Vietnam War, the Korean War, World War II, and other conflicts. And as 
these patriots are finally laid to rest, we pray their return brings 
closure and a measure of peace to those who knew and loved them. During 
this day of recognition, let us honor their sacrifice once more by 
expressing our deepest gratitude to our service members, our veterans, 
our military families, and all those who have given so much to keep our 
country safe.

[[Page 128]]

On September 21, 2012, the stark black and white banner symbolizing 
America's Missing in Action and Prisoners of War will be flown over the 
White House; the United States Capitol; the Departments of State, 
Defense, and Veterans Affairs; the Selective Service System 
Headquarters; the World War II Memorial; the Korean War Veterans 
Memorial; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; United States post offices; 
national cemeteries; and other locations across our country. We raise 
this flag as a solemn reminder of our obligation to always remember the 
sacrifices made to defend our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 21, 2012, as 
National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I urge all Americans to observe this 
day of honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8868 of September 21, 2012

Establishment of the Chimney Rock National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Chimney Rock site in southwestern Colorado incorporates spiritual, 
historic, and scientific resources of great value and significance. A 
thousand years ago, the vast Chaco civilization was drawn to the site's 
soaring massive rock pinnacles, Chimney Rock and Companion Rock, that 
rise hundreds of feet from the valley floor to an elevation of 7,600 
feet. High atop ancient sandstone formations, Ancestral Pueblo People 
built exquisite stone buildings, including the highest ceremonial 
``great house'' in the Southwest.
This landscape, encompassing both Chimney Rock and Companion Rock, and 
known today as Chimney Rock, holds deep spiritual significance for 
modern Pueblo and tribal communities and was one of the largest 
communities of the Pueblo II era (900-1150 A.D.). The Chimney Rock site 
also includes nationally significant archaeology, archaeoastronomy, 
visual and landscape characteristics, and geological and biological 
features, as well as objects of deep cultural and educational value.
In 1100 A.D., the area's cultivated fields and settlements extended from 
the valley floors to the mesa tops. The pinnacles, Chimney Rock and 
Companion Rock, dominated the landscape. Today, peregrine falcons nest 
on the pinnacles and soar over ancient structures, the dramatic 
landscape, and the forested slopes of the Piedra River and Stolsteimer 
Creek drainages, which are all framed by the high peaks of the San Juan 
Mountains.
Migratory mule deer and elk herds pass through the area each fall and 
spring as they have for thousands of years, and live there during the 
critical

[[Page 129]]

winter months. Merriam's turkeys, river otters, bald eagles, golden 
eagles, mountain lions, bats, woodpeckers, and many species of migratory 
birds also live in the area among the Ponderosa Pine, pinon, and 
juniper. Several desert plants usually found farther south grow there, 
including a species of cholla cactus that does not occur naturally 
outside the Sonoran Desert and is believed to be associated with 
deliberate cultivation by the Ancestral Pueblo People.
The Chimney Rock site is one of the best recognized archaeoastronomical 
resources in North America. Virtually all building clusters have views 
of Chimney Rock and Companion Rock, which frame multiple astronomical 
alignments and illustrate the Ancestral Pueblo People's knowledge of 
astronomy. Hundreds of archaeological ruins and buildings from the 
Pueblo II period are within the boundaries of the site, including a 
Chaco-style communal multi-room ``great house'' built in the late 
eleventh century to command observations of the surrounding landscape 
and astronomical phenomena.
The Chimney Rock site features an isolated Chacoan settlement among a 
complex system of dispersed communities bound by economic, political, 
and religious interdependence centered in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, 
about 100 miles south of Chimney Rock. Chimney Rock continues to 
contribute to our knowledge about the Ancestral Pueblo People and their 
understanding and command of their environment.
Today, descendants of the Ancestral Pueblo People return to this 
important place of cultural continuity to visit their ancestors and for 
other spiritual and traditional purposes. It is a living landscape that 
shapes those who visit it and brings people together across time. Since 
the 1920s, there has been significant archaeological interest in Chimney 
Rock. Because it does not appear to have been reoccupied after the early 
1100s, Chimney Rock offers a valuable window into the cultural 
developments of the Pueblo II era and affords opportunities to 
understand how geology, ecology, and archaeology interrelate. Because 
visitors travel from areas near and far, these lands support a growing 
travel and tourism sector that is a source of economic opportunity for 
the community, especially businesses in the region. They also help to 
attract new residents, retirees, and businesses that will further 
diversify the local economy.
In 1970, Chimney Rock was listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places, and its spectacular landscape has been open to visitors ever 
since.
WHEREAS section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act''), authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled 
by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
WHEREAS it is in the public interest to preserve and protect the objects 
of scientific and historic interest at Chimney Rock;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Antiquities 
Act,

[[Page 130]]

hereby proclaim, set apart, and reserve as the Chimney Rock National 
Monument (monument) the objects identified above and all lands and 
interests in lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United 
States within the boundaries described on the accompanying map entitled 
``Chimney Rock National Monument'' and the accompanying legal 
description, which are attached to and form a part of this proclamation, 
for the purpose of protecting those objects. These reserved Federal 
lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 4,726 acres, which 
is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of 
the objects to be protected.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the

location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the 
public lands laws, including withdrawal from location, entry, and patent 
under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to 
mineral and geothermal leasing. Lands and interests in lands within the 
monument's boundaries not owned or controlled by the United States shall 
be reserved as part of the monument upon acquisition of ownership or 
control by the United States.
The establishment of this monument is subject to valid existing rights. 
The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior shall manage development 
under existing oil and gas leases within the monument, subject to valid 
existing rights, so as not to create any new impacts that would 
interfere with the proper care and management of the objects protected 
by this proclamation.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to alter the valid 
existing water rights of any party, including the United States.
The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) shall manage the monument 
through the Forest Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, 
consistent with the purposes and provisions of this proclamation. The 
Secretary shall prepare, within 3 years of the date of this 
proclamation, a management plan for the monument, and shall promulgate 
such regulations for its management as deemed appropriate. The plan will 
provide for protection and interpretation of the scientific and historic 
objects identified above, and continued public access to those objects, 
consistent with their protection. The plan will protect and preserve 
access by tribal members for traditional cultural, spiritual, and food- 
and medicine-gathering purposes, consistent with the purposes of the 
monument, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
The Secretary shall prepare a transportation plan that addresses actions 
necessary to protect the objects identified in this proclamation, 
including road closures and travel restrictions. For the purpose of 
protecting the objects identified above, the Secretary shall limit all 
motorized and mechanized vehicle use to designated roads, except for 
emergency or authorized administrative purposes.
The Secretary shall, in developing any management plans and any 
management rules and regulations governing the monument, consult with 
the Secretary of the Interior. The final decision to issue any 
management plans and any management rules and regulations rests with the 
Secretary of Agriculture. Management plans or rules and regulations 
developed by the Secretary of the Interior governing uses within 
national parks or other national

[[Page 131]]

monuments administered by the Secretary of the Interior shall not apply 
within the monument.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to enlarge or diminish the 
jurisdiction of the State of Colorado with respect to fish and wildlife 
management.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to enlarge or diminish the 
rights of any Indian tribe.
Laws, regulations, and policies followed by the Forest Service in 
issuing and administering grazing permits or leases on all lands under 
its jurisdiction shall continue to apply with regard to the lands in the 
monument.
The Secretary may carry out vegetative management treatments within the 
monument, except that timber harvest and prescribed fire may only be 
used when the Secretary determines it appropriate to address the risk of 
wildfire, insect infestation, or disease that would endanger the 
monument or imperil public safety.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing 
withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the national 
monument shall be the dominant reservation.
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, 
injure, destroy, or remove any feature of the monument and not to locate 
or settle upon any of the lands thereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8869 of September 21, 2012

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The founders of our Nation's first colleges and universities for African 
Americans shared a fundamental belief that, with the right education, 
all people can overcome barriers of injustice to achieve their fullest 
potential. These pioneers understood that education means emancipation--
a path to freedom, independence, and success. More than 150 years later, 
America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) carry 
forward this proud legacy, and this week, we celebrate the profound 
impact these places of learning have made on the life of our country.
For generations, HBCUs have provided students with access to higher 
education and instilled in them a sense of pride and history. Graduates 
of these institutions have played an extraordinary role in shaping the 
progress of our Union by championing equality and changing perspectives 
through the arts. They have strengthened our Nation by building our 
economy, teaching our children, healing the sick, and defending America 
as members of our Armed Forces. Today, HBCUs continue to help move our 
country forward, cultivating leaders in every area of our society. And 
with each new HBCU alum, we move closer to achieving our goal of having 
the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020.
During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, as we 
recognize the immeasurable contributions of these institutions, let us 
recommit to ensuring they remain cradles of opportunity for the next 
generation. Let us also reaffirm our belief in the power of progress 
through education--a belief we share with the visionary leaders who 
established our HBCUs so many years ago.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 23 through 
September 29, 2012, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon educators, public officials, professional 
organizations, corporations, and all Americans to observe this week with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the 
countless contributions these institutions and their alumni have made to 
our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8870 of September 21, 2012

National Hunting and Fishing Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From our highest peaks and most historic parks to the quiet woods and 
streams where generations of families have connected with the land 
around them, America's great outdoors have always played an important 
role in our national life. On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we 
celebrate our rich legacy of conservation, recognize sportsmen and women 
who have carried that legacy forward, and renew the spirit of 
stewardship that has moved countless Americans to help preserve our 
natural heritage for future generations.
As keepers of an age-old tradition, sportsmen and women share a deep and 
abiding bond with our environment. Generations have worked tirelessly to 
protect the lands and waters they cherish, and today, hunters and 
anglers stand among our strongest conservation advocates. This year, we 
also mark the 75th anniversary of the Federal Aid in Wildlife 
Restoration Act, which provided permanent and dependable funding for 
habitat conservation. This milestone recalls the many ways sportsmen and 
women have contributed to conservation of the public lands we all enjoy. 
Their legacy is all around us, and as we take time to appreciate 
America's natural beauty, let us give thanks to all those who have 
helped make our country what it is today.
Fulfilling our role as environmental stewards in the 21st century 
demands that we find the best ideas at the grassroots level and empower 
States, communities, and nonprofits with the tools they need to protect 
the land they love. Through the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, my 
Administration has striven to meet those challenges and lay the 
foundation for a comprehensive, community-driven conservation strategy. 
From hunters and anglers to tribal leaders and young people, we are 
engaging stakeholders of all backgrounds and beliefs--and moving 
forward, we will continue to find new ways to make the Federal 
Government a better partner in preserving our environment today and 
tomorrow.
As Americans, each of us has an equal share in the land and an equal 
responsibility to protect it. On National Hunting and Fishing Day, we 
pay tribute to the community of sportsmen and women who have kept faith 
with that fundamental principle, and who will continue to help drive our 
environmental progress in the years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 22, 2012, as 
National Hunting and Fishing Day. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8871 of September 28, 2012

National Public Lands Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When Thomas Jefferson described the view from Monticello in 1786, he 
wrote, ``How sublime to look down into the workhouse of nature, to see 
her clouds, hail, snow, rain, thunder, all fabricated at our feet!'' 
Though much has changed in the years since our third President put those 
words to paper, the sense of awe and reverence he expressed still 
courses through the American spirit. Our expansive landscapes remain an 
inspiration for all to behold, and as an essential piece of our 
heritage, it is incumbent upon us to protect them not only in our time, 
but for all time.
Today, thousands of Americans will take up that task by volunteering to 
care for our public lands. Cities and communities across our country 
will join together to restore the lands and waters we share, and 
families nationwide will explore the natural splendor that stretches 
from our Atlantic shores to the Pacific's rocky coasts. As we take time 
to connect with America's great outdoors in urban and rural areas alike, 
we are reminded of the varied roles our public lands play in our 
national life. These areas boost tourism and contribute to public 
health; they power local economies, fuel tomorrow's energy solutions, 
and serve as critical havens of biodiversity; and just as they always 
have, our public lands remain places of irreplaceable beauty. Through 
the America's Great Outdoors initiative, my Administration has worked to 
expand access to these important spaces while ensuring they are 
protected for future generations, and moving forward, we will continue 
to advance that vital mission.
The rugged grandeur of the American landscape has helped shape our 
character and our soul as a Nation. As we celebrate this National Public 
Lands Day, let us reflect on the lands and waters that so deeply enrich 
our experience, and let us renew our commitment to protecting them in 
the years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 29, 2012, as 
National Public Lands Day. I encourage all Americans to participate in a 
day of public service for our lands.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8872 of September 28, 2012

Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the revolution that gave life to our Republic to the trials of our 
times, our men and women in uniform have put themselves in harm's way to 
defend the people they love and the land they cherish. Their actions 
attest not only to the depth of their sacrifice, but also to a belief in 
their country so profound they were willing to give their lives for it. 
Today, we pay solemn tribute to all who did. Sons and daughters, fathers 
and mothers, husbands and wives, they were all patriots--and with a 
devotion to duty that goes without equal, these proud Americans gave of 
themselves until they had nothing more to give.
As a grateful Nation honors our fallen service members, so do we honor 
the families who keep their memory burning bright. They are parents who 
face the loss of a child, spouses who carry an emptiness that cannot be 
filled, children who know sorrow that defies comprehension. The grief 
they hold in their hearts is a grief most cannot fully know. But as 
fellow Americans, we must lend our strength to those families who have 
given so much for our country. Their burdens are ones that no one should 
have to bear alone, and it is up to all of us to live our lives in a way 
worthy of their sacrifice.
On this day of remembrance, let us rededicate ourselves to upholding the 
sacred trust we share with our Gold Star families and the heroes we have 
laid to rest. Let us always remember that the blessings we enjoy as free 
people in a free society came at a dear cost. Let us hold the memories 
of our fallen close to our hearts, and let us mark each day by heeding 
the example they set. Finally, let us forever keep faith with our men 
and women in uniform, our veterans, and our military families by serving 
them as well as they have served us. Our Union endures because of their 
courage and selflessness, and today, we resolve anew to show them the 
care and support they so deeply deserve.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1985 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold 
Star Mother's Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 30, 2012, as 
Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day. I call upon all Government 
officials to display the flag of the United States over Government 
buildings on this special day. I also encourage the American people to 
display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public expression 
of our Nation's sympathy and respect for our Gold Star Mothers and 
Families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the

Proclamation 8873 of October 1, 2012

National Arts and Humanities Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

After the bombing of Fort McHenry during the War of 1812, a young lawyer 
named Francis Scott Key reached for his pen and captured the resilience 
of the American people. His poem became our National Anthem, and almost 
two centuries later, it continues to speak to the American spirit just 
as it did on that September day so long ago. Throughout our history, the 
arts and humanities have given us comfort and confidence, drawn us 
together, and called on us to strive for a more perfect Union. This 
month, we celebrate our Nation's rich artistic heritage.
Artistic expression and memorable ideas can resonate with us, challenge 
us, and teach us important lessons about ourselves and each other. At 
their best, great works of literature, theater, dance, fine art, and 
music reflect something common in all of us. They open dialogues between 
cultures and raise poignant questions about our world. They are also 
vital components of our children's education and our national growth--
not only teaching our youth to observe closely, interpret creatively, 
and think critically, but also bringing new cultural experiences to our 
communities and helping drive economic progress. That is why my 
Administration is committed to strengthening arts and humanities 
programs in schools and communities across our Nation.
When children read their first book, pick up their first instrument, or 
perform in their first play, they demonstrate the power of the arts to 
ignite wonder and imagination. This month, let us pledge to invest in 
America's next generation by ensuring our children have the opportunity 
to participate in and enjoy the arts and humanities. If we give them the 
tools to create and innovate, they will do their part to disrupt our 
views, challenge our perceptions, and stir us to be our best selves.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2012 as 
National Arts and Humanities Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to join together in observing this month with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs to celebrate the arts and the 
humanities in America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8874 of October 1, 2012

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Breast cancer touches the lives of Americans from every background and 
in every community across our Nation. Though we have made great strides 
in combatting this devastating illness, more than 200,000 women will be 
diagnosed with breast cancer this year, and tens of thousands are 
expected to lose their lives to the disease. During National Breast 
Cancer Awareness Month, we honor those we have lost, lend our strength 
to those who carry on the fight, and pledge to educate ourselves and our 
loved ones about this tragic disease.
Though the exact causes of breast cancer are unknown, understanding its 
risk factors is essential to prevention. Older women and those who have 
a personal or family history of breast cancer are among those at greater 
risk of developing the illness. Early detection is also key in the fight 
against breast cancer. Getting recommended screening mammograms can help 
to detect breast cancer early. I encourage women and men to speak with 
their health care provider about breast cancer, and to visit 
www.Cancer.gov to learn more about symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.
My Administration remains committed to ensuring access to quality health 
care that includes preventive services for women. Thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act, many health plans are required to cover mammograms 
and other recommended cancer screenings without co-pays or deductibles. 
Starting in 2014, it will also ensure that no American can be denied 
health insurance because of a pre-existing condition--including breast 
cancer.
This month, we stand with the mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, and 
friends who have been affected by breast cancer, and we recognize the 
ongoing efforts of dedicated advocates, researchers, and health care 
providers who strive each day to defeat this terrible disease. In memory 
of the loved ones we have lost and inspired by the resilience of those 
living with the disease, let us strengthen our resolve to lead our 
Nation toward a future free from cancer in all its forms.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2012 as 
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage citizens, government 
agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and all other 
interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of 
what Americans can do to prevent breast cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8875 of October 1, 2012

National Cybersecurity Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, Americans are more connected to each other and to people around 
the world than ever before. Many of us depend on the Internet and 
digital tools in our daily lives--from shopping at home and banking on 
our mobile devices to sharing information with friends across the globe. 
And America far outpaces the rest of the world in adoption of cutting-
edge wireless broadband technology. Our growing reliance on technology 
reminds us that our digital infrastructure is not just a convenience; it 
is a strategic national asset. During National Cybersecurity Awareness 
Month, we recommit to ensuring our information and infrastructure remain 
secure, reliable, and resilient.
Though our Nation benefits immensely from the Internet, increased 
connectivity brings increased risk of theft, fraud, and abuse. That is 
why my Administration has made cybersecurity a national and economic 
security priority. By bringing together Federal, State, and local 
governments and private industry partners, we have made great progress 
in securing cyberspace for business, education, entertainment, and civic 
life. In November 2011, we released the Blueprint for a Secure Cyber 
Future--a strategic plan to protect government, the private sector, and 
the public against cyber threats today and tomorrow.
As we continue to improve our cybersecurity under existing authorities, 
comprehensive legislation remains essential to securing our critical 
infrastructure, facilitating greater cyber information sharing between 
government and the private sector, and protecting the privacy and civil 
liberties of the American people. My Administration looks forward to 
working with the Congress to address these goals.
Cybersecurity cannot be guaranteed by government, industry, and law 
enforcement alone. Each of us has an important role to play in reducing 
the cyber threat and increasing our resilience following cyber 
incidents. The Department of Homeland Security's ``Stop.Think.Connect.'' 
campaign continues to empower digital citizens with the information and 
tools they need to stay safe online. To learn more about how we can all 
contribute to the security of our shared cyber networks, visit 
www.DHS.gov/StopThinkConnect.
America's digital infrastructure underpins our progress toward 
strengthening our economy, improving our schools, modernizing our 
military, and making our government more open and efficient. Working 
together, we can embrace the opportunities and meet the challenges 
cyberspace provides while preserving America's fundamental belief in 
freedom, openness, and innovation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2012 as 
National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to recognize the importance of cybersecurity and to 
observe this

[[Page 142]]

month with activities, events, and trainings that will enhance our 
national security and resilience.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8876 of October 1, 2012

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the 22 years since the signing of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, we have made significant progress in giving all Americans the 
freedom to make of our lives what we will. Yet, in times of prosperity 
as well as challenge, people with disabilities have had fewer 
opportunities in our workplaces than those without. As we work to 
revitalize our economy, it is essential that each of us can bring our 
talents, expertise, and passion to bear in the marketplace. But a 
stronger economy is not enough; we must ensure not only full 
participation, but also full opportunity. During National Disability 
Employment Awareness Month, we recognize the indispensable contributions 
people with disabilities make in our economy and recommit to building a 
country where each of us can realize the full extent of our dreams.
Because America's workforce should reflect the diversity of its people--
including people with disabilities--my Administration remains committed 
to helping our businesses, schools, and communities support our entire 
workforce. To meet this challenge, the Federal Government must be a 
model employer. That is why I was proud to sign an Executive Order in 
2010 that called on Federal agencies to increase recruitment, hiring, 
and retention of people with disabilities. In 2012, the Office of 
Personnel Management reported on our progress, revealing that we are 
moving toward meeting our goal of hiring an additional 100,000 people 
with disabilities into the Federal workforce over 5 years. Today, more 
people with disabilities work for the Federal Government than at any 
time in the past 20 years, and we are striving to make it easier to get 
and keep those jobs by improving compliance with Section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act.
All Americans are entitled to an accessible workplace, a level playing 
field, and the same privileges, pursuits, and opportunities as any of 
their family, friends, and neighbors. This month, let us rededicate 
ourselves to bringing down barriers and raising up aspirations for all 
our people, regardless of disability, so we may share in a brighter 
future together.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2012 as 
National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to 
embrace

[[Page 143]]

the talents and skills that individuals with disabilities bring to our 
workplaces and communities and to promote the right to equal employment 
opportunity for all people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8877 of October 1, 2012

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For far too long, domestic violence was ignored or treated as a private 
matter where victims were left to suffer in silence without hope of 
intervention. As we mark the 18th anniversary of the landmark Violence 
Against Women Act, authored by Vice President Joe Biden, we reflect on 
how far we have come. We have made significant progress in changing laws 
and attitudes, providing support to survivors, and reducing the 
incidence of domestic violence. But we also know that we have not come 
far enough, and that there is more work left to be done. During National 
Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we stand with all those who have been 
affected by this terrible crime, recognize the individuals and groups 
who have stepped forward to break the cycle of violence, and recommit to 
putting an end to domestic violence in America.
Despite considerable progress in reducing domestic violence, an average 
of three women in the United States lose their lives every day as a 
result of these unconscionable acts. And while women between the ages of 
16 and 24 are among the most vulnerable to intimate partner violence, 
domestic violence affects people regardless of gender, age, sexual 
orientation, race, or religion. Tragically, without intervention, 
children exposed to such violence can suffer serious long-term 
consequences that may include difficulty in school, post-traumatic 
disorders, alcohol and drug abuse, and criminal behavior.
My Administration remains committed to getting victims the help they 
need, from emergency shelter and legal assistance to transitional 
housing and services for children. We are also working to stop violence 
before it starts. Last year, agencies across the Federal Government held 
town hall meetings nationwide to promote men's roles in ending violence 
against women. Through Vice President Biden's 1is2many initiative, we 
built on that progress earlier this year by releasing a public service 
announcement that features professional athletes and other role models 
speaking out against dating violence. This April, I directed leaders 
throughout my Administration to increase efforts to prevent and combat 
domestic violence involving Federal employees and address its effects on 
the Federal workforce. Since August, the Affordable Care Act has 
required most insurance plans to make domestic violence screening and 
counseling available as a preventive service for women--without co-
payments, deductibles, or other cost-

[[Page 144]]

sharing. And most recently, we developed a new initiative to reduce 
domestic violence homicides through high risk screening and linking 
victims with services. Moreover, my Administration looks forward to 
working with the Congress to strengthen and reauthorize the Violence 
Against Women Act.
While government must do its part, all Americans can play a role in 
ending domestic violence. Each of us can promote healthy relationships, 
speak out when we see injustice in our communities, stand with survivors 
we know, and change attitudes that perpetuate the cycle of abuse. We 
must also ensure that survivors of domestic violence know they are not 
alone, and that there are resources available to them. I encourage 
victims, their loved ones, and concerned citizens to learn more by 
calling the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE, or by 
visiting www.TheHotline.org.
This month, let us renew our efforts to support victims of domestic 
violence in their time of greatest need, and to realize an America where 
no one lives in fear because they feel unsafe in their own home.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2012 as 
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to 
speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist 
victims of these crimes in finding the help and healing they need.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8878 of October 1, 2012

National Energy Action Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A secure energy future is vital to an economy built to last. When we use 
American energy to power our homes, businesses, and vehicles, we create 
new American jobs, grow new American industries, and safeguard our 
national security and our economic potential. As demand for energy 
increases worldwide, our Nation must continue to lead the world in a 
rapidly evolving energy market by pursuing safe and responsible domestic 
energy production, promoting efficiency, and developing clean energy and 
renewable fuels.
My Administration is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy to put energy 
independence within our reach and power a sustainable, vibrant economy. 
We took bold action to double our use of renewable energy sources like 
solar, wind, and geothermal; finalized new standards to nearly double 
the fuel efficiency of our Nation's automobiles by 2025; and invested in 
energy-

[[Page 145]]

saving upgrades in homes, public buildings, and businesses across our 
Nation. These programs spur innovation, make American manufacturers more 
competitive, and save families money on their energy bills.
As we lay the foundation for a clean energy economy, we must also take 
advantage of the abundant energy resources we have here at home and 
reduce our dependence on oil imports. That is why my Administration 
continues to open millions of acres for oil and gas exploration. Today, 
domestic oil production is at the highest level in nearly a decade, 
while oil imports have fallen to the lowest level in nearly 20 years.
Thanks to pioneering new technologies developed right here at home, 
America is also now the world's leading producer of natural gas. As 
production has increased, it has boosted our manufacturing, dramatically 
reduced prices, and created more jobs for the American people. Along 
with advances in renewable energy and increased efficiency, our 
investments in natural gas can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions that 
cause climate change.
Moving forward, we will continue to invest in new technologies that put 
Americans to work in the jobs of tomorrow--from building advanced wind 
turbines and long-lasting batteries to developing cutting-edge clean 
coal technologies and next generation biofuels. We will promote growth 
and job creation throughout the entire energy sector by further 
developing our domestic energy resources and supporting our nuclear 
industry. And we will modernize our electric grid, allowing us to better 
integrate renewable energy, increase efficiency and reliability, and 
empower families to make informed decisions about their energy 
consumption.
Finally, we must also harness our greatest natural resource--the 
creativity, drive, and entrepreneurial spirit of the American people. 
Across our country, scientists and engineers are laying the groundwork 
for the next big energy breakthrough, farmers across rural America are 
producing homegrown fuels, students are promoting conservation in their 
communities, and autoworkers are manufacturing the next generation of 
fuel-efficient cars. If we continue to invest in American potential, I 
am confident that new plants and factories will dot our landscape and 
new energy will power our future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2012 as 
National Energy Action Month. I call upon the citizens of the United 
States to recognize this month by working together to achieve greater 
energy security, a more robust economy, and a healthier environment for 
our children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8879 of October 1, 2012

National Substance Abuse Prevention Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, far too many Americans are hurt by alcohol and drug abuse. 
From diminished achievement in our schools, to greater risks on our 
roads and in our communities, to the heartache of lives cut tragically 
short, the consequences of substance abuse are profound. Yet, we also 
know that they are preventable. This month, we pay tribute to all those 
working to prevent substance abuse in our communities, and we rededicate 
ourselves to building a safer, drug-free America.
By stopping drug use before it starts, we can prevent the disease of 
addiction and create stronger neighborhoods across our country. My 
Administration has placed prevention at the heart of our National Drug 
Control Strategy, promoting a balanced approach that advances evidence-
based public health and safety reforms. We have invested in outreach 
programs that empower young Americans with the facts about substance 
abuse, and we have worked to stem the tide of prescription drug abuse 
through education, monitoring, proper disposal, and enforcement. We have 
also worked to develop a nationwide, community-based prevention system 
that joins stakeholders at every level of government with local 
organizations that can deliver local solutions.
All of us can play a role in preventing drug and alcohol abuse. As our 
children's first teachers, parents and guardians can help by talking to 
their kids about the dangers of substance abuse. Alongside them, 
coalitions of teachers, faith-based groups, health care providers, law 
enforcement officials, and other local leaders are joining together to 
address substance abuse in their communities. As we observe National 
Substance Abuse Prevention Month, let us join in those vital efforts and 
reaffirm our vision for an America where each of us has the fullest 
opportunity to live in health and happiness.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2012 as 
National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to 
engage in appropriate programs and activities to promote comprehensive 
substance abuse prevention efforts within their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8880 of October 1, 2012

Child Health Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we share an obligation to ensure the health and well-being 
of our children. The youth of today will shape America's tomorrow, and 
on Child Health Day, we rededicate ourselves to providing our next 
generation with access to the quality health care and clean environment 
that will nurture their future success.
My Administration has made the health of our Nation's children a top 
priority. Because of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no 
longer deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions. The law 
also allows young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance plan 
until age 26, which has brought coverage to more than 3 million 
Americans. My Administration has also taken action to ensure all our 
children can attend schools that are safe, where we address bullying and 
end the myth that it is a simple rite of passage. And through First Lady 
Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative, we are joining with parents, 
schools, and community leaders to address childhood obesity.
A safe environment in which our children can live and grow is also 
essential to their well-being. Because clean water is the foundation for 
healthy communities, we are working to reduce contaminants in our 
drinking water by updating standards and better protecting our water 
sources from pollution. We are also building on the successes of the 
Clean Air Act to improve our air quality and help decrease harmful 
toxins that can lead to acute bronchitis, asthma, cancer, and impaired 
development.
On Child Health Day, we are reminded that by giving our children a 
healthy start in life, we put them and our Nation on the path to a 
successful future. As we mark this important occasion, let us reaffirm 
our commitment to meeting that most fundamental responsibility.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in 
October as Child Health Day and has requested the President to issue a 
proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 1, 2012, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon families, child health professionals, faith-based and 
community organizations, and all levels of government to help ensure 
America's children stay healthy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8881 of October 5, 2012

Fire Prevention Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every year, fires in and around homes nationwide put thousands of 
Americans in harm's way. From the loss of a home to the tragic passing 
of a loved one, the devastation these disasters leave in their wake is 
heartbreaking. During Fire Prevention Week, we resolve to protect 
ourselves, our families, and our communities from fires, and we honor 
the courageous first responders who put their lives at risk to keep us 
safe.
All of us can take meaningful steps to reduce the risk of fire in our 
homes. I encourage all Americans to install and maintain smoke alarms, 
test smoke alarm batteries regularly, and follow safe practices in the 
kitchen and when using electrical appliances. Families should also 
develop and practice a fire escape plan that includes at least two ways 
out of every room. To learn more about these and other simple 
precautions against home fires, visit www.Ready.gov.
This year, wildfires caused profound damage to communities across our 
country, and our Nation mourned the loss of life that followed. These 
events reminded us that wildfires are often unpredictable, which is why 
it is essential for people in areas at risk to practice proper fire 
prevention and preparedness. Those who live in regions prone to wildfire 
can take action by clearing flammable vegetation, preparing an emergency 
supply kit, and sharing evacuation routes and a communications plan with 
their family in case of emergency. Individuals who see a wildfire should 
report it by calling 911, and if advised, evacuate immediately.
As we mark Fire Prevention Week by recommitting to preparedness, we also 
extend our thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected by 
fires this year--including the brave first responders who fought them. 
Summoning courage in crisis and bringing discipline and professionalism 
to the job each and every day, America's firefighters are heroes in 
every sense. This week, we express our deepest gratitude for their 
service to our communities and our Nation, and we pay solemn tribute to 
the men and women who gave their lives to protect our own. Their 
sacrifice will never be forgotten, and in their memory, let us 
rededicate ourselves to preventing tragedy before it strikes.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 7 through 
October 13, 2012, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 7, 2012, 
in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will 
be flown at half-staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the 
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans 
to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and 
activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their 
tragic consequences.

Proclamation 8882 of October 5, 2012

Columbus Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As dawn broke over the Atlantic on October 12, 1492, a perilous 10-week 
journey across an ocean gave way to encounters and events that would 
dramatically shape the course of history. Today, we recall the courage 
and the innovative spirit that carried Christopher Columbus and his crew 
from a Spanish port to North America, and we celebrate our heritage as a 
people born of many histories and traditions.
When the explorers laid anchor in the Bahamas, they met indigenous 
peoples who had inhabited the Western hemisphere for millennia. As we 
reflect on the tragic burdens tribal communities bore in the years that 
followed, let us commemorate the many contributions they have made to 
the American experience, and let us continue to strengthen the ties that 
bind us today.
In the centuries since that fateful October day in 1492, countless 
pioneering Americans have summoned the same spirit of discovery that 
drove Christopher Columbus when he cast off from Palos, Spain, to pursue 
the unknown. Engineers and entrepreneurs, sailors and scientists, 
explorers of the physical world and chroniclers of the human spirit--all 
have worked to broaden our understanding of the time and space we live 
in and who we are as a people. On this 520th anniversary of Columbus's 
expedition to the West, let us press forward with renewed determination 
toward tomorrow's new frontiers.
As a native of Genoa, Italy, Christopher Columbus also inspired 
generations of Italian immigrants to follow in his footsteps. Today, we 
take time to celebrate the innumerable contributions that generations of 
Italian Americans have made to our country. Throughout 2013, Italy will 
also commemorate this rich heritage and the enduring bonds between our 
countries with the Year of Italian Culture in the United States, which 
Americans will join in celebrating.
In commemoration of Christopher Columbus's historic voyage 520 years 
ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified 
in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President 
proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 8, 2012, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be

[[Page 150]]

displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of our 
diverse history and all who have contributed to shaping this Nation.

Proclamation 8883 of October 5, 2012

German-American Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

United by dreams of freedom, opportunity, and better lives for their 
families, generations of immigrants have crossed land and sea to pursue 
the American promise. With unfailing hope for the future they knew was 
possible here, German Americans have shared in that promise and 
contributed immeasurably to our Nation.
During the more than three centuries since the first German settlers 
arrived in North America, German immigrants and their descendants have 
played a vital role in every part of our society. With each generation, 
they have passed on to their children and grandchildren an enduring 
commitment to hard work, civic engagement, and family. Many German 
traditions are so ingrained in our Nation's story that many people are 
unaware of their origins, but the indelible mark they have left on the 
character of our country is unmistakable.
The United States is proud to count Germany as one of our closest and 
strongest allies. At its core, the alliance between our nations is a 
partnership between our peoples. For many years, citizens of both our 
countries--entrepreneurs, innovators, students, scientists, and 
soldiers--have worked together to forge a brighter future at home and 
around the world. Those bonds continue to grow stronger with lifelong 
connections cultivated through educational exchanges and valuable 
partnerships between our two nations. Today, we celebrate that spirit of 
collaboration, and we reflect on the innumerable ways generations of 
German Americans have enriched the American story.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2012, as 
German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the 
history of German Americans and reflect on the many contributions they 
have made to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8884 of October 8, 2012

Establishment of the C[eacute]sar E. Ch[aacute]vez National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The property in Keene, California, known as Nuestra Se[ntilde]ora Reina 
de la Paz (Our Lady Queen of Peace) (La Paz), is recognized for its 
historic significance to C[eacute]sar Estrada Ch[aacute]vez and the farm 
worker movement. C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez is one of the most revered 
civil rights leaders in the history of the United States. From humble 
beginnings in Yuma, Arizona, to the founding of the United Farm Workers 
(UFW) movement, C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez knew firsthand the hard work 
of farm workers in the fields across the United States and their 
contribution to feeding the Nation. He saw and experienced the difficult 
conditions and hardships that confronted farm worker families. And 
through his hard work, perseverance, and personal sacrifice, he 
dedicated his life to the struggle for respect and dignity for the farm 
workers of America.
His faith, his passion for nonviolence rooted in the teachings of Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mohandas Gandhi, and his inspirational 
leadership are best reflected in his own eloquent words: ``When the man 
who feeds the world by toiling in the fields is himself deprived of the 
basic rights of feeding, sheltering, and caring for his own family, the 
whole community of man is sick.''
La Paz served as the national headquarters of the UFW and the home and 
workplace of C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez, his family, union members, and 
supporters. It remains the symbol of the movement's most significant 
achievements and its expanding horizons.
In 1972, the UFW made La Paz its official national headquarters. With 
existing residential buildings, administrative spaces, maintenance 
shops, and supporting infrastructure from its former use as a 
tuberculosis sanatorium, the property supported a new community almost 
immediately. C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez and his family moved to the 
property, as did a fluctuating population of union employees, members, 
and supporters.
From the 1970s through C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez death in 1993, La Paz 
was at the forefront of the American farm worker movement. Thousands of 
farm workers and their supporters from California and across the country 
streamed through La Paz to meet with movement leaders, learn from other 
farm workers, devise strategies, negotiate contracts, receive training, 
volunteer their time, and celebrate meaningful events. Throughout this 
period, La Paz became a symbol of the accomplishments and broadening of 
the American farm worker movement.
At La Paz, members of the farm worker movement celebrated such victories 
as the passage of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, the 
first Federal law recognizing farm workers' collective bargaining 
rights. At La Paz, the UFW grew and expanded from its early roots as a 
union for farm workers to become a national voice for the poor and 
disenfranchised.

[[Page 152]]

For C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez, La Paz also provided the respite he 
needed to continue serving the farm worker movement. His attachment to 
La Paz as both a refuge and a place where he engaged in his life's work 
grew stronger over the years.
La Paz was a place where he and other farm worker leaders strategized 
and reflected on challenges the union was facing, celebrated victories 
and mourned losses, and watched the union endure and modernize. The 
building that is now the Visitor Center contains C[eacute]sar 
Ch[aacute]vez's office (which still houses original furnishings and 
artifacts), as well as the UFW legal aid offices. La Paz also was a 
place where he watched his children grow up, marry, and begin to raise 
children of their own. The home of C[eacute]sar and Helen Ch[aacute]vez 
remains at La Paz. That C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez wished to be buried 
at La Paz upon his death is an enduring testament to the strength of his 
association with the property. The Ch[aacute]vez Memorial Garden 
contains the grave site of C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez. Other buildings 
and structures at the La Paz campus, which is listed in the National 
Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark, 
are recognized as contributing to its historic significance.
This site marks the extraordinary achievements and contributions to the 
history of the United States made by C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez and the 
farm worker movement that he led with great vision and fortitude. La Paz 
reflects his conviction that ordinary people can do extraordinary 
things.
Whereas section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act''), authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled 
by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
Whereas Nuestra Se[ntilde]ora Reina de la Paz was designated a National 
Historic Landmark on October 8, 2012, establishing its national 
significance based on its association with C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez 
and the farm worker movement that he led;
Whereas the National Ch[aacute]vez Center and the C[eacute]sar 
Ch[aacute]vez Foundation have expressed support for establishing a unit 
of the National Park System at La Paz;
Whereas the National Ch[aacute]vez Center has donated to the United 
States certain lands and interests in lands at La Paz (including fee 
title in the Visitor Center that contains the office of C[eacute]sar 
Ch[aacute]vez and legal aid offices, C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez's home, 
and the Memorial Garden that includes the grave of C[eacute]sar 
Ch[aacute]vez, as well as an easement for the protection of and access 
to other historically significant buildings, structures, and associated 
landscapes located adjacent to the fee lands) for administration by the 
Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) in accordance with the provisions 
of the Antiquities Act and other applicable laws;
Whereas it is in the public interest to preserve the historic objects at 
La Paz;

[[Page 153]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Antiquities 
Act hereby proclaim, set apart, and reserve as the C[eacute]sar E. 
Ch[aacute]vez National Monument (monument) the objects identified above 
and all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled by the 
Government of the United States within the boundaries described on the 
accompanying map, which is attached to and forms a part of this 
proclamation. These reserved Federal lands and interests in lands 
encompass approximately 10.5 acres, together with appurtenant easements 
for all necessary purposes, which is the smallest area compatible with 
the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of this 
monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, 
location, selection, sale, leasing, or other disposition under the 
public lands laws, including withdrawal from location, entry, and patent 
under the mining laws, and from disposition under all laws relating to 
mineral and geothermal leasing.
The establishment of this monument is subject to valid existing rights. 
Lands and interests in lands within the monument's boundaries not owned 
or controlled by the United States shall be reserved as part of the 
monument upon acquisition of ownership or control by the United States.
The Secretary shall manage the monument through the National Park 
Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, consistent with the 
purposes and provisions of this proclamation. For the purpose of 
preserving, restoring, and enhancing the public visitation and 
appreciation of the monument, the Secretary shall prepare a management 
plan for the monument within 3 years of the date of this proclamation. 
The management plan will ensure that the monument fulfills the following 
purposes for the benefit of present and future generations: (1) to 
preserve the historic resources; (2) to commemorate the life and work of 
C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez; and (3) to interpret the struggles and 
achievements of the broader farm worker movement throughout the United 
States. The management plan shall, among other provisions, set forth the 
desired relationship of the monument to other related resources, 
programs, and organizations at La Paz, as well as at other sites 
significant to the farm worker movement, such as the Forty Acres 
National Historic Landmark site and the Filipino Community Hall in 
Delano, California, the Santa Rita Center in Phoenix, Arizona, and 
McDonnell Hall in San Jose, California, including march routes. The 
management planning process shall provide for maximum public 
involvement, including consultation with the National Ch[aacute]vez 
Center and the C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez Foundation, and shall identify 
steps to be taken to provide interpretive opportunities for the entirety 
of the National Historic Landmark District at La Paz and related sites 
as described above, where appropriate for a broader understanding of the 
farm worker movement.
The National Park Service shall consult with the National Ch[aacute]vez 
Center, the C[eacute]sar Ch[aacute]vez Foundation, and other appropriate 
organizations in planning for interpretation and visitor services at the 
monument. The National Park Service shall, in its interpretive 
programming, recognize the contributions of many people, cultures, and 
organizations to the farm worker movement, such as women, youth, and 
religious organizations. To the extent practicable and appropriate, the 
National Park Service shall seek to provide

[[Page 154]]

coordinated visitor services and interpretive opportunities with the 
National Ch[aacute]vez Center throughout the La Paz site, on property 
owned and managed by the National Ch[aacute]vez Center as well as on 
property administered by the National Park Service. The National Park 
Service is directed to use applicable authorities to seek to enter into 
agreements with the National Ch[aacute]vez Center to address common 
interests, including provision of visitor services, interpretation and 
education, establishment and care of museum collections, and care of 
historic resources.
Further, to the extent authorized by law, the Secretary shall promulgate 
any additional regulations needed for the proper care and management of 
the monument.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing 
withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the monument shall 
be the dominant reservation.
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, 
injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to 
locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8885 of October 9, 2012

Leif Erikson Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Leif Erikson--son of Iceland and grandson of Norway--crossed the North 
Atlantic more than 1,000 years ago to land on the shores of present-day 
Canada. His arrival marked the first known European encounter with North 
America and began a legacy of daring exploration that would help define 
the character of our Nation. Today, we celebrate not only Leif Erikson 
and Nordic-American culture, but also those men and women who boldly 
reach for the next great discovery.
More than 800 years after that first excursion, a ship called 
Restauration set sail in Erikson's wake with the eyes and hearts of its 
passengers set on American shores. The Norwegians who disembarked in New 
York City on October 9, 1825, were the first large group of immigrants 
to arrive in the United States from Norway. On Leif Erikson Day, we 
commemorate their journey and celebrate the many contributions and 
accomplishments of their descendants.
Famed adventurers like Leif Erikson still spur our limitless desire to 
push toward new frontiers and shed light on the unknown. Today, the 
United States is driving extraordinary innovation in all realms of 
science and technology, setting out on modern expeditions to research 
and preserve the Arctic and Antarctic, and even sending robotic 
explorers to the surface of Mars. As we strive for an ever brighter 
future, may we continue to be inspired by the rugged determination that 
motivated our forebears, and may the same spirit of exploration guide 
our progress in the years to come.
To honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the 
Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 
2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim 
October 9 of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2012, as Leif Erikson Day. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8886 of October 9, 2012

50th Anniversary of the Office of the United States Trade Representative

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On October 11, 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed the Trade 
Expansion Act--a landmark piece of legislation that established a 
Special Representative for Trade Negotiations who would be tasked with 
promoting and securing trade agreements with partner countries around 
the world. Fifty years after that historic event, the Office of the 
United States Trade Representative (USTR) continues to play a vital role 
in advancing trade policy that opens new markets for American exports, 
and that creates and supports jobs right here at home.
Throughout its history, USTR has worked to level the playing field for 
American workers and create more opportunities for our businesses to 
compete in global markets. The agency has supported America's commitment 
to market-based competition and innovation, helping draw good jobs and 
growing industries to our shores. USTR has striven to promote stability, 
transparency, high standards, and accountability in international trade.
Today, USTR continues to monitor and enforce our existing trade 
agreements to ensure trading partners honor their commitments. USTR 
successfully secured important improvements to our trade agreements with 
Korea, Colombia, and Panama that I proudly signed into law last year. 
The agency's efforts to expand trade remain a vital part of my 
Administration's strategy for an economy built to last.
On this anniversary, we recognize the dedicated professionals who have 
upheld USTR's mission for half a century, and we applaud their ongoing 
work to make America the best place in the world to innovate, invest, 
work, and build a business.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2012, as 
the 50th Anniversary of the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that recognize the 
Office of the United States Trade Representative for its many 
contributions to strengthening American leadership in the global trading 
system.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8887 of October 11, 2012

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Two hundred and thirty-three years ago, a Polish-born patriot gave his 
life to advance the cause of American independence. As a leader in the 
Continental Army who fought shoulder-to-shoulder with men from Europe 
and America alike, Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski battled to extend 
the principles that were as dear to him as they are to us--liberty, 
equality, and justice for all. Today, we reflect on the proud legacy he 
left behind, and we celebrate the lasting ways Polish Americans have 
enriched our Nation.
In his native Poland, Casimir Pulaski strove to secure sovereignty for 
his country. Years of struggle came to an end when his confederation was 
overpowered, leaving him an exile to France. In Paris, General Pulaski 
met Benjamin Franklin, who directed him toward another fight for freedom 
taking place across the Atlantic.
When Franklin wrote to General George Washington to recommend Casimir 
Pulaski as a volunteer in the American cavalry, he noted that Pulaski 
``was renowned throughout Europe for the courage and bravery he 
displayed in defense of his country's freedom.'' Though the soil he 
fought for was not his own, the founding ideals of our young Republic 
were ones General Pulaski shared with all who saw freedom's promise. For 
his heroic actions on battlefields that spanned from Brandywine to 
Charleston, Casimir Pulaski was promoted to the rank of Brigadier 
General and became known as the ``Father of the American Cavalry.'' 
Tragically, he did not live to see the success of the revolution he gave 
so much to advance. Today, we see the future he helped create: a free 
and independent United States standing proudly with its strong ally, a 
free and independent Poland.
On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we honor a hero who helped secure our 
country's fate when it was most fragile. As we recall his tremendous 
contributions, let us also pay tribute to the countless Polish Americans 
who followed his bold example. Generations have contributed mightily to 
building the country we know and love today, and they will continue to 
play an important role in carrying us toward a more perfect Union in the 
years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2012, as 
General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to commemorate 
this occasion with appropriate programs and activities paying tribute to 
Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who defend the freedom of our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8888 of October 12, 2012

National School Lunch Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our children are the key to America's success in the 21st century, and 
it is incumbent upon us all to ensure they have the resources they need 
to reach their greatest potential--including access to healthy meals at 
school. During National School Lunch Week, we recognize all those whose 
dedicated work and care make good nutrition a reality for our sons and 
daughters.
Our students deserve the best possible chance to live healthy, 
productive lives. Since the National School Lunch Program was founded 
over six decades ago, schools have served over 200 billion lunches that 
have helped generations of children achieve in the classroom and grow 
into our country's next generation of leaders. This school year, the 
program will carry that legacy forward by providing nutritious meals for 
tens of millions of students every day. These meals are a vital source 
of fruits, vegetables, and other fresh and nutritious foods for our 
Nation's young people. Through efforts like First Lady Michelle Obama's 
Let's Move! initiative, we are continuing to bring together stakeholders 
at every level of government, in the private sector, and throughout our 
communities to ensure more children have access to the healthy, 
affordable food they need to learn and grow.
Soon after President Harry Truman signed the National School Lunch Act 
in 1946, he reminded us that ``nothing is more important in our national 
life than the welfare of our children, and proper nourishment comes 
first in attaining this welfare.'' This week, we thank the countless 
individuals who make our children's well-being their highest priority, 
and celebrate the National School Lunch Program as a foundation for 
their success in the years to come.
The Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-
780), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday 
in October each year as ``National School Lunch Week,'' and has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 14 through October 20, 
2012, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join 
the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch 
Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being 
of our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8889 of October 15, 2012

Blind Americans Equality Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As business leaders and public advocates, teachers and scientists, 
musicians and athletes, and in countless other ways, blind and visually 
impaired Americans have profoundly enriched every part of our national 
life. Today, we celebrate their innumerable contributions, and we 
recommit to guaranteeing equal access, equal opportunity, and equal 
respect for all Americans.
My Administration is working to ensure people with disabilities have 
full access to the education, information, and job training they need. 
Over the past year, we have continued to implement the 21st Century 
Communications and Video Accessibility Act, which makes it easier for 
people who are deaf, blind, or visually impaired to take advantage of 
today's cutting-edge technologies--including home and mobile broadband. 
As part of that implementation, the Federal Communications Commission 
has established video description standards for television stations that 
help ensure programming is accessible for blind and visually impaired 
Americans. And in keeping with the promise of equal access to technology 
under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Department of Justice 
reported last month on our progress toward making Federal resources 
fully accessible and offered new recommendations to further improve 
compliance throughout the Federal Government.
We are also striving to open new pathways for blind and visually 
impaired Americans to pursue careers in all fields, including science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). To provide more 
opportunities for students to achieve in math and science classes, the 
Department of Education is promoting effective learning materials for 
blind and visually impaired students. This year, the White House honored 
14 individuals, including several who are blind, as Champions of Change 
for their work to expand educational and employment opportunities for 
people with disabilities in STEM fields. Their example affirms that when 
the playing field is level, people with disabilities are equally capable 
of excelling in these economically vital professions.
When the American people have the chance to succeed, we can achieve 
extraordinary things. Today, we renew our commitment to innovative 
projects and initiatives that will propel us further toward full access, 
inclusion, and opportunity for blind and visually impaired Americans.
By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628, as 
amended), the Congress designated October 15 of each year as ``White 
Cane Safety Day'' to recognize the contributions of Americans who are 
blind or have low vision. Today, let us recommit to strengthening our 
Union and ensuring we remain a Nation where all our people, including 
those living with disabilities, have every opportunity to achieve their 
dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2012, as

[[Page 161]]

Blind Americans Equality Day. I call upon public officials, business and 
community leaders, educators, librarians, and Americans across the 
country to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Death of Arlen Specter

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a mark of respect for the memory of Arlen Specter, I hereby order, by 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States of America, that on the day of his interment, the flag of the 
United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon 
all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval 
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the 
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its 
Territories and possessions until sunset on such day. I also direct that 
the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United 
States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities 
abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and 
stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8891 of October 19, 2012

National Character Counts Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

With every step in our journey toward a more perfect Union, Americans 
have drawn strength from the values that bind us together as one people. 
Personal integrity, mutual respect, commitment to service--these 
timeless ideals have guided our Nation's progress for centuries, 
inspiring us not only to see the best in each other, but also to seek 
the best in ourselves. During National Character Counts Week, we 
celebrate the principles that

[[Page 162]]

keep our country moving forward and renew our commitment to sharing them 
with our sons and daughters.
As parents, teachers, mentors, and neighbors, it is up to all of us to 
empower our children with a sense of excellence in everything they do--
from the classroom through careers and community involvement. We must 
instill in them the creativity and imagination it takes to envision a 
dream, and the drive and discipline it takes to realize one. We should 
also underscore the values of responsibility and service that have 
sustained our national life for generations. With these qualities, all 
of us can seek out new horizons and opportunities with confidence, 
secure in the knowledge that we can overcome the challenges and setbacks 
that confront us.
To ensure that each and every American has the chance to fulfill their 
promise, we must also teach our children to practice kindness and 
respect. Many students across our country have experienced bullying and 
harassment at school, online, or in their communities, eroding their 
ability to thrive and feel that they belong. This week, let us reaffirm 
our responsibility to make our schools and communities safe places that 
nurture not only our students' talents and intelligence, but also their 
sense of empathy and regard for one another.
During National Character Counts Week, we reflect on the principles that 
give us strength to reach for our own dreams and vision to boost others 
toward theirs. As we mark this important occasion, let us rededicate 
ourselves to preserving and passing on those basic American values in 
the years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 21 through 
October 27, 2012, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public 
officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8892 of October 19, 2012

National Forest Products Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's founding, America's forests have played an essential 
role in powering our progress. These rich spaces have provided clean air 
and water for our communities, building materials for our homes, 
reliable growth for our economy, and vibrant environments for us to 
explore. During National Forest Products Week, we celebrate sustainable 
uses of the lands we share and recommit to protecting them for 
generations to come.

[[Page 163]]

Our forests are an essential part of an economy built to last. Woodlands 
encourage tourism and recreation that create jobs and growth in our 
rural communities. They provide the raw materials for products we use 
every day, and they help produce clean, renewable bioenergy that puts us 
on the path toward a secure energy future. Meeting the economic, 
environmental, and energy challenges we face will require active forest 
management that promotes conservation and encourages landowners to keep 
their lands forested. Through my Administration's work to increase 
timber production and forest restoration, as well as efforts like the 
America's Great Outdoors Initiative, we continue to engage partners in 
government, the private sector, and communities nationwide in 
implementing a robust strategy to protect our forests and boost job 
creation.
America's expansive landscapes have contributed immensely to making our 
Nation what it is today, and they remain vital to our progress in the 
years ahead. This week, let us rededicate ourselves to managing our 
forests responsibly, encouraging sustainable forest use, and passing on 
a safer, healthier environment for the next generation.
To recognize the importance of products from our forests, the Congress, 
by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the 
week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as ``National 
Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 21 through October 27, 2012, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call on the people of the United States 
to join me in recognizing the dedicated individuals who are responsible 
for the stewardship of our forests and for the preservation, management, 
and use of these precious natural resources for the benefit of the 
American people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8893 of October 24, 2012

United Nations Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty-seven years ago, as the world began to emerge from the shadows of 
war, the 51 founding member states of the United Nations came together 
to take up the new test of forging a lasting peace. In a decade scarred 
by genocide, the United Nations chose the hope of unity over the ease of 
division, boldly promising to future generations that the dignity and 
equality of human beings would be our common cause. Today, we 
commemorate United Nations Day by celebrating the founding ideals laid 
down in its

[[Page 164]]

Charter and reaffirming the commitments to peace building, human rights, 
and social progress that will guide us in the years to come.
Throughout its history, the United Nations Charter has reflected the 
belief that the world is more secure when the global community acts 
collectively. Dedicated to assuring ``the equal rights of men and women 
and of nations large and small,'' the institution has played an 
essential role in addressing the conditions that make the world more 
just and conflict less likely--caring for children, tending to the sick, 
and pursuing peace in places wracked by conflict. In today's world, this 
mission remains as vital as it has ever been. Across the globe, people 
are making their voices heard. They are insisting on their innate 
dignity and the right to determine their future. The United States will 
always stand up for these aspirations at home and abroad, and we will 
join our global partners in working to realize them.
Through the better part of a century, we have seen what is possible when 
a strong and united international community takes action to advance the 
interests and values we share. The founding values of the United Nations 
remind us that countries can resolve their differences peacefully, and 
that all people deserve the chance to seek their own destiny, free from 
fear and empowered with their most fundamental rights. As we recognize 
this 67th anniversary of the United Nations, let us recommit to carrying 
that vision forward in the years ahead.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2012, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, and the 
officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to 
observe United Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8894 of October 29, 2012

To Implement the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement and for 
Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On June 28, 2007, the United States entered into the United States-
Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (the ``Agreement''). The Congress 
approved the Agreement in section 101(a) of the United States-Panama 
Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the ``Implementation 
Act'') (Public Law 112-43, 125 Stat. 497).
2. Section 105(a) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office that 
shall

[[Page 165]]

be responsible for providing administrative assistance to panels 
established under chapter 20 of the Agreement.
3. Section 201 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such 
continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional 
duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to 
carry out or apply Articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.27, 3.28, and 3.29 and 
Annex 3.3 of the Agreement.
4. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Implementation Act, Panama 
is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary 
developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP).
5. Consistent with section 201(a)(3) of the Implementation Act, Panama 
is removed from the enumeration of beneficiary countries under the 
Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.), 
subject to the exceptions set out in section 201(a)(3)(B) of the 
Implementation Act.
6. Consistent with section 213(b)(5)(D) of the CBERA, as amended by the 
Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) (Public Law 106-200), 
Panama is removed from the enumeration of designated CBTPA beneficiary 
countries.
7. Consistent with section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2483), I have determined that other technical 
and conforming changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) are necessary to reflect that Panama is no longer eligible 
to receive the benefits of the GSP, the CBERA, and the CBTPA.
8. Section 201(d) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
take such action as may be necessary in implementing the tariff-rate 
quotas set forth in Appendix I to the General Notes to the Schedule of 
the United States to Annex 3.3 of the Agreement to ensure that imports 
of agricultural goods do not disrupt the orderly marketing of 
commodities in the United States.
9. Section 203 of the Implementation Act sets forth certain rules for 
determining whether a good is an originating good for the purpose of 
implementing preferential tariff treatment provided for under the 
Agreement. I have determined that it is necessary to include these rules 
of origin, together with particular rules applicable to certain other 
goods, in the HTS.
10. Section 203(o)(4) of the Implementation Act authorizes the 
President, after receiving a request from an interested entity, to 
determine that a fabric, yarn, or fiber is or is not available in 
commercial quantities in a timely manner in Panama and the United 
States; to establish procedures governing the submission of a request 
for any such determination and ensuring appropriate public participation 
in any such determination; to add to the list of the United States as 
set forth in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement any fabric, yarn, or fiber 
determined to be not available in commercial quantities in a timely 
manner in Panama and the United States; or to remove from the list in 
Annex 3.25 of the Agreement any fabric, yarn, or fiber that the 
President has previously added to that list.

[[Page 166]]

11. Section 208 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to 
take certain enforcement actions relating to trade with Panama in 
textile and apparel goods.
12. Subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act authorizes the 
President to take certain actions in response to a request by an 
interested party for relief from serious damage or actual threat thereof 
to a domestic industry producing certain textile or apparel articles.
13. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established the 
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), 
consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, 
Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as 
Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. 
Consistent with section 301 of title 3, United States Code, when 
carrying out functions vested in the President by statute and assigned 
by the President to CITA, the officials collectively exercising those 
functions are all to be officers required to be appointed by the 
President with the advice and consent of the Senate.
14. Section 202(o)(2)(B)(ii) of the United States-Korea Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act authorizes the President, subject to the 
consultation and layover provisions of section 104, to proclaim before 
the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the United 
States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (the ``Korea FTA'') enters into force, 
modifications to the HTS to correct any typographical, clerical, or non-
substantive technical error regarding the provisions of chapters 50 
through 63 (as included in Annex 4-A of the Korea FTA). The Korea FTA 
entered into force on March 15, 2012.
15. A provision in chapter 61 (as included in Annex 4-A of the Korea 
FTA) contained a clerical error that the United States and Korea have 
agreed to correct. I have determined that a modification to the HTS is 
necessary to correct this error and to provide the intended tariff 
treatment. The requirements of the consultation and layover provisions 
for the proposed correction of this error were completed on August 17, 
2012.
16. Presidential Proclamation 8341 of January 16, 2009, implemented the 
U.S. tariff commitments under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion 
Agreement and incorporated by reference Publication 4058 of the U.S. 
International Trade Commission (the ``Commission''), entitled 
``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
to Implement the United States-Peru Free Trade Agreement.'' Annex I of 
Publication 4058 included a technical error that affected the tariff 
treatment of a good of Peru and omitted cross-references for certain 
tariff lines. I have determined that modifications to the HTS are 
necessary to correct this error and omission.
17. Presidential Proclamation 8783 of March 6, 2012, implemented U.S. 
tariff commitments under the Korea FTA and incorporated by reference 
Publication 4308 of the Commission, entitled ``Modifications to the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the United 
States-Korea Free Trade Agreement.'' Annexes I and II to that 
publication each included a technical error that affected the tariff 
treatment accorded to certain goods of Korea. I have determined that a 
modification to the HTS is necessary to correct these errors.

[[Page 167]]

18. Presidential Proclamation 8818 of May 14, 2012, implemented U.S. 
tariff commitments under the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion 
Agreement and incorporated by reference Publication 4320 of the 
Commission, entitled ``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
of the United States to Implement the United States-Colombia Trade 
Promotion Agreement.'' Annexes I and II to that publication included 
technical errors that affected the tariff treatment accorded to certain 
goods of Colombia and omitted cross-references for certain tariff lines. 
I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct 
the technical errors and omissions.
19. Section 604 of the 1974 Act authorizes the President to embody in 
the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of chapter V of that Act, 
and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken 
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 604 of the 1974 Act, sections 105(a), 201, 203, and 208, and 
subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act, and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code, and having made the determination under 
section 101(b) of the Implementation Act necessary for the exchange of 
notes, do hereby proclaim:

treatment being accorded under the Agreement, to set forth rules for 
determining whether goods imported into the customs territory of the

Panama for the purposes of the Agreement, and to reflect Panama's 
removal from the list of beneficiary developing countries under the GSP, 
and from the list of beneficiary countries under CBERA and CBTPA, the 
HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I of Publication 4349 of the 
Commission, entitled ``Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
of the United States to Implement the United States-Panama Trade 
Promotion Agreement,'' which is incorporated by reference into this

sections of such Annex and on any subsequent dates set forth for such 
duty reductions in that Annex.

    (5) The CITA is authorized to exercise the authority of the 
President under section 203(o)(4) of the Implementation Act to determine

and ensuring appropriate public participation in any such determination; 
to add any fabric, yarn, or fiber determined to be not available in 
commercial quantities in a timely manner in Panama and the United States 
to the list in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement; or to remove from the list 
in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement any fabric, yarn, or fiber that the 
President has previously added to that list.
    (6) The CITA is authorized to exercise the authority of the 
President under section 208 of the Implementation Act to direct the 
exclusion of certain textile and apparel goods from the customs 
territory of the United States and to direct the denial of preferential 
tariff treatment to textile and apparel goods.
    (7) The CITA is authorized to exercise the functions of the 
President under subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act to 
review requests, and to determine whether to commence consideration of 
such requests; after an appropriate determination, to cause to be 
published in the Federal Register a notice of commencement of 
consideration of a request and notice seeking public comment; to 
determine whether imports of a Panamanian textile or apparel article are 
causing serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry 
producing an article that is like, or directly competitive with, the 
imported article; and to provide relief from imports of an article that 
is the subject of an affirmative determination as to damage or threat.
    (8) The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is authorized to 
fulfill the obligations of the President under section 104 of the

those congressional committees regarding the proposed action.
    (9) The USTR is authorized to modify U.S. note 4 to subchapter XX of

reflect modifications pursuant to paragraph (7) of this proclamation by 
the CITA to the list of fabrics, yarns, or fibers in Annex 3.25 of the

of Peru entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after February 1, 2009.
    (14) In order to provide the intended tariff treatment to certain

Proclamation 8895 of November 1, 2012

Military Family Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's earliest days, courageous men and women of all 
backgrounds and beliefs have banded together to fight for the freedoms 
we cherish. Behind each of them stands a parent, a sibling, a child, a 
spouse--proud family members who share the weight of deployment and make 
profound sacrifices on behalf of our country. During Military Family 
Month, we honor our military families and recommit to showing them the 
fullest care and respect of a grateful Nation.
In our military families, we see the best our country has to offer. They 
demonstrate the virtues that have made America great for more than two 
centuries and the values that will preserve our greatness for centuries 
to come. With loved ones serving far from home, military spouses take on 
the work of two. Their children show courage and resilience as they move 
from base to base, school to school, home to home. And even through the 
strain of deployment, military families strengthen the fabric of each 
community they touch and enrich our national life as shining examples of 
patriotism.
We each have a solemn duty to serve our Armed Forces and their families 
as well as they serve us. Through First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill 
Biden's Joining Forces initiative, we have worked to fulfill this 
obligation by mobilizing all Americans to give service members and their 
families the opportunities and support they have earned. Last year, we 
challenged American businesses to hire or train 100,000 veterans and 
military spouses

[[Page 170]]

by the end of 2013. To date, they have already exceeded that challenge, 
hiring over 125,000 veterans and military spouses. From helping military 
children succeed in the classroom to increasing support for those who 
care for our wounded warriors, Joining Forces will keep fighting to 
ensure the well-being of our troops and their families.
When a young woman signs up to defend our Nation, her parents are 
enlisted as well. When a father deploys to a combat zone, his children 
are called to serve on the home front. And when the men and women of our 
military serve far from home, their families feel the strain of their 
absence. In that absence, let us stand together as one American family. 
Let us honor the brave patriots who keep our country safe, and let us 
forever hold close the memories of those who have perished in the line 
of duty. This month, we reaffirm that we will always lift up our 
military families--not just when their loved ones are away, but also 
long after the welcome home ceremonies are over.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2012 as 
Military Family Month. I call on all Americans to honor military 
families through private actions and public service for the tremendous 
contributions they make in support of our service members and our 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8896 of November 1, 2012

National Adoption Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation that believes all children deserve the chance to reach their 
full potential, we have a fundamental responsibility to ensure each of 
them grows up knowing the love and protection of a permanent family. 
During National Adoption Month, we give voice to children who are still 
waiting for that opportunity, celebrate the bond that unites adoptive 
parents with their sons and daughters, and recommit to providing every 
child with the care and security that will nurture their development and 
well-being.
Later this month, many Americans will also mark National Adoption Day by 
completing a foster care adoption and embracing a new member of their 
family. Driven by reasons unique to their households but united by the 
spirit of compassion that moves all who choose to adopt, these parents 
will take up our country's most important task--the work of raising our 
sons and daughters. As we celebrate the contributions of adoptive 
parents across our Nation, let us also strive to eliminate 
discriminatory barriers that would separate foster children from a 
loving family. Adoptive families

[[Page 171]]

come in many forms, and it is essential that all qualified adults have 
the opportunity to care for a child in need.
My Administration remains committed to helping every child find a loving 
home. We have partnered with faith-based and community organizations 
across America to help connect children with adoptive parents, and we 
continue to work with State, local, and tribal governments to improve 
child outcomes; enhance safety, permanency, and well-being; and support 
adoptive families. I was proud to sign the Affordable Care Act and the 
International Adoption Simplification Act, which have made it easier for 
families to adopt, as well as the Child and Family Services Improvement 
and Innovation Act, which will help reduce the length of time young 
children are without families. We have built on those efforts as part of 
the National Adoption Campaign, which continues to bring adoption and 
foster care into our national conversation.
Thousands of children living in America hope for the comfort and safety 
of a loving family. This month, we pay tribute to the dedicated 
professionals who help make those children's dreams a reality, sharpen 
our resolve to find a permanent home for every child, and celebrate the 
stories of all whose lives have been touched by adoption.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2012 as 
National Adoption Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month 
by answering the call to find a permanent and caring family for every 
child in need, and by supporting the families who care for them.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8897 of November 1, 2012

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, families across our country confront the tragic realities of 
Alzheimer's disease--an irreversible, fatal illness that robs men and 
women of their cherished memories and leads to progressive mental and 
physical impairments. Millions of individuals suffer from this 
debilitating ailment, and millions more shoulder profound emotional and 
financial burdens by serving as caregivers for their loved ones. As the 
number of older Americans grows in the coming years, Alzheimer's disease 
will continue to pose serious risks to our well-being--which is why it 
is essential we join together to address it today. During National 
Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we stand with all those who have 
known the pain of this devastating illness, extend our support to 
Americans living with Alzheimer's, and press on toward promising new 
treatments.

[[Page 172]]

This May, my Administration released the first National Plan to Address 
Alzheimer's Disease. The Plan lays out a bold vision for Alzheimer's 
prevention and treatment, calling for a comprehensive, collaborative 
approach that engages partners throughout the public, private, and non-
profit sectors. As part of this effort, we have made historic 
investments in research and clinical trials that bring us closer to 
unlocking tomorrow's therapies. Through www.Alzheimers.gov, we are 
working to empower people living with Alzheimer's, their caregivers, and 
all Americans with information and resources about the disease. We are 
also providing training to health care providers to help them recognize 
the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and care for those who 
suffer from it. And to help ensure Americans living with Alzheimer's can 
access the care they need, we have worked to strengthen Medicare and 
expand choices for health insurance.
In homes and care facilities across our country, Alzheimer's disease 
continues to take a heartbreaking toll on millions of lives. As we honor 
the memory of those we have lost and lend our strength to those who face 
this ailment today, let us strive toward a brighter future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2012 as 
National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of 
the United States to learn more about Alzheimer's disease and to offer 
their support to the individuals living with this disease and to their 
caregivers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8898 of November 1, 2012

National Diabetes Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening illness that touches Americans 
of every age, ethnicity, and background. Its complications can be far-
reaching: diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and new cases 
of blindness, and people living with the disease are at higher risk of 
high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Our efforts to promote 
greater awareness and pioneering research continue to drive our work 
toward lessening its impact on our country. This month, we rededicate 
ourselves to that vital task and commend the dedicated professionals who 
are leading the charge against diabetes.
Today, over 20 million Americans suffer from diabetes, and public health 
officials estimate that more than 1 million new cases will be diagnosed 
this year. Of those, some will be Type 1 diabetes, which often develops 
during

[[Page 173]]

childhood. While the risk factors for Type 1 diabetes are not fully 
understood, insulin injections, regular exercise, and a healthy diet can 
help manage the disease. In adults, the majority of new cases will be 
Type 2 diabetes--an illness associated with obesity, physical 
inactivity, family history of diabetes, and older age. Some racial and 
ethnic groups are at higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. This 
form of the disease has also become more prevalent among youth. While 
Type 2 diabetes can be treated through diet and medication, research 
shows that it can also be prevented or delayed with changes in 
lifestyle. I encourage all Americans to learn more about diabetes at 
www.NDEP.NIH.gov, and to talk to their health care provider about what 
they can do to reduce their risk of developing this serious disease.
As long as diabetes continues to burden our communities, we must press 
on toward tomorrow's promising breakthroughs in prevention, treatment, 
and care. My Administration is proud to help advance this cause through 
the National Diabetes Prevention Program, which was included in the 
Affordable Care Act. This program joins private and public partners 
together in encouraging lifestyle changes that can prevent or delay the 
onset of Type 2 diabetes among those who are at high risk. The 
Affordable Care Act also ensures that, in many health plans, Americans 
at higher risk for developing diabetes can receive diabetes screening 
with no out-of-pocket costs. We have worked to equip Americans with the 
facts about diabetes through the National Diabetes Education Program, 
which promotes early diagnosis and effective diabetes management. To 
address the rise in childhood obesity that puts our young people at 
greater risk of developing diabetes, heart disease, and cancer during 
adulthood, First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative has 
focused on giving children and parents the tools they need to make 
healthy choices and put their kids on the path to a bright future.
With dedication, persistence, and ingenuity, we can put an end to the 
diabetes epidemic. In memory of those we have lost, and in solidarity 
with all who have felt the impact of this disease, let us keep fighting 
to secure better outcomes for Americans living with diabetes, fuller 
understanding of how we can prevent new cases, and greater wellness for 
every man, woman, and child.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2012 as 
National Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans, school systems, 
government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health care providers, 
research institutions, and other interested groups to join in activities 
that raise diabetes awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage the 
disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8899 of November 1, 2012

National Entrepreneurship Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America is known around the world as a country that empowers the 
inventor and the innovator. Ours is a Nation where men and women can 
take a chance on a dream--where they can take an idea that starts around 
a kitchen table or in a garage and turn it into a new business or a new 
industry. During National Entrepreneurship Month, we celebrate the hard 
work, ingenuity, and courage of our thinkers, doers, and makers.
Because the new businesses created by entrepreneurs are responsible for 
most of the new jobs in our country, helping them succeed is essential 
to helping our economy grow. That is why my Administration has fought 
tirelessly to invest in entrepreneurs and small businesses so they can 
do what they do best--take risks, develop new ideas, grow businesses, 
and create new jobs. To help them expand and hire, I have signed 18 tax 
cuts for small businesses into law. Last year, my Administration 
launched the Startup America initiative to help connect innovators to 
funding and mentorship, cut through red tape, speed up innovation, and 
get their ventures off the ground faster. Alongside it, leaders in the 
private sector launched the Startup America Partnership, which has made 
over $1 billion in business services available to a national network 
that will serve tens of thousands of startups over the next 3 years. I 
also directed Federal agencies to streamline processes for establishing 
public-private research partnerships, small business research and 
development grants, and university-startup collaborations. And we 
launched BusinessUSA, a virtual one-stop shop that helps businesses--
large and small--access the full range of Federal resources they need at 
every stage of their development.
My Administration has continued to build on that progress in 2012. 
Earlier this year, I signed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) 
Act into law, which is making it easier for innovative companies to go 
public and expand their workforce. For the first time, the law will also 
allow ordinary Americans to go online and invest in the startups and 
small businesses they believe in through crowdfunding platforms. We have 
also updated regulations to make it easier for foundations to invest in 
businesses pursuing charitable purposes and stronger communities. In 
August, we launched the Presidential Innovation Fellows program to bring 
top innovators outside of Government together with top innovators inside 
Government; release Federal data that is being used to develop new 
products, services, and businesses; make it easier for startup 
entrepreneurs to compete for Government contracts; transform the way 
citizens access Government information and services; and save taxpayers 
money. In addition, thousands of American entrepreneurs and inventors 
are helping Federal agencies solve tough problems at www.Challenge.gov. 
And, as part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act I 
signed in February, we have bolstered Self-Employment Assistance 
programs that allow States to empower unemployed workers to start their 
own businesses.
As long as America's daring entrepreneurs are taking risks and putting 
themselves behind new ideas and innovations, the Federal Government

[[Page 175]]

will serve as a partner to support their endeavors and catalyze their 
success. This month, and during Global Entrepreneurship Week, let us 
renew the spirit of innovation that has fueled more than two centuries 
of American progress and promises to drive us in the years to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2012 as 
National Entrepreneurship Month. I call upon all Americans to 
commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities, and to 
celebrate November 16, 2012, as National Entrepreneurs' Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8900 of November 1, 2012

National Family Caregivers Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation's health care professionals provide essential medical 
services to millions of Americans, yet they do not shoulder their 
responsibilities alone. Family members, friends, and neighbors devote 
countless hours to providing care to their relatives or loved ones. 
During National Family Caregivers Month, we recognize and thank the 
humble heroes who do so much to keep our families and communities 
strong.
Across America, daughters and sons balance the work of caring for aging 
parents with the demands of their careers and raising their own 
children. Spouses and partners become caregivers to the ones they love 
even as they navigate their own health challenges. Mothers and fathers 
resume care for children returning home as wounded warriors. Friends and 
relatives form networks to support loved ones with disabilities. All of 
them give selflessly to bring comfort, social engagement, and stability 
to those they love.
Family caregivers have an immeasurable impact on the lives of those they 
assist, but their hours are long and their work is hard. Many put their 
own lives on hold to lift up someone close to them. That is why my 
Administration continues to support these committed individuals through 
programs like the National Family Caregiver Support Program and the 
Lifespan Respite Care Program, and through new initiatives like the 
National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. These efforts help 
caregivers access services, provide quality support, and reinforce their 
support through respite care options. Additionally, my Administration 
has pursued workplace flexibility initiatives that help caregivers 
balance their responsibilities to their employers with their 
responsibilities to their loved ones. I was also proud to sign the 
Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act, which has helped 
our most seriously injured post-9/11 veterans and their family 
caregivers through financial support; access to health insurance, mental 
health

[[Page 176]]

services, and counseling; and comprehensive caregiver training and 
respite care.
National Family Caregivers Month is a time to reflect on the compassion 
and dedication that family caregivers embody every day. As we offer our 
appreciation and admiration for their difficult work, let us also extend 
our own offers of support to them and their loved ones.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2012 as 
National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to pay 
tribute to those who provide for the health and well-being of their 
family members, friends, and neighbors.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8901 of November 1, 2012

National Native American Heritage Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As the first people to live on the land we all cherish, American Indians 
and Alaska Natives have profoundly shaped our country's character and 
our cultural heritage. Today, Native Americans are leaders in every 
aspect of our society--from the classroom, to the boardroom, to the 
battlefield. This month, we celebrate and honor the many ways American 
Indians and Alaska Natives have enriched our Nation, and we renew our 
commitment to respecting each tribe's identity while ensuring equal 
opportunity to pursue the American dream.
In paying tribute to Native American achievements, we must also 
acknowledge the parts of our shared history that have been marred by 
violence and tragic mistreatment. For centuries, Native Americans faced 
cruelty, injustice, and broken promises. As we work together to forge a 
brighter future, we cannot shy away from the difficult aspects of our 
past. That is why, in 2009, I signed a bipartisan resolution that 
finally recognized the sad and painful chapters in our shared history. 
My Administration remains dedicated to writing a new chapter in that 
history by strengthening our government-to-government relationship with 
tribal nations while enhancing tribal sovereignty and tribal self-
determination.
Because we know that the best ideas for tribal nations come from within, 
my Administration has continued to engage tribal leaders in developing 
an agenda that respects their expertise on matters affecting American 
Indians and Alaska Natives. In collaboration with tribal nations, we are 
making critical investments to improve health and education services, 
create jobs, and strengthen tribal economies. In July, I was proud to 
sign the Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership 
(HEARTH) Act

[[Page 177]]

into law, which will enhance tribal control over the leasing of Indian 
lands. Last December, I signed an Executive Order to expand educational 
opportunities for Native American students. It aims to preserve Native 
languages, cultures, and histories while offering a competitive 
education that prepares young people to succeed in college and careers. 
And under the Tribal Law and Order Act and the Safe Indian Communities 
initiative, we are continuing to work with tribes to build safer 
communities. My Administration also supports the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Many longstanding Native American legal claims against the United States 
have been resolved, which will help accelerate the restoration of trust 
in our relationships with tribal nations. The settlements that came out 
of these claims--including the historic Cobell and Keepseagle 
settlements, as well as more than 50 settlements in cases alleging 
Federal mismanagement of tribal trust funds and resources--will put an 
end to decades of litigation and help drive economic development in 
tribal communities in the years to come.
In partnership with tribal nations, my Administration has addressed 
injustices and built new avenues of opportunity for American Indians and 
Alaska Natives. As we celebrate National Native American Heritage Month, 
let us move forward in the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual 
trust, confident that our challenges can be met and that our shared 
future is bright.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2012 as 
National Native American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to 
commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities, and to 
celebrate November 23, 2012, as Native American Heritage Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8902 of November 7, 2012

Veterans Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Whether they fought in Salerno or Samarra, Heartbreak Ridge or Helmand, 
Khe Sanh or the Korengal, our veterans are part of an unbroken chain of 
men and women who have served our country with honor and distinction. On 
Veterans Day, we show them our deepest thanks. Their sacrifices have 
helped secure more than two centuries of American progress, and their 
legacy affirms that no matter what confronts us or what trials we face, 
there is no challenge we cannot overcome, and our best days are still 
ahead.

[[Page 178]]

This year, we marked the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. We began 
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War. We welcomed our 
veterans back home from Iraq, and we continued to wind down operations 
in Afghanistan. These milestones remind us that, though much has changed 
since Americans first took up arms to advance freedom's cause, the 
spirit that moved our forebears is the same spirit that has defined each 
generation of our service members. Our men and women in uniform have 
taught us about strength, duty, devotion, resolve--cornerstones of a 
commitment to protect and defend that has kept our country safe for over 
200 years. In war and in peace, their service has been selfless and 
their accomplishments have been extraordinary.
Even after our veterans take off the uniform, they never stop serving. 
Many apply the skills and experience they developed on the battlefield 
to a life of service here at home. They take on roles in their 
communities as doctors and police officers, engineers and entrepreneurs, 
mothers and fathers. As a grateful Nation, it is our task to make that 
transition possible--to ensure our returning heroes can share in the 
opportunities they have given so much to defend. The freedoms we cherish 
endure because of their service and sacrifice, and our country must 
strive to honor our veterans by fulfilling our responsibilities to them 
and upholding the sacred trust we share with all who have served.
On days like this, we are called to reflect on immeasurable burdens that 
have been borne by so few. We pay tribute to our wounded, our missing, 
our fallen, and their families--men and women who have known the true 
costs of conflict and deserve our deepest respect, now and forever. We 
also remember that our commitments to those who have served are 
commitments we must honor not only on Veterans Day, but every day. As we 
do so, let us reaffirm our promise that when our troops finish their 
tours of duty, they come home to an America that gives them the benefits 
they have earned, the care they deserve, and the fullest opportunity to 
keep their families strong and our country moving forward.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service 
members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's 
veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2012, as Veterans Day. I 
encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our 
veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers. I 
call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the 
United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their 
communities. I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal 
organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities to support 
this day with commemorative expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8903 of November 9, 2012

World Freedom Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary 
citizens spark movements for change because they speak to a longing for 
freedom that has been building up for years. So it was in Berlin on 
November 9, 1989, when the German people began tearing down a wall that 
divided them from their loved ones and symbolized a system that denied 
them universal human rights. In the face of tyranny, many individuals 
spoke with one voice. They insisted the world could change--and knowing 
that destiny is what human beings make of it, they courageously realized 
the change they sought.
Today, we commemorate the collapse of the Iron Curtain and celebrate the 
freedom that grew in its place. We also remember that for many, the 
walls of oppression still stand, and the human rights we honor today are 
still beyond reach. People around the world continue to demand 
fundamental liberties they are denied--freedom to express themselves, 
live their faith, assemble without fear, and choose their leaders freely 
and fairly. The United States was founded on the belief that people 
should govern themselves, and as keepers of that proud history, we must 
stand with those who are reaching for their rights, knowing their 
success will bring about a world that is more peaceful, more stable, and 
more just.
As we pursue those goals with renewed vigor, the lessons of the 20th 
century will continue to remind us what is possible in the 21st. Let us 
never forget what happened in Berlin 23 years ago, nor the sacrifices 
that made it possible. And together, let us keep the light of freedom 
burning bright for all who live in the shadow of oppression and dream of 
a better future for themselves and their children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2012, as 
World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming 
our dedication to freedom and democracy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8904 of November 9, 2012

American Education Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

All children deserve access to a world-class education and the chance to 
pursue their dreams. Our schools are a gateway to those opportunities 
and the key to our Nation's economic prosperity and civic life. This 
week, we reaffirm our national mission of educating our students and 
training our workers better than any other country on earth.
My Administration is committed to enhancing American education by 
raising standards, making higher education more affordable, and 
preparing students for high-skill jobs and civic participation. We 
launched Race to the Top--the most meaningful reform for our public 
schools in a generation--to invest in innovative State plans that 
support and improve teacher effectiveness and student achievement. We 
reconfigured the student loan program to eliminate wasteful subsidies to 
banks and put students' needs first, increasing financial aid for 
millions of young people. We also invested in training programs that 
partner community colleges with high-growth industries--making it 
possible for young Americans to graduate into the workforce equipped for 
success.
Each of us has a role to play in helping our students thrive. Dedicated 
teachers, administrators, and other education professionals work 
tirelessly on behalf of America's young people. Outside of the 
classroom, parents, mentors, community leaders, local businesses, and 
public institutions help foster a love of learning in our students, 
sparking creativity, instilling a positive work ethic, and giving our 
children the tools needed to realize their full potential.
America is a country where no matter what you look like or where you 
come from, if you are willing to work hard, you can go as far as your 
talents will take you. During American Education Week, we recommit to 
keeping the promise of education alive for this generation and the next, 
because when we give our children the best chance to succeed, there is 
no telling what they might accomplish.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 11 to 
November 17, 2012, as American Education Week. I call upon all Americans 
to observe this week by supporting their local schools through 
appropriate activities, events, and programs designed to help create 
opportunities for every school and student in America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8905 of November 15, 2012

America Recycles Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For 15 years, our country has celebrated America Recycles Day as a time 
to focus on conserving valuable materials, keeping our communities 
clean, and protecting our environment. Today, we reflect on the progress 
we have made toward fulfilling those important goals and rededicate 
ourselves to building a more sustainable future.
Each year, recycling puts millions of pounds of valuable materials back 
into use. By diverting old products from the landfill to the factory 
floor, we take meaningful steps toward a greener economy and help power 
an entire industry centered on recycling, reuse, and refurbishing. We 
also reduce or avoid the environmental impacts of using virgin 
materials.
As many of us prepare to gather with families and friends this 
Thanksgiving, America Recycles Day offers a chance to highlight another 
resource that is too often taken for granted: food. Though many 
Americans lack access to regular, nutritious meals, much of our 
country's food goes to waste. To put surplus food to better use, the 
Environmental Protection Agency is partnering with businesses and 
organizations in the Food Recovery Challenge, which is helping 
participants support their communities through food donation and protect 
their bottom line by reducing waste. By consuming carefully and donating 
what we can, each of us can join in that important work. Food banks and 
pantries accept wholesome food that meets quality and safety standards, 
as do many national and local food recovery programs. Through giving to 
those in need, all Americans can lift up their communities while helping 
protect the environment we share.
Aldo Leopold once said that conservation is ``a positive exercise of 
skill and insight, not merely a negative exercise of abstinence and 
caution.'' With that important lesson in mind, let us commemorate 
America Recycles Day by taking bold action to preserve our natural 
resources, strengthen our economy, and protect the bountiful landscapes 
we have been blessed with.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2012, as 
America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I 
encourage all Americans to continue their reducing, reusing, and 
recycling efforts throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8906 of November 16, 2012

National Family Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The bonds that tie us to our loved ones have always played an important 
role in the American story. Families of every makeup continue to guide 
our country's progress by supporting one another with unshakable 
devotion and instilling strength of character in their children. This 
week, we celebrate the unity and compassion that keep our families 
strong.
Every family deserves the chance to make a better future for themselves 
and their children. That is why strong families will always be at the 
heart of my Administration's agenda--from the classroom to the workplace 
to our military. Over the past 4 years, we have worked to bring a 
complete and competitive education within reach for all our children, 
and we have striven to help them grow up healthy by broadening access to 
nutritious meals. To ensure families have health coverage when they need 
it most, the Affordable Care Act put in place comprehensive reforms that 
will hold insurance companies accountable, improve health care quality, 
and expand access to affordable coverage. My Administration has also 
pursued greater workplace flexibility, so working parents do not face a 
choice between their jobs and meeting their families' needs. Moreover, 
we continue to promote the critical role fathers can play in enhancing 
the intellectual, emotional, and financial well-being of our sons and 
daughters. Finally, at a time when many of our military families are 
stretched thin, we are mobilizing communities and organizations 
nationwide to give our service members and their loved ones the support 
they have earned.
America's prosperity has always come from an economy that is built on a 
strong and growing middle class--families who can own homes, send their 
kids to college, and save enough for retirement. As our economic 
recovery continues, we must keep working to give them the security they 
deserve, and to widen the circle of opportunity for all who are working 
hard to get ahead. During National Family Week, let us recommit to 
keeping America's promise alive for every family.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 18 through 
November 24, 2012, as National Family Week. I invite all States, 
communities, and individuals to join in observing this week with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8907 of November 20, 2012

National Child's Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

All children deserve the chance to follow their passions, chase their 
dreams, and pursue their fullest measure of happiness. On National 
Child's Day, we celebrate the innumerable ways our sons and daughters 
have enriched our lives, and we rededicate ourselves to helping them 
achieve excellence in everything they do.
America's success in the 21st century depends on our ability to give our 
children the best education possible. By providing the critical 
foundation for academic achievement, parents, families, and community 
groups play an essential part in fulfilling that mission. To bolster 
their efforts, my Administration has partnered with States and 
communities across our country to build more pathways to opportunity for 
our students. We launched Race to the Top, a national competition to 
improve our schools that has helped encourage nearly every State to 
raise education standards. We have strengthened early childhood 
education to help prevent achievement gaps before they start. We have 
invested in math and science education, redoubled efforts to turn around 
struggling schools, and expanded financial aid to help make higher 
education something every family can afford. And moving forward, we will 
keep working to ensure all our children have the skills they need to 
achieve their highest ambitions.
In order to thrive in school and grow up strong, our children need a 
healthy start in life that includes nourishing meals and regular 
physical activity. Every day, parents and guardians are taking up that 
important task by making healthy choices for their kids. Schools are 
finding innovative ways to provide nutritious food for their students, 
and communities are coming together to help young people lead healthier 
lives right from the start. As these groups fulfill their 
responsibilities to our children, my Administration is striving to 
fulfill ours through efforts like First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's 
Move! initiative, which aims to solve the problem of childhood obesity 
within a generation, and the Affordable Care Act, which has expanded 
preventive services for children and ensured health coverage for 
millions of young adults.
High-quality education and health care are essential to giving our 
children the future they deserve. As we take this opportunity to honor 
our sons and daughters, let us reaffirm that no matter what challenges 
lie ahead of us, providing the best for our children will always be our 
first priority.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2012, as 
National Child's Day. I call upon all citizens to observe this day with 
appropriate activities, programs, and ceremonies, and to rededicate 
ourselves to creating the bright future we want for our Nation's 
children.

Proclamation 8908 of November 20, 2012

Thanksgiving Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Thanksgiving Day, Americans everywhere gather with family and friends 
to recount the joys and blessings of the past year. This day is a time 
to take stock of the fortune we have known and the kindnesses we have 
shared, grateful for the God-given bounty that enriches our lives. As 
many pause to lend a hand to those in need, we are also reminded of the 
indelible spirit of compassion and mutual responsibility that has 
distinguished our Nation since its earliest days.
Many Thanksgivings have offered opportunities to celebrate community 
during times of hardship. When the Pilgrims at Plymouth Colony gave 
thanks for a bountiful harvest nearly four centuries ago, they enjoyed 
the fruits of their labor with the Wampanoag tribe--a people who had 
shared vital knowledge of the land in the difficult months before. When 
President George Washington marked our democracy's first Thanksgiving, 
he prayed to our Creator for peace, union, and plenty through the trials 
that would surely come. And when our Nation was torn by bitterness and 
civil war, President Abraham Lincoln reminded us that we were, at heart, 
one Nation, sharing a bond as Americans that could bend but would not 
break. Those expressions of unity still echo today, whether in the 
contributions that generations of Native Americans have made to our 
country, the Union our forebears fought so hard to preserve, or the 
providence that draws our families together this season.
As we reflect on our proud heritage, let us also give thanks to those 
who honor it by giving back. This Thanksgiving, thousands of our men and 
women in uniform will sit down for a meal far from their loved ones and 
the comforts of home. We honor their service and sacrifice. We also show 
our appreciation to Americans who are serving in their communities, 
ensuring their neighbors have a hot meal and a place to stay. Their 
actions reflect our age-old belief that we are our brothers' and 
sisters' keepers, and they affirm once more that we are a people who 
draw our deepest strength not from might or wealth, but from our bonds 
to each other.
On Thanksgiving Day, individuals from all walks of life come together to 
celebrate this most American tradition, grateful for the blessings of 
family, community, and country. Let us spend this day by lifting up 
those we love, mindful of the grace bestowed upon us by God and by all 
who have made our lives richer with their presence.

[[Page 185]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 22, 
2012, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage the people of the 
United States to join together--whether in our homes, places of worship, 
community centers, or any place of fellowship for friends and 
neighbors--and give thanks for all we have received in the past year, 
express appreciation to those whose lives enrich our own, and share our 
bounty with others.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of

Proclamation 8909 of November 29, 2012

World AIDS Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On World AIDS Day, more than 30 years after the first cases of this 
tragic illness were reported, we join the global community once more in 
standing with the millions of people who live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. 
We also recommit to preventing the spread of this disease, fighting the 
stigma associated with infection, and ending this pandemic once and for 
all.
In 2010, my Administration released the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, our 
Nation's first comprehensive plan to fight the domestic epidemic. The 
Strategy aims to reduce new infections, increase access to care, reduce 
health disparities, and achieve a more coordinated national response to 
HIV/AIDS here in the United States. To meet these goals, we are 
advancing HIV/AIDS education; connecting stakeholders throughout the 
public, private, and non-profit sectors; and investing in promising 
research that can improve clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of 
transmission. Moving forward, we must continue to focus on populations 
with the highest HIV disparities--including gay men, and African 
American and Latino communities--and scale up effective, evidence-based 
interventions to prevent and treat HIV. We are also implementing the 
Affordable Care Act, which has expanded access to HIV testing and will 
ensure that all Americans, including those living with HIV/AIDS, have 
access to health insurance beginning in 2014.
These actions are bringing us closer to an AIDS-free generation at home 
and abroad--a goal that, while ambitious, is within sight. Through the 
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), we are on track to 
meet the HIV prevention and treatment targets I set last year. We are 
working with partners at home and abroad to reduce new infections in 
adults,

[[Page 186]]

help people with HIV/AIDS live longer, prevent mother-to-child 
transmission, and support the global effort to eliminate new infections 
in children by 2015. And thanks to bipartisan action to lift the entry 
ban on persons living with HIV, we were proud to welcome leaders from 
around the world to the 19th International AIDS Conference in 
Washington, D.C.
Creating an AIDS-free generation is a shared responsibility. It requires 
commitment from partner countries, coupled with support from donors, 
civil society, people living with HIV, faith-based organizations, the 
private sector, foundations, and multilateral institutions. We stand at 
a tipping point in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and working together, we 
can realize our historic opportunity to bring that fight to an end.
Today, we reflect on the strides we have taken toward overcoming HIV/
AIDS, honor those who have made our progress possible, and keep in our 
thoughts all those who have known the devastating consequences of this 
illness. The road toward an AIDS-free generation is long--but as we mark 
this important observance, let us also remember that if we move forward 
every day with the same passion, persistence, and drive that has brought 
us this far, we can reach our goal. We can beat this disease. On World 
AIDS Day, in memory of those no longer with us and in solidarity with 
all who carry on the fight, let us pledge to make that vision a reality.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States do hereby proclaim December 1, 2012, as 
World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to 
AIDS and to provide support and comfort to those living with this 
disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8910 of November 30, 2012

Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resilience Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, Americans across our country--from entrepreneurs and college 
students to families and community leaders--rely on critical 
infrastructure to travel and communicate, work and play. The assets and 
systems we depend on are essential to our way of life, and during 
Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resilience Month, we maintain our 
commitment to keeping our critical infrastructure and our communities 
safe and resilient.

[[Page 187]]

Our Nation's critical infrastructure is complex and interconnected, and 
we must understand not only its strengths, but also its vulnerabilities 
to emerging threats. Cyber incidents can have devastating consequences 
on both physical and virtual infrastructure, which is why my 
Administration continues to make cybersecurity a national security 
priority. As we continue to work within existing authorities to fortify 
our country against cyber risks, comprehensive legislation remains 
essential to improving infrastructure security, enhancing cyber 
information sharing between government and the private sector, and 
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of the American people.
Physical threats also put our Nation's most important assets at risk. 
Destruction caused by devastating storms and other natural disasters 
this year underscored our reliance on our critical infrastructure. Yet, 
these tragic events also demonstrated once again the strength and 
resolve of the American people when we work together to recover and 
rebuild. As long as we keep fortifying partnerships between Federal, 
State, and local governments and among community leaders and the private 
sector, we can continue to modernize our critical infrastructure and 
bolster our ability to overcome whatever challenges we may face.
All Americans have a part to play in protecting our critical 
infrastructure and making it more resilient, and my Administration 
continues to engage stakeholders in doing what it takes to keep our 
people safe and our assets secure. This month, we rededicate ourselves 
to raising awareness of the importance of critical infrastructure and to 
doing all we can to protect it. Americans can learn more about how they 
can get involved by visiting www.Ready.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2012 as 
Critical Infrastructure Protection and Resilience Month. I call upon the 
people of the United States to recognize the importance of protecting 
our Nation's resources and to observe this month with appropriate events 
and training to enhance our national security and resilience.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8911 of November 30, 2012

National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans gather with friends and family to share in the holiday 
season, National Impaired Driving Prevention Month reminds us of the 
importance of celebrating safely. Every year, accidents involving drunk, 
drugged,

[[Page 188]]

or distracted driving claim thousands of lives, leaving families to face 
the heartbreak of losing a loved one. We stand with all those who have 
known the tragic consequences of drugged or drunk driving, and we 
rededicate ourselves to preventing it this December and throughout the 
year.
Alcohol and drugs present serious risks to all drivers. It is well known 
that drugs, including some prescription medications, can impair the 
skills necessary for safe and responsible driving. Distractions like 
using mobile phones and other electronics behind the wheel also make our 
roads more hazardous. To reduce the prevalence of impaired driving, my 
Administration is working to raise public awareness, improve impaired 
driving screening procedures, and ensure law enforcement officers get 
the training they need. We are also striving to stop substance abuse 
before it starts by supporting local prevention programs and providing 
youth with the facts about alcohol and drug use.
Families play an essential part in stopping impaired driving. By talking 
about the risks and setting clear expectations, parents and other 
caregivers can help their children stay safe, sober, and focused on the 
road. Educators, health care providers, and community leaders can join 
in that important work by promoting responsible decisionmaking and 
encouraging young people to live free of drugs and alcohol.
This month, we recommit to keeping our streets safe, our families 
healthy, and our communities strong. To learn more about impaired 
driving and how all of us can work to prevent it, visit 
www.WhiteHouse.gov/ONDCP and www.NHTSA.gov/Impaired.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2012 as 
National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make 
responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired 
driving.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8912 of November 30, 2012

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

At the core of who we are as a Nation is a fundamental belief: that no 
matter who you are, no matter what you look like, no matter where you 
come from, if you have an idea and a willingness to work hard, you can 
succeed. It is this belief that leads a worker to leave a job to become 
her own boss, propels a basement inventor to sell a new product, or 
drives an amateur

[[Page 189]]

chef to open a restaurant. It is this belief that has drawn millions to 
our shores and spurred America's prosperity for centuries.
The belief in tomorrow's promise is guiding minority entrepreneurs 
across our country to start the kinds of businesses that make up the 
backbone of our economy. With a combined economic output of $1 trillion, 
minority-owned firms are key producers in an array of industries, hubs 
of innovation and new technology, and engines of job creation in our 
communities.
Because the continued growth and success of minority enterprises is 
essential to our economic recovery, my Administration has taken steps to 
help bolster these businesses. Through the Minority Business Development 
Agency, we are providing access to capital, consulting, contracts, and 
markets to minority entrepreneurs seeking to expand their businesses at 
home and overseas. We are also making it easier for business owners to 
find Federal resources with www.BusinessUSA.gov, a centralized, one-stop 
platform for businesses to access services to help them grow and hire.
As the number and size of minority-owned firms continue to expand, we 
must harness the diversity and power of these businesses to help 
strengthen our economy and put people back to work. As we celebrate the 
30th anniversary of Minority Enterprise Development Week, let us honor 
the role America's minority-owned businesses play in spurring our 
prosperity and recommit to equipping them with the tools for success in 
the 21st century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2 through 
December 8, 2012, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon 
all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of our 
Nation's minority enterprises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8913 of December 3, 2012

International Day of Persons With Disabilities, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans have always understood that each of us is entitled to a set of 
fundamental freedoms and protections under the law, and that when 
everyone gets a fair shot at opportunity, all of us do better. For more 
than two decades, our country has upheld those basic promises for 
persons with disabilities through the Americans with Disabilities Act--a 
sweeping civil rights bill that moved our Nation forward in the journey 
to equality for all. And from making health care more affordable to 
ensuring new technologies

[[Page 190]]

are accessible, we have continued to build on that progress, guided by 
the belief that equal access and equal opportunity are common principles 
that unite us as one Nation.
On the 20th International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we reaffirm 
that the struggle to ensure the rights of every person does not end at 
our borders, but extends to every country and every community. It 
continues for the woman who is at greater risk of abuse because of a 
disability and for the child who is denied the chance to get an 
education because of the way he was born. It goes on for the 1 billion 
people with disabilities worldwide who all too often cannot attend 
school, find work, access medical care, or receive fair treatment. These 
injustices are an affront to our shared humanity--which is why the 
United States has joined 153 other countries around the world in signing 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which calls 
on all nations to establish protections and liberties like those 
afforded under the Americans with Disabilities Act. While Americans with 
disabilities already enjoy these rights at home, they frequently face 
barriers when they travel, conduct business, study, or reside overseas. 
Ratifying the Convention in the Senate would reaffirm America's position 
as the global leader on disability rights and better position us to 
encourage progress toward inclusion, equal opportunity, full 
participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for 
persons with disabilities worldwide.
We have come far in the long march to achieve equal opportunity for all. 
But even as we partner with countries across the globe in affirming 
universal human rights, we know our work will not be finished until the 
inherent dignity and worth of all persons with disabilities is 
guaranteed. Today, let us renew our commitment to meeting that challenge 
here in the United States, and let us redouble our efforts to build new 
paths to participation, empowerment, and progress around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 3, 2012, as 
International Day of Persons with Disabilities. I call on all Americans 
to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8914 of December 6, 2012

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On December 7, 1941, our Nation suffered one of the most devastating 
attacks ever to befall the American people. In less than 2 hours, the 
bombs that rained on Pearl Harbor robbed thousands of men, women, and 
children

[[Page 191]]

of their lives; in little more than a day, our country was thrust into 
the greatest conflict the world had ever known. We mark this anniversary 
by honoring the patriots who perished more than seven decades ago, 
extending our thoughts and prayers to the loved ones they left behind, 
and showing our gratitude to a generation of service members who carried 
our Nation through some of the 20th century's darkest moments.
In his address to the Congress, President Franklin D. Roosevelt affirmed 
that ``with confidence in our Armed Forces--with the unbounding 
determination of our people--we will gain the inevitable triumph.'' 
Millions stood up and shipped out to meet that call to service, fighting 
heroically on Europe's distant shores and pressing island by island 
across the Pacific. Millions more carried out the fight in factories and 
shipyards here at home, building the arsenal of democracy that propelled 
America to the victory President Roosevelt foresaw. On every front, we 
faced down impossible odds--and out of the ashes of conflict, America 
rose more prepared than ever to meet the challenges of the day, sure 
that there was no trial we could not overcome.
Today, we pay solemn tribute to America's sons and daughters who made 
the ultimate sacrifice at Oahu. As we do, let us also reaffirm that 
their legacy will always burn bright--whether in the memory of those who 
knew them, the spirit of service that guides our men and women in 
uniform today, or the heart of the country they kept strong and free.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2012, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn day of 
remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and 
interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the 
United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of those American 
patriots who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8915 of December 10, 2012

Human Rights Day and Human Rights Week, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty-four years ago, a group of nations emerging from the shadow of war 
joined together to light a path toward lasting peace. They adopted the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights--a revolutionary document that 
recognized the inherent dignity and inalienable rights of all people as 
the ``foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world.'' As we 
mark the

[[Page 192]]

anniversary of that historic act, we celebrate the rights the 
Declaration recognized and recommit to strengthening them in the 21st 
century.
The United States was built on the promise that freedom and fairness are 
not endowed only to some--they are the birthright of all. Ordinary 
Americans have fought to fully realize that vision for more than two 
centuries, courageously forging a democracy that empowers each of us 
equally and affords every citizen due process under the law. Just as we 
have cultivated these rights here at home, so have we worked to promote 
them abroad. Societies across the globe are reaching toward a future 
where leaders are fairly and duly elected; where everyone can get an 
education and make a good living; where women and girls are free from 
violence, as well as free to pursue the same opportunities as men and 
boys; and where the voice of the people rings clear and true. As they 
do, the United States stands with them, ready to uphold the basic 
decency and human rights that underlie everything we have achieved and 
all our progress yet to come.
Men and women everywhere long for the freedom to determine their 
destiny, the dignity that comes with work, the comfort that comes with 
faith, and the justice that exists when governments serve their people. 
These dreams are common to people all around the world, and the values 
they represent are universal. This week, we rededicate ourselves to 
fortifying civil rights in America, while reaffirming that all people 
around the world should live free from the threat of extrajudicial 
killing, torture, oppression, and discrimination. And we renew our 
promise that the United States will be a partner to any nation, large or 
small, that will contribute to a world that is more peaceful and more 
prosperous, more just and more free.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2012, as 
Human Rights Day and the week beginning December 10, 2012, as Human 
Rights Week. I call upon the people of the United States to mark these 
observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8916 of December 14, 2012

Bill of Rights Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the 150th anniversary of 
our Nation's Bill of Rights, he called it the ``great American charter 
of personal liberty and human dignity.'' He understood that the freedoms 
it protects--among them speech, worship, assembly, and due process--are 
freedoms that reinforce one another. They form the bedrock of the 
American promise, and we cannot fully realize one without realizing them 
all. Today,

[[Page 193]]

as we work to reinforce human rights at home and around the globe, we 
reaffirm our belief that government of the people, by the people, and 
for the people inspires the stability and individual opportunity that 
serve as a basis for peace in our world.
In adopting the 10 Constitutional Amendments that make up the Bill of 
Rights, the Framers sought to balance the power and security of a new 
Federal Government with a guarantee of our most basic civil liberties. 
They acted on a conviction that rings as true today as it did two 
centuries ago: Unlocking a nation's potential depends on empowering all 
its people. The Framers also called upon posterity to carry on their 
work--to keep our country moving forward and bring us ever closer to a 
more perfect Union.
Generations of patriots have taken up that challenge. They have been 
defenders who stood watch at freedom's frontier, marchers who broke down 
barriers to full equality, dreamers who pushed America from what it was 
toward what it ought to be. Now it falls to us to build on their work. 
On Bill of Rights Day, we celebrate the liberties secured by our 
forebears, pay tribute to all who have fought to protect and expand our 
civil rights, and rededicate ourselves to driving a new century of 
American progress.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 15, 2012, as 
Bill of Rights Day. I call upon the people of the United States to mark 
these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8918 of December 17, 2012

Wright Brothers Day, 2012

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

After years of research and experimentation, 12 seconds of powered 
flight over the hills of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, vindicated the 
passion and resolve with which Wilbur and Orville Wright pursued their 
lifelong dream. Like so many Americans before and after them, these two 
men achieved the unthinkable, and their achievements changed our way of 
life. On Wright Brothers Day, we reflect on their astonishing feat and 
celebrate the ambition it still inspires more than a century later.
Wilbur and Orville Wright were the kind of entrepreneurs Americans 
everywhere root for. Their inspiration sparked from their mother, 
Susan--a gifted mathematician in her own right who challenged her 
children to think big and dream bold. The brothers overcame years of 
personal hardship to open their own bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio, 
quickly improving on the designs of the bikes they sold and eventually 
expanding to manufacture their own models. As they mastered their craft, 
they turned their attention skyward. Similar stories of resilient, canny 
entrepreneurship have unfolded throughout our Nation's history--from the 
founding of our airlines and auto industry to the growth of our research 
institutions and small businesses. While each journey has been unique, 
all have advanced that same brand of rugged determination to stay ahead 
of the curve and keep America moving forward.
With their game-changing feat, the Wright brothers earned their place in 
history as innovators who helped trigger America's rise as an economic 
superpower, and whose example inspired the kind of businesses and 
industries that built and grew our middle class. As we mark Wright 
Brothers Day, let us carry their legacy forward by taking on new 
challenges with tenacity and meeting our hardships with courage, 
confident that our shared future is bright and our best days are still 
ahead.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as 
amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of 
each year as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested 
the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of 
the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2012, as Wright Brothers Day.

Russian Federation acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 
August 22, 2012. The extension of permanent normal trade relations 
treatment to the products of the Russian Federation will permit the

no longer apply to the Russian Federation.
3. The Republic of Moldova has been found in full compliance with the 
freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the 1974 Act since

To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act and 
for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the 
African

[[Page 197]]

Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) (AGOA), 
authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of 
the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country'' if the President determines that the country meets the 
eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 
3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an ``eligible sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.
3. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 
1974 Act, I have determined that the Republic of South Sudan meets the 
eligibility requirements set forth or referenced therein, and I have 
decided to designate the Republic of South Sudan an eligible sub-Saharan 
African country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
4. Section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(3)) authorizes 
the President to terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 506A if he 
determines that the country is not making continual progress in meeting 
the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act.
5. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the Republic of Mali and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau are not 
making continual progress in meeting the requirements described in 
section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act. Accordingly, I have decided to 
terminate the designations of the Republic of Mali and the Republic of 
Guinea-Bissau as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries for purposes 
of section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on January 1, 2013.
6. Section 502(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(e)) provides that the 
President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences 
(GSP) if the President determines that such country has become a ``high-
income'' country as defined by the official statistics of the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Termination is 
effective on January 1 of the second year following the year in which 
such determination is made.
7. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that 
the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis has become a ``high-income'' 
country. I am terminating the designation of that country as a 
beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective 
January 1, 2014, and I will so notify the Congress.
8. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the 
Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel 
(USIFTA), which the Congress approved in the United States-Israel Free 
Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the ``USIFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2112 note).
9. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President 
determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of 
reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel 
provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, 
suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such 
continuance of existing

[[Page 198]]

duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the 
President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the 
USIFTA.
10. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, 
on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with 
Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products 
during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the ``2004 
Agreement'').
11. In Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 
Agreement, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the 
USIFTA Act, that it was necessary in order to maintain the general level 
of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to 
Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the 
United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of 
certain agricultural products of Israel.
12. In 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, the United States and Israel entered 
into agreements to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement was in 
force for 1-year periods to allow additional time for the two 
governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.
13. To carry out the extension agreements, the President in Proclamation 
8334 of December 31, 2008; Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009; 
Proclamation 8618 of December 21, 2010; and Proclamation 8770 of 
December 29, 2011, modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) to provide duty-free access into the United States for 
specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel, each 
time for an additional 1-year period.
14. On November 19, 2012, the United States entered into an agreement 
with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force 
through December 31, 2013, to allow for further negotiations on an 
agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.
15. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that 
it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal 
and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided 
for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States 
through the close of December 31, 2013, for specified quantities of 
certain agricultural products of Israel.
16. In Presidential Proclamation 8771 of December 29, 2011, pursuant to 
the authority provided in section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the ``1988 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)), I 
modified the HTS to reflect amendments to the International Convention 
on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the 
``Convention'').
17. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA) with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to the United States-Chile Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USCFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), 
incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and rules of 
origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USCFTA.
18. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in 
rates of duty for originating goods of Chile in tariff categories that 
were modified to reflect amendments to the Convention, Presidential 
Proclamation 8771

[[Page 199]]

made modifications to the HTS that I determined were necessary or 
appropriate to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 
7746.
19. Chile is a party to the Convention. Because the substance of the 
changes to the Convention are reflected in slightly differing form in 
its national tariff schedule, the rules of origin set out in the USCFTA 
must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment 
accorded under the USCFTA to originating goods will continue to be 
provided under the tariff categories that were modified in Proclamation 
8771. The United States and Chile have agreed to make these changes to 
certain rules of origin set out in the USCFTA.
20. Section 202 of the USCFTA Act provides rules for determining whether 
goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a 
USCFTA Party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment 
contemplated under the USCFTA. Section 202(o) of the USCFTA Act 
authorizes the President to proclaim, as part of the HTS, the rules of 
origin set out in the USCFTA and to proclaim any modifications to such 
previously proclaimed rules of origin, subject to the exceptions stated 
in section 202(o)(2)(A).
21. Presidential Proclamation 8840 of June 29, 2012, modified the HTS to 
reflect changes to duty-free treatment under the GSP. Annex I to that 
proclamation included an error in the list of subheading numbers to be 
added at general note 4(d) to the HTS, and I have determined that a 
modification to the HTS is necessary to correct that technical error.
22. Presidential Proclamation 8894 of October 29, 2012, pursuant to the 
authority provided under section 202(o)(2)(B)(ii) of the United States-
Korea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, modified the HTS, through 
section E of Annex III of Publication 4349 of the United States 
International Trade Commission (the ``Commission''), to correct a 
clerical error regarding a provision of chapter 61 (as included in Annex 
4-A of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement).
23. Section E of Annex III of Publication 4349 contained a typographical 
error within the correction that needs to be corrected. I have 
determined that a modification to the HTS is necessary to correct this 
typographical error and to provide the intended tariff treatment.
24. Presidential Proclamation 8894 of October 29, 2012, modified the HTS 
as provided in Annex II of Publication 4349 of the Commission to 
implement the initial stage of duty elimination provided for in the 
United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement and to provide for 
further staged reductions in duties for originating goods of Panama. The 
proclamation erroneously referred to ``originating goods of Colombia'' 
and should instead refer to ``originating goods of Panama.''
25. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions 
of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions 
taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
title

[[Page 200]]

V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, section 104 of the AGOA, section 4 of 
the USIFTA Act, and section 202 of the USCFTA Act do proclaim that:

(1) The Republic of South Sudan is designated as an eligible sub-Saharan 
African country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.

(4) In order to reflect in the HTS that beginning on January 1, 2013, the 
Republic of Mali and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau shall no longer be 
designated as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, general note 16(a) 
to the HTS is modified by deleting ``Republic of Mali'' and ``Republic of 
Guinea-Bissau'' from the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. 
Further, note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS is modified 
by deleting ``Republic of Guinea-Bissau'' and ``Republic of Mali'' from the 
list of lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.

(5) The designation of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis as a 
beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP is terminated, 
effective on January 1, 2014.

(6) In order to reflect this termination in the HTS, general note 4(a) to 
the HTS is modified by deleting ``St. Kitts and Nevis'' from the list of 
independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2014.

(7) In order to implement U.S. tariff commitments under the 2004 Agreement 
through December 31, 2013, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I to 
this proclamation.

proclamation shall be effective with respect to eligible agricultural 
products of Israel that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after January 1, 2013.

    (b) The provisions of subchapter VIII of chapter 99 of the 
HTS, as modified by Annex I to this proclamation, shall continue 
in effect through December 31, 2013.

(9) In order to reflect in the HTS the modifications to the rules of origin 
under the USCFTA, general note 26 to the HTS is modified as provided in 
Annex II to this proclamation.

(10) In order to correct a technical error in the list of subheading 
numbers at general note 4(d) to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth 
in section A of Annex III to this proclamation.

(11) In order to provide the intended tariff treatment to goods of Korea 
under the terms of general note 33, the HTS is modified as set forth in 
section B of Annex III to this proclamation.

(12) Paragraph (3) of Presidential Proclamation 8894 is amended to correct 
an inadvertent error by replacing ``Colombia'' with ``Panama.''

[[Page 201]]

(13) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are 
inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to 
the extent of such inconsistency.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8922 of December 31, 2012

National Mentoring Month, 2013

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our American family is bound together by caring individuals who make it 
their mission to serve others. During National Mentoring Month, we pay 
special tribute to the men and women who enrich the lives of our young 
people and fortify the unbreakable bonds between one generation and the 
next.
Mentors know that helping a child unlock their full potential begins 
with care, guidance, and support--which is why my Administration is 
proud to celebrate mentorship nationwide through programs that help 
young people see the strength within themselves. We created the 
Corporate Mentoring Challenge, which encourages businesses across our 
country to open or expand mentoring programs that equip our youth with 
the tools to achieve. We have connected young men and women in the 
Washington, DC, area with mentors at the White House, and we have 
partnered with groups across the public, private, and nonprofit sectors 
to build pathways to summer job opportunities for low-income and 
disconnected youth. And since 2010, we have worked to build strong 
connections between children and responsible adults through our 
Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative.
A supportive mentor can mean the difference between struggle and 
success. As we mark this important occasion, I encourage all Americans 
to spend time as a mentor and help lift our next generation toward their 
hopes and dreams. To learn more about how to get involved, visit 
www.Serve.gov/Mentor.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2013 as 
National Mentoring Month. I call upon public officials, business and 
community leaders, educators, and Americans across the country to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8923 of December 31, 2012

150th Anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On December 31, 1862, our Nation marked the end of another year of civil 
war. At Shiloh and Seven Pines, Harpers Ferry and Antietam, brother had 
fought against brother. Sister had fought against sister. Blood and 
bitterness had deepened the divide that separated North from South, 
eroding the bonds of affection that once united 34 States under a single 
flag. Slavery still suspended the possibility of an America where life 
and liberty were the birthright of all, not the province of some.
Yet, even in those dark days, light persisted. Hope endured. As the 
weariness of an old year gave way to the promise of a new one, President 
Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation--courageously 
declaring that on January 1, 1863, ``all persons held as slaves'' in 
rebellious areas ``shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.'' He 
opened the Union Army and Navy to African Americans, giving new strength 
to liberty's cause. And with that document, President Lincoln lent new 
moral force to the war by making it a fight not just to preserve, but 
also to empower. He sought to reunite our people not only in government, 
but also in freedom that knew no bounds of color or creed. Every battle 
became a battle for liberty itself. Every struggle became a struggle for 
equality.
Our 16th President also understood that while each of us is entitled to 
our individual rights and responsibilities, there are certain things we 
cannot accomplish on our own. Only a Union could serve the hopes of 
every citizen, knocking down the barriers to opportunity and giving each 
of us the chance to pursue our highest aspirations. He knew that in 
these United States, no dream could ever be beyond our reach when we 
affirm that individual liberty is served, not negated, by seeking the 
common good.
It is that spirit that made emancipation possible and codified it in our 
Constitution. It is that belief in what we can do together that moved 
millions to march for justice in the years that followed. And today, it 
is a legacy we choose not only to remember, but also to make our own. 
Let us begin this new year by renewing our bonds to one another and 
reinvesting in the work that lies ahead, confident that we can keep 
driving freedom's progress in our time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 1, 2013, as 
the 150th Anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities that celebrate the Emancipation Proclamation and reaffirm the 
timeless principles it upheld.

[[Page 208]]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8924 of December 31, 2012

National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, 2013

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This month, we rededicate ourselves to stopping one of the greatest 
human rights abuses of our time. Around the world, millions of men, 
women, and children are bought, sold, beaten, and abused, locked in 
compelled service and hidden in darkness. They toil in factories and 
fields; in brothels and sweatshops; at sea, abroad, and at home. They 
are the victims of human trafficking--a crime that amounts to modern-day 
slavery.
As Americans, we have long rejected such cruelty. We have recognized it 
as a debasement of our common humanity and an affront to the principles 
we cherish. And for more than a century, we have made it a national 
mission to bring slavery and human trafficking to an end.
My Administration has been deeply committed to carrying this legacy 
forward--beginning with trafficking that happens on our own shores. We 
have strengthened protections so all workers know their rights, expanded 
efforts to identify and serve domestic victims, devoted new resources to 
dismantling trafficking networks, and put more traffickers behind bars 
than ever before. In the months ahead, we will continue to take action 
by empowering investigators and law enforcement with the training they 
need, and by engaging businesses, advocates, and students in developing 
cutting-edge tools people can use to stay safe. We will invest in 
helping trafficking victims rebuild their lives. And as one of the 
world's largest purchasers of goods and services, the Federal Government 
will keep leading by example, further strengthening protections to help 
ensure that American tax dollars never support forced labor.
Our commitment to stopping human trafficking does not end at our 
borders. As a leader in the global movement to combat this scourge, the 
United States has renewed sanctions on governments that harbor the worst 
offenders. We have partnered with groups around the world to help men, 
women, and children escape their abusers. And recognizing that no 
country can meet this challenge alone, we have aided others in 
addressing modern slavery's root causes, and encouraged nations across 
the globe to pass comprehensive anti-trafficking laws, enforce them 
rigorously, and care for survivors.
We know the road ahead is long, and change will not come easily. But as 
we renew our pledge to erase modern forms of slavery from the face of 
this earth, let us also draw strength from the movements of the past. We 
recall

[[Page 209]]

the words of the Emancipation Proclamation--that every life saved is 
``an act of justice,'' worthy of ``the considerate judgment of mankind, 
and the gracious favor of an Almighty God.'' We reflect on the Amendment 
that wrote abolition into law, the decades of struggle to make its 
promise real, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that has 
drawn nations together in the pursuit of equality and justice. These 
achievements once seemed impossible--but on this day, let us remember 
that they were not, and let us press on toward the future we know is 
possible.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2013 as 
National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in 
the annual celebration of National Freedom Day on February 1. I call 
upon businesses, organizations, faith-based groups, families, and all 
Americans to recognize the vital role we can play in ending all forms of 
slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Proclamation 8925 of December 31, 2012

National Stalking Awareness Month, 2013

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, millions of Americans face the fear, isolation, and danger of 
being victims of stalking. At some point in their lives, 1 in 6 women 
and 1 in 19 men will be stalked, and many of these crimes will go 
unreported and unprosecuted. During National Stalking Awareness Month, 
we rededicate ourselves to supporting victims of stalking and sharpen 
our resolve to bring perpetrators to justice.
Stalking is a pattern of unwanted contact that causes victims to fear 
for their safety or the safety of family members. It can include implied 
or explicit threats; harassment; or nonconsensual communication through 
phone calls, text messages, or emails. The perpetrator is usually 
someone the victim knows. Stalking behaviors may appear innocuous to 
outside observers, but victims often endure intense physical and 
emotional distress that affects every aspect of their lives. Many feel 
forced to move, or change jobs. Tragically, stalking tends to escalate 
over time, and it is sometimes followed by sexual assault or homicide.
My Administration remains committed to building a robust criminal 
justice response to stalking--one that holds offenders accountable, 
offers protection and support to all victims of violence, and empowers 
them to break the cycle of abuse. In January 2012, we held the first-
ever White House

[[Page 210]]

stalking roundtable with survivors, law enforcement officers, victim 
advocates, and researchers. We have built partnerships with communities 
across the Nation to implement anti-stalking efforts. And we continue to 
support nonprofit organizations and local, State, and tribal governments 
as they develop more effective responses to violence against women--
including direct services, crisis intervention, transitional housing, 
legal assistance to victims, court improvement, and training for law 
enforcement and courts.
We are also working to address the threat of cyberstalking. While 
advances in technology are making this crime more prevalent, they can 
also pose unique opportunities to address it. Communities are developing 
new tools that help connect victims to local services, and State 
governments are updating statutes to further protect people from 
cyberstalking. Through our Apps Against Abuse challenge, my 
Administration recognized mobile applications that are empowering people 
to defend themselves against dating violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking.
Thanks to the dedicated work of law enforcement officials, community 
leaders, advocates, organizations, and survivors, our country has made 
great strides in combating stalking. During National Stalking Awareness 
Month, we resolve to keep building on this momentum until no American 
lives in fear of this crime.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2013 as 
National Stalking Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to 
recognize the signs of stalking, acknowledge stalking as a serious 
crime, and urge those impacted not to be afraid to speak out or ask for 
help. Let us also resolve to support victims and survivors, and to 
create communities that are secure and supportive for all Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
seventh.

Executive Order 13597 of January 19, 2012

Establishing Visa and Foreign Visitor Processing Goals and the Task 
Force on Travel and Competitiveness

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and to improve visa and foreign 
visitor processing and travel promotion in order to create jobs and spur 
economic growth in the United States, while continuing to protect our 
national security, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The travel and tourism industry is one of our 
Nation's leading service sectors and sources of exports. However, the 
U.S. market share of spending by international travelers fell from 17 
percent to 11 percent of the global market from 2000 to 2010, more than 
a 30 percent decrease in our share of the global market. This decrease 
was due primarily to increased international competition, changing 
patterns in global development, and, to some degree, more stringent 
security requirements imposed after 2001. Given the importance of the 
travel and tourism industry to the U.S. economy and job creation, a 
coordinated policy, consistent with protecting our national security, is 
needed to support a prosperous and secure travel and tourism industry in 
the United States.
Steady progress has been made since 2010, when my Administration 
launched the National Export Initiative and the Travel Promotion Act was 
signed into law. While our processes for moving people and goods across 
our borders are now both more secure and more efficient, new initiatives 
are needed to enable us to better capitalize on the economic 
opportunities presented by a dynamic 21st century travel and tourism 
industry.
Sec. 2. Visa and Foreign Visitor Processing. (a) The Assistant to the 
President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism shall, consistent 
with Presidential Policy Directive 1 or any successor documents and in 
coordination with the Assistant to the President and Cabinet Secretary, 
maintain an interagency process for coordinating the implementation of 
regulatory improvements and the evaluation of legislative proposals to 
enhance and expedite travel to and arrival in the United States by 
foreign nationals, consistent with national security requirements.
    (b) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security, in consultation 
with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and 
Counterterrorism,

[[Page 212]]

the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the heads of 
such agencies as appropriate, shall develop an implementation plan, 
within 60 days of the date of this order, describing actions to be 
undertaken, including those that build upon efforts underway, to achieve 
the following:

(i) increase nonimmigrant visa processing capacity in China and Brazil by 
40 percent over the coming year;

(ii) ensure that 80 percent of nonimmigrant visa applicants are interviewed 
within 3 weeks of receipt of application, recognizing that resource and 
security considerations and the need to ensure provision of consular 
services to U.S. citizens may dictate specific exceptions;

Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012

Blocking Property of the Government of Iran and Iranian Financial 
Institutions

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 1245 of the

I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, in order to 
take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, particularly in light of the 
deceptive practices of the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks 
to conceal transactions of sanctioned parties, the deficiencies in 
Iran's anti-money laundering regime and the weaknesses in its 
implementation, and the continuing and unacceptable risk posed to the 
international financial system by Iran's activities, hereby order:
Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property of the Government 
of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran, that are in the United 
States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any foreign branch, are blocked and may not be 
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.
    (b) All property and interests in property of any Iranian financial 
institution, including the Central Bank of Iran, that are in the United

person, including any foreign branch, are blocked and may not be 
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.
    (c) All property and interests in property that are in the United 
States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States

otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be owned or 
controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, 
directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order.
Sec. 2. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously 
impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 12957, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided 
by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not 
limited to: (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, 
goods, or

[[Page 216]]

services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.
Sec. 4. (a) The prohibitions in section 1 of this order apply except to 
the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, 
or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
    (b) The prohibitions in section 1 of this order do not apply to 
property and interests in property of the Government of Iran that were 
blocked pursuant to Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979, and 
thereafter made subject to the transfer directives set forth in 
Executive Order 12281 of January 19, 1981, and implementing regulations 
thereunder.
Sec. 5. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the 
prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 6. Nothing in section 1 of this order shall prohibit transactions 
for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government by 
employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.
Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term ``person'' means an 
individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;
    (d) the term ``Government of Iran'' means the Government of Iran, 
any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including 
the Central Bank of Iran, and any person owned or controlled by, or 
acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran;
    (e) the term ``Iran'' means the territory of Iran and any other 
territory or marine area, including the exclusive economic zone and 
continental shelf, over which the Government of Iran claims sovereignty, 
sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, provided that the Government of Iran 
exercises partial or total de facto control over the area or derives a 
benefit from economic activity in the area pursuant to international 
arrangements; and
    (f) the term ``Iranian financial institution'' means a financial 
institution organized under the laws of Iran or any jurisdiction within 
Iran (including foreign branches), any financial institution in Iran, 
any financial institution, wherever located, owned or controlled by the

owned or controlled by any of the foregoing.
Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence

[[Page 217]]

in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 12957, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination 
made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order, other than the purposes described in section 11. 
The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions and 
authorities to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to exercise the functions and 
authorities conferred upon the President by section 1245(d)(1)(A) of the 
NDAA and to redelegate these functions and authorities consistent with 
applicable law. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby further authorized to exercise the 
functions and authorities conferred upon the President by section 
1245(g)(1) of the NDAA to the extent necessary to exercise the other 
functions and authorities delegated in this section and may redelegate 
these functions and authorities consistent with applicable law.
Sec. 11. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of 
the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, and the Director of National 
Intelligence, is hereby authorized to exercise the functions and 
authorities conferred upon the President by section 1245(d)(4)(D) of the 
NDAA and to redelegate these functions and authorities consistent with 
applicable law. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
Secretary of the Treasury, is hereby further authorized to exercise the 
functions and authorities conferred upon the President by sections 
1245(e)(1) and 1245(e)(2) of the NDAA and to redelegate these functions 
and authorities consistent with applicable law. The Secretary of State,

authorized to exercise the functions and authorities conferred upon the 
President by section 1245(g)(1) of the NDAA to the extent necessary to 
exercise the other functions and authorities delegated in this section 
and may redelegate these functions and authorities consistent with

Executive Order 13602 of March 15, 2012

Establishing a White House Council on Strong Cities, Strong Communities

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to forge a 
partnership with local communities to provide them with comprehensive 
technical assistance to use and compete for Federal resources more 
effectively and efficiently, which will enable them to develop and 
implement economic strategies to become more competitive, sustainable, 
and inclusive, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Cities, towns, and regions across our Nation continue 
to face difficult economic challenges. Enhancing current Federal 
assistance is

[[Page 223]]

helping to lift communities out of distress. To allow the Federal 
Government to better partner with these local communities to build local 
capacity to address economic issues, and to support comprehensive 
planning and regional collaboration, my Administration established the 
Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2) pilot initiative. By partnering 
with cities and regions to augment their vision for stability and 
economic growth, the SC2 was designed to help communities strengthen 
their capacity to create jobs and more competitive business climates, 
and implement locally driven community and regional planning approaches 
that lead to sustained economic growth, as well as ensure that Federal 
assistance is more efficiently provided and used.

national defense preparedness. The authorities provided in the Act shall 
be used to strengthen this base and to ensure it is capable of 
responding to the national defense needs of the United States.
Sec. 103. General Functions. Executive departments and agencies

professional and technical personnel;
    (c) be prepared, in the event of a potential threat to the security 
of the United States, to take actions necessary to ensure the 
availability of adequate resources and production capability, including 
services and critical technology, for national defense requirements;

for research and development and for acquisition of materials, services, 
components, and equipment to enhance industrial base efficiency and 
responsiveness.
Sec. 104. Implementation. (a) The National Security Council and Homeland 
Security Council, in conjunction with the National Economic Council,

Executive Order 13604 of March 22, 2012

Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure 
Projects

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to significantly 
reduce the aggregate time required to make decisions in the permitting 
and review of infrastructure projects by the Federal Government, while 
improving environmental and community outcomes, it is hereby ordered as 
follows:
Section 1. Policy. (a) To maintain our Nation's competitive edge and 
ensure an economy built to last, the United States must have fast, 
reliable, resilient, and environmentally sound means of moving people, 
goods, energy, and information. In a global economy, we will compete for 
the world's investments based in significant part on the quality of our 
infrastructure. Investing in the Nation's infrastructure provides 
immediate and long-term economic benefits for local communities and the 
Nation as a whole.
The quality of our Nation's infrastructure depends in critical part on 
Federal permitting and review processes, including planning, approval, 
and consultation processes. These processes inform decision-makers and 
affected communities about the potential benefits and impacts of 
proposed infrastructure projects, and ensure that projects are designed, 
built, and maintained in a manner that is consistent with protecting our 
public health, welfare, safety, national security, and environment. 
Reviews and approvals of infrastructure projects can be delayed due to 
many factors beyond the control of the Federal Government, such as poor 
project design, incomplete applications, uncertain funding, or multiple 
reviews and approvals by State, local, tribal, or other jurisdictions. 
Given these factors, it is critical that executive departments and 
agencies (agencies) take all steps within their authority, consistent 
with available resources, to execute Federal permitting and review 
processes with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring the 
health, safety, and security of communities and the environment while 
supporting vital economic growth.
To achieve that objective, our Federal permitting and review processes 
must provide a transparent, consistent, and predictable path for both 
project sponsors and affected communities. They must ensure that 
agencies set and adhere to timelines and schedules for completion of 
reviews, set clear permitting performance goals, and track progress 
against those goals. They must encourage early collaboration among 
agencies, project sponsors, and affected stakeholders in order to 
incorporate and address their interests and minimize delays. They must 
provide for transparency and accountability by utilizing cost-effective 
information technology to collect and disseminate information about 
individual projects and agency performance, so

[[Page 238]]

that the priorities and concerns of all our citizens are considered. 
They must rely upon early and active consultation with State, local, and 
tribal governments to avoid conflicts or duplication of effort, resolve 
concerns, and allow for concurrent rather than sequential reviews. They 
must recognize the critical role project sponsors play in assuring the 
timely and cost-effective review of projects by providing complete 
information and analysis and by supporting, as appropriate, the costs 
associated with review. And, they must enable agencies to share 
priorities, work collaboratively and concurrently to advance reviews and 
permitting decisions, and facilitate the resolution of disputes at all 
levels of agency organization.
Each of these elements must be incorporated into routine agency practice 
to provide demonstrable improvements in the performance of Federal 
infrastructure permitting and review processes, including lower costs, 
more timely decisions, and a healthier and cleaner environment. Also, 
these elements must be integrated into project planning processes so 
that projects are designed appropriately to avoid, to the extent 
practicable, adverse impacts on public health, security, historic 
properties and other cultural resources, and the environment, and to 
minimize or mitigate impacts that may occur. Permitting and review 
process improvements that have proven effective must be expanded and 
institutionalized.
    (b) In advancing this policy, this order expands upon efforts 
undertaken pursuant to Executive Order 13580 of July 12, 2011 
(Interagency Working Group on Coordination of Domestic Energy 
Development and Permitting in Alaska), Executive Order 13563 of January 
18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review), and my memorandum 
of August 31, 2011 (Speeding Infrastructure Development Through More 
Efficient and Effective Permitting and Environmental Review), as well as 
other ongoing efforts.
Sec. 2. Steering Committee on Federal Infrastructure Permitting and 
Review Process Improvement. There is established a Steering Committee on 
Federal Infrastructure Permitting and Review Process Improvement 
(Steering Committee), to be chaired by the Chief Performance Officer 
(CPO), in consultation with the Chair of the Council on Environmental 
Quality (CEQ).
    (a) Infrastructure Projects Covered by this Order. The Steering 
Committee shall facilitate improvements in Federal permitting and review 
processes for infrastructure projects in sectors including surface 
transportation, aviation, ports and waterways, water resource projects, 
renewable energy generation, electricity transmission, broadband, 
pipelines, and other such sectors as determined by the Steering 
Committee.

Supporting Safe and Responsible Development of Unconventional Domestic 
Natural Gas Resources

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to coordinate the 
efforts of Federal agencies responsible for overseeing the safe and 
responsible development of unconventional domestic natural gas resources 
and associated infrastructure and to help reduce our dependence on oil, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. In 2011, natural gas provided 25 percent of the 
energy consumed in the United States. Its production creates jobs and 
provides economic benefits to the entire domestic production supply 
chain, as well as to chemical and other manufacturers, who benefit from 
lower feedstock and energy costs. By helping to power our transportation 
system, greater use of natural gas can also reduce our dependence on 
oil. And with appropriate safeguards, natural gas can provide a cleaner 
source of energy than other fossil fuels.
For these reasons, it is vital that we take full advantage of our 
natural gas resources, while giving American families and communities 
confidence that natural and cultural resources, air and water quality, 
and public health and safety will not be compromised.
While natural gas production is carried out by private firms, and States 
are the primary regulators of onshore oil and gas activities, the 
Federal Government has an important role to play by regulating oil and 
gas activities on public and Indian trust lands, encouraging greater use 
of natural gas in transportation, supporting research and development 
aimed at improving the safety of natural gas development and 
transportation activities, and setting sensible, cost-effective public 
health and environmental standards to implement Federal law and augment 
State safeguards.
Because efforts to promote safe, responsible, and efficient development 
of unconventional domestic natural gas resources are underway at a 
number of executive departments and agencies (agencies), close 
interagency coordination is important for effective implementation of 
these programs and activities. To formalize and promote ongoing 
interagency coordination, this order establishes a high-level, 
interagency working group that will facilitate coordinated 
Administration policy efforts to support safe and responsible 
unconventional domestic natural gas development.

[[Page 242]]

Sec. 2. Interagency Working Group to Support Safe and Responsible 
Development of Unconventional Domestic Natural Gas Resources. There is 
established an Interagency Working Group to Support Safe and Responsible 
Development of Unconventional Domestic Natural Gas Resources (Working 
Group), to be chaired by the Director of the Domestic Policy Council, or 
a designated representative.
    (a) Membership. In addition to the Chair, the Working Group shall 
include deputy-level representatives or equivalent officials, designated 
by the head of the respective agency or office, from:

(i) the Department of Defense;

(ii) the Department of the Interior;

(iii) the Department of Agriculture;

(iv) the Department of Commerce;

(v) the Department of Health and Human Services;

(vi) the Department of Transportation;

(vii) the Department of Energy;

(viii) the Department of Homeland Security;

(ix) the Environmental Protection Agency;

(x) the Council on Environmental Quality;

(xi) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;

(xii) the Office of Management and Budget;

(xiii) the National Economic Council; and

(xiv) such other agencies or offices as the Chair may invite to 
participate.

    (b) Functions. Consistent with the authorities and responsibilities 
of participating agencies and offices, the Working Group shall support 
the safe and responsible production of domestic unconventional natural 
gas by performing the following functions:

(i) coordinate agency policy activities, ensuring their efficient and 
effective operation and facilitating cooperation among agencies, as 
appropriate;

(ii) coordinate among agencies the sharing of scientific, environmental, 
and related technical and economic information;

(iii) engage in long-term planning and ensure coordination among the 
appropriate Federal entities with respect to such issues as research, 
natural resource assessment, and the development of infrastructure;

(iv) promote interagency communication with stakeholders; and

(v) consult with other agencies and offices as appropriate.

Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented 
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of 
appropriations.
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Blocking the Property and Suspending Entry Into the United States of 
Certain Persons With Respect to Grave Human Rights Abuses by the 
Governments of Iran and Syria via Information Technology

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 212(f) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), 
and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, hereby 
determine that the commission of serious human rights abuses against the 
people of Iran and Syria by their governments, facilitated by computer 
and network disruption, monitoring, and tracking by those governments, 
and abetted by entities in Iran and Syria that are complicit in their 
governments' malign use of technology for those purposes, threaten the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States. The 
Governments of Iran and Syria are endeavoring to rapidly upgrade their 
technological ability to conduct such activities. Cognizant of the vital 
importance of providing technology that enables the Iranian and Syrian 
people to freely communicate with each other and the outside world, as 
well as the preservation, to the extent possible, of global 
telecommunications supply chains for essential products and services to 
enable the free flow of information, the measures in this order are 
designed primarily to address the need to prevent entities located in 
whole or in part in Iran and Syria from facilitating or committing 
serious human rights abuses. In order to take additional steps with 
respect to the national emergencies declared in Executive Order 12957 of 
March 15, 1995, as relied upon for additional steps in subsequent 
Executive Orders, and in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004, as 
modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps in subsequent 
Executive Orders, and to address the situation described above, I hereby 
order:
Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any foreign branch, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:

(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and

[[Page 244]]

(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with or at the recommendation of the Secretary of State:

  (A) to have operated, or to have directed the operation of, information 
and communications technology that facilitates computer or network 
disruption, monitoring, or tracking that could assist in or enable serious 
human rights abuses by or on behalf of the Government of Iran or the 
Government of Syria;

  (B) to have sold, leased, or otherwise provided, directly or indirectly, 
goods, services, or technology to Iran or Syria likely to be used to 
facilitate computer or network disruption, monitoring, or tracking that 
could assist in or enable serious human rights abuses by or on behalf of 
the Government of Iran or the Government of Syria;

  (C) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in 
support of, the activities described in subsections (a)(ii)(A) and (B) of 
this section or any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order; or

  (D) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

    (b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except 
to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 2. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my 
ability to deal with the two national emergencies identified in the 
preamble to this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided 
by section 1 of this order.
Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not 
limited to:
    (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.
Sec. 4. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant 
entry into the United States of aliens who meet one or more of the 
criteria in section 1 of this order would be detrimental to the 
interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend the entry into the 
United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such 
persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 
8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United 
Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act Sanctions).
Sec. 5. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, causes

[[Page 245]]

a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 6. Nothing in section 1 of this order shall prohibit transactions 
for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government 
by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.
Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``information and communications technology'' means any 
hardware, software, or other product or service primarily intended to 
fulfill or enable the function of information processing and 
communication by electronic means, including transmission and display, 
including via the Internet;
    (c) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
    (d) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;
    (e) the term ``Government of Iran'' means the Government of Iran, 
any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including 
the Central Bank of Iran, and any person owned or controlled by, or 
acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran; and
    (f) the term ``Government of Syria'' means the Government of the 
Syrian Arab Republic, its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled 
entities.
Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the two national emergencies identified in the 
preamble to this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or 
determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers

purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine that circumstances 
no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property 
of a person listed in the Annex to this order and to take necessary 
action to give effect to that determination.

[[Page 246]]

Sec. 11. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity 
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
Sec. 12. The measures taken pursuant to this order with respect to Iran 
are in response to actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the 
conclusion of the 1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a 
response to those later actions.

April 23, 2012.

Executive Order 13607 of April 27, 2012

Establishing Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions 
Serving Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Members

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to ensure that 
Federal military and veterans educational benefits programs are 
providing service members, veterans, spouses, and other family members 
with the information, support, and protections they deserve, it is 
hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The original GI Bill, approved just weeks after D-
Day, educated nearly 8 million Americans and helped transform this 
Nation. We owe the same obligations to this generation of service men 
and women as was afforded that previous one. This is the promise of the 
Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (title V, Public 
Law 110-252) (Post-9/11 GI Bill) and the continued provision of 
educational benefits in the Department of Defense's Tuition Assistance 
Program (10 U.S.C. 2007): to provide our service members, veterans, 
spouses, and other family members the opportunity to pursue a high-
quality education and gain the skills and training they need to fill the 
jobs of tomorrow.
Since the Post-9/11 GI Bill became law, there have been reports of 
aggressive and deceptive targeting of service members, veterans, and 
their families by some educational institutions. For example, some 
institutions have recruited veterans with serious brain injuries and 
emotional vulnerabilities without providing academic support and 
counseling; encouraged service members and veterans to take out costly 
institutional loans rather than encouraging them to apply for Federal 
student loans first; engaged in misleading recruiting practices on 
military installations; and failed to disclose meaningful information 
that allows potential students to determine whether the institution has 
a good record of graduating service members, veterans, and their 
families and positioning them for success in the workforce.
To ensure our service members, veterans, spouses, and other family 
members have the information they need to make informed decisions 
concerning their well-earned Federal military and veterans educational 
benefits, I am directing my Administration to develop Principles of 
Excellence to strengthen oversight, enforcement, and accountability 
within these benefits programs.
Sec. 2. Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving 
Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Members. The 
Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education shall establish 
Principles of Excellence (Principles) to apply to educational 
institutions receiving funding from Federal military and veterans 
educational benefits programs, including benefits programs provided by 
the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Tuition Assistance Program. The Principles 
should ensure that these educational institutions provide meaningful 
information to service members, veterans, spouses, and other family 
members about the financial cost and quality of educational institutions 
to assist those prospective students in making choices about how to use 
their Federal educational benefits; prevent abusive and deceptive 
recruiting practices that target the recipients of Federal

[[Page 249]]

military and veterans educational benefits; and ensure that educational 
institutions provide high-quality academic and student support services 
to active-duty service members, reservists, members of the National 
Guard, veterans, and military families.
To the extent permitted by law, the Principles, implemented pursuant to 
section 3 of this order, should require educational institutions 
receiving funding pursuant to Federal military and veterans educational 
benefits to:
    (a) prior to enrollment, provide prospective students who are 
eligible to receive Federal military and veterans educational benefits 
with a personalized and standardized form, as developed in a manner set 
forth by the Secretary of Education, working with the Secretaries of 
Defense and Veterans Affairs, to help those prospective students 
understand the total cost of the educational program, including tuition 
and fees; the amount of that cost that will be covered by Federal 
educational benefits; the type and amount of financial aid they may 
qualify for; their estimated student loan debt upon graduation; 
information about student outcomes; and other information to facilitate 
comparison of aid packages offered by different educational 
institutions;
    (b) inform students who are eligible to receive Federal military and 
veterans educational benefits of the availability of Federal financial 
aid and have in place policies to alert those students of their 
potential eligibility for that aid before packaging or arranging private 
student loans or alternative financing programs;
    (c) end fraudulent and unduly aggressive recruiting techniques on 
and off military installations, as well as misrepresentation, payment of 
incentive compensation, and failure to meet State authorization 
requirements, consistent with the regulations issued by the Department 
of Education (34 C.F.R. 668.71-668.75, 668.14, and 600.9);
    (d) obtain the approval of the institution's accrediting agency for 
new course or program offerings before enrolling students in such 
courses or programs, provided that such approval is appropriate under 
the substantive change requirements of the accrediting agency;
    (e) allow service members and reservists to be readmitted to a 
program if they are temporarily unable to attend class or have to 
suspend their studies due to service requirements, and take additional 
steps to accommodate short absences due to service obligations, provided 
that satisfactory academic progress is being made by the service members 
and reservists prior to suspending their studies;
    (f) agree to an institutional refund policy that is aligned with the 
refund of unearned student aid rules applicable to Federal student aid 
provided through the Department of Education under Title IV of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965, as required under section 484B of that Act 
when students withdraw prior to course completion;
    (g) provide educational plans for all individuals using Federal 
military and veterans educational benefits that detail how they will 
fulfill all the requirements necessary to graduate and the expected 
timeline of completion; and

[[Page 250]]

    (h) designate a point of contact for academic and financial advising 
(including access to disability counseling) to assist service member and 
veteran students and their families with the successful completion of 
their studies and with their job searches.
Sec. 3. Implementation of the Principles of Excellence.
    (a) The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs shall reflect 
the Principles described in section 2 of this order in new agreements 
with educational institutions, to the extent practicable and permitted 
by law, concerning participation in the Yellow Ribbon Program for 
veterans under the Post-9/11 GI Bill or the Tuition Assistance Program 
for active duty service members. The Department of Veterans Affairs 
shall also notify all institutions participating in the Post-9/11 GI 
Bill program that they are strongly encouraged to comply with the 
Principles and shall post on the Department's website those that do.
    (b) The Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education, in 
consultation with the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
Protection (CFPB) and the Attorney General, shall take immediate action 
to implement this order, and, within 90 days from the date of this 
order, report to the President their progress on implementation, 
including promptly revising regulations, Department of Defense 
Instructions, guidance documents, Memoranda of Understanding, and other 
policies governing programs authorized or funded by the Post-9/11 GI 
Bill and the Tuition Assistance Program to implement the Principles, to 
the extent permitted by law.
    (c) The Secretaries of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education 
shall develop a comprehensive strategy for developing service member and 
veteran student outcome measures that are comparable, to the maximum 
extent practicable, across Federal military and veterans educational 
benefit programs, including, but not limited to, the Post-9/11 GI Bill 
and the Tuition Assistance Program. To the extent practicable, the 
student outcome measures should rely on existing administrative data to 
minimize the reporting burden on institutions participating in these 
benefit programs. The student outcome measures should permit comparisons 
across Federal educational programs and across institutions and types of 
institutions. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the 
Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs, shall also collect from 
educational institutions, as part of the Integrated Postsecondary 
Education Data System and other data collection systems, information on 
the amount of funding received pursuant to the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the 
Tuition Assistance Program. The Secretary of Education shall make this 
information publicly available on the College Navigator Website.
    (d) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the 
Secretaries of Defense and Education, shall provide to prospective 
military and veteran students, prior to using their benefits, 
streamlined tools to compare educational institutions using key measures 
of affordability and value through the Department of Veterans Affairs' 
eBenefits portal. The eBenefits portal shall be updated to facilitate 
access to school performance information, consumer protection 
information, and key Federal financial aid documents. The Secretaries of 
Defense and Veterans Affairs shall also ensure that service members and 
veterans have access to that information through educational counseling 
offered by those Departments.

[[Page 251]]

Sec. 4. Strengthening Enforcement and Compliance Mechanisms. Service 
members, veterans, spouses, and other family members should have access 
to a strong enforcement system through which to file complaints when 
institutions fail to follow the Principles. Within 90 days of the date 
of this order, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Director of the 
CFPB, as well as with the Attorney General, as appropriate, shall submit 
to the President a plan to strengthen enforcement and compliance 
mechanisms. The plan shall include proposals to:
    (a) create a centralized complaint system for students receiving 
Federal military and veterans educational benefits to register 
complaints that can be tracked and responded to by the Departments of 
Defense, Veterans Affairs, Justice, and Education, the CFPB, and other 
relevant agencies;
    (b) institute uniform procedures for receiving and processing 
complaints across the State Approving Agencies (SAAs) that work with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to review participating institutions, 
provide a coordinated mechanism across SAAs to alert the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to any complaints that have been registered at the 
State level, and create procedures for sharing information about 
complaints with the appropriate State officials, accrediting agency 
representatives, and the Secretary of Education;
    (c) institute uniform procedures for referring potential matters for 
civil or criminal enforcement to the Department of Justice and other 
relevant agencies;
    (d) establish procedures for targeted risk-based program reviews of 
institutions to ensure compliance with the Principles;
    (e) establish new uniform rules and strengthen existing procedures 
for access to military installations by educational institutions. These 
new rules should ensure, at a minimum, that only those institutions that 
enter into a memorandum of agreement pursuant to section 3(a) of this 
order are permitted entry onto a Federal military installation for the 
purposes of recruitment. The Department of Defense shall include 
specific steps for instructing installation commanders on commercial 
solicitation rules and the requirement of the Principles outlined in 
section 2(c) of this order; and
    (f) take all appropriate steps to ensure that websites and programs 
are not deceptively and fraudulently marketing educational services and 
benefits to program beneficiaries, including initiating a process to 
protect the term ``GI Bill'' and other military or veterans-related 
terms as trademarks, as appropriate.
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented 
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of 
appropriations.
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party

against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its

Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012

Prohibiting Certain Transactions With and Suspending Entry Into the 
United States of Foreign Sanctions Evaders With Respect to Iran and 
Syria

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the

and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, hereby find 
that efforts by foreign persons to engage in activities intended to 
evade U.S. economic and financial sanctions with respect to Iran and 
Syria undermine our efforts to address the national emergencies declared 
in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, as relied on for additional 
steps in subsequent Executive Orders, in Executive Order 13338 of May 
11, 2004, as modified in scope and relied on for additional steps in

or any Executive Order relating to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001;

[[Page 253]]

(ii) has facilitated deceptive transactions for or on behalf of any person 
subject to United States sanctions concerning Iran or Syria; or

to United States persons, wherever located.
    (c) The prohibitions in subsection (b) of this section apply except 
to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the date of this order.
Sec. 2. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person subject to the measures 
described in section 1 of this order would seriously impair my ability 
to deal with the national emergencies identified in the preamble to this 
order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of 
this order.
Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not 
limited to:
    (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person subject to the

the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to 
the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend the entry into 
the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such 
persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 
8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United

Economic Powers Act Sanctions).
Sec. 5. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the

    (d) the term ``deceptive transaction'' means any transaction where 
the identity of any person subject to United States sanctions concerning

Order 13338 of May 11, 2004, as modified in scope in subsequent 
Executive Orders, or (ii) any person whose property and interests in

Executive Order 13609 of May 1, 2012

Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote 
international regulatory cooperation, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011 (Improving 
Regulation and Regulatory Review), states that our regulatory system 
must protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment while 
promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job 
creation. In an increasingly global economy, international regulatory 
cooperation, consistent with domestic law and prerogatives and U.S. 
trade policy, can be an important means of promoting the goals of 
Executive Order 13563.
The regulatory approaches taken by foreign governments may differ from 
those taken by U.S. regulatory agencies to address similar issues. In 
some cases, the differences between the regulatory approaches of U.S. 
agencies and those of their foreign counterparts might not be necessary 
and might impair the ability of American businesses to export and 
compete internationally. In meeting shared challenges involving health, 
safety, labor, security, environmental, and other issues, international 
regulatory cooperation can identify approaches that are at least as 
protective as those that are or would be adopted in the absence of such 
cooperation. International regulatory cooperation can also reduce, 
eliminate, or prevent unnecessary differences in regulatory 
requirements.
Sec. 2. Coordination of International Regulatory Cooperation. (a) The 
Regulatory Working Group (Working Group) established by Executive Order 
12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), which was 
reaffirmed by Executive Order 13563, shall, as appropriate:

(i) serve as a forum to discuss, coordinate, and develop a common 
understanding among agencies of U.S. Government positions and priorities 
with respect to:

  (A) international regulatory cooperation activities that are reasonably 
anticipated to lead to significant regulatory actions;

  (B) efforts across the Federal Government to support significant, cross-
cutting international regulatory cooperation activities, such as the work 
of regulatory cooperation councils; and

  (C) the promotion of good regulatory practices internationally, as well 
as the promotion of U.S. regulatory approaches, as appropriate; and

[[Page 256]]

(ii) examine, among other things:

  (A) appropriate strategies for engaging in the development of regulatory 
approaches through international regulatory cooperation, particularly in 
emerging technology areas, when consistent with section 1 of this order;

  (B) best practices for international regulatory cooperation with respect 
to regulatory development, and, where appropriate, information exchange and 
other regulatory tools; and

  (C) factors that agencies should take into account when determining 
whether and how to consider other regulatory approaches under section 3(d) 
of this order.

    (b) As Chair of the Working Group, the Administrator of the Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) shall convene the Working Group as necessary to discuss 
international regulatory cooperation issues as described above, and the 
Working Group shall include a representative from the Office of the 
United States Trade Representative and, as appropriate, representatives 
from other agencies and offices.
    (c) The activities of the Working Group, consistent with law, shall 
not duplicate the efforts of existing interagency bodies and 
coordination mechanisms. The Working Group shall consult with existing 
interagency bodies when appropriate.
    (d) To inform its discussions, and pursuant to section 4 of 
Executive Order 12866, the Working Group may commission analytical 
reports and studies by OIRA, the Administrative Conference of the United 
States, or any other relevant agency, and the Administrator of OIRA may 
solicit input, from time to time, from representatives of business, 
nongovernmental organizations, and the public.
    (e) The Working Group shall develop and issue guidelines on the 
applicability and implementation of sections 2 through 4 of this order.
    (f) For purposes of this order, the Working Group shall operate by 
consensus.
Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Federal Agencies. To the extent permitted by 
law, and consistent with the principles and requirements of Executive 
Order 13563 and Executive Order 12866, each agency shall:
    (a) if required to submit a Regulatory Plan pursuant to Executive 
Order 12866, include in that plan a summary of its international 
regulatory cooperation activities that are reasonably anticipated to 
lead to significant regulations, with an explanation of how these 
activities advance the purposes of Executive Order 13563 and this order;
    (b) ensure that significant regulations that the agency identifies 
as having significant international impacts are designated as such in

Executive Order 13610 of May 10, 2012

Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to modernize our 
regulatory system and to reduce unjustified regulatory burdens and 
costs, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Regulations play an indispensable role in protecting 
public health, welfare, safety, and our environment, but they can also 
impose significant burdens and costs. During challenging economic times, 
we should be especially careful not to impose unjustified regulatory 
requirements. For this reason, it is particularly important for agencies 
to conduct retrospective analyses of existing rules to examine whether 
they remain justified and whether they should be modified or streamlined 
in light of changed circumstances, including the rise of new 
technologies.
Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review), states that our regulatory system ``must measure, 
and seek to improve, the actual results of regulatory requirements.'' To 
promote this goal, that Executive Order requires agencies not merely to 
conduct a single exercise, but to engage in ``periodic review of 
existing significant regulations.'' Pursuant to section 6(b) of that 
Executive Order, agencies are required to develop retrospective review 
plans to review existing significant regulations in order to ``determine 
whether any such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, 
or repealed.'' The purpose of this requirement is to ``make the agency's 
regulatory program more effective or less burdensome in achieving the 
regulatory objectives.''
In response to Executive Order 13563, agencies have developed and made 
available for public comment retrospective review plans that identify 
over five hundred initiatives. A small fraction of those initiatives, 
already finalized or formally proposed to the public, are anticipated to 
eliminate billions of dollars in regulatory costs and tens of millions 
of hours in annual paperwork burdens. Significantly larger savings are 
anticipated as the plans are implemented and as action is taken on 
additional initiatives.

[[Page 259]]

As a matter of longstanding practice and to satisfy statutory 
obligations, many agencies engaged in periodic review of existing 
regulations prior to the issuance of Executive Order 13563. But further 
steps should be taken, consistent with law, agency resources, and 
regulatory priorities, to promote public participation in retrospective 
review, to modernize our regulatory system, and to institutionalize 
regular assessment of significant regulations.
Sec. 2. Public Participation in Retrospective Review. Members of the 
public, including those directly and indirectly affected by regulations, 
as well as State, local, and tribal governments, have important 
information about the actual effects of existing regulations. For this 
reason, and consistent with Executive Order 13563, agencies shall 
invite, on a regular basis (to be determined by the agency head in 
consultation with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA)), public suggestions about regulations in need of retrospective 
review and about appropriate modifications to such regulations. To 
promote an open exchange of information, retrospective analyses of 
regulations, including supporting data, shall be released to the public 
online wherever practicable.
Sec. 3. Setting Priorities. In implementing and improving their 
retrospective review plans, and in considering retrospective review 
suggestions from the public, agencies shall give priority, consistent 
with law, to those initiatives that will produce significant 
quantifiable monetary savings or significant quantifiable reductions in 
paperwork burdens while protecting public health, welfare, safety, and 
our environment. To the extent practicable and permitted by law, 
agencies shall also give special consideration to initiatives that would 
reduce unjustified regulatory burdens or simplify or harmonize 
regulatory requirements imposed on small businesses. Consistent with 
Executive Order 13563 and Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 
(Regulatory Planning and Review), agencies shall give consideration to 
the cumulative effects of their own regulations, including cumulative 
burdens, and shall to the extent practicable and consistent with law 
give priority to reforms that would make significant progress in 
reducing those burdens while protecting public health, welfare, safety, 
and our environment.
Sec. 4. Accountability. Agencies shall regularly report on the status of 
their retrospective review efforts to OIRA. Agency reports should 
describe progress, anticipated accomplishments, and proposed timelines 
for relevant actions, with an emphasis on the priorities described in 
section 3 of this order. Agencies shall submit draft reports to OIRA on 
September 10, 2012, and on the second Monday of January and July for 
each year thereafter, unless directed otherwise through subsequent 
guidance from OIRA. Agencies shall make final reports available to the 
public within a reasonable period (not to exceed three weeks from the 
date of submission of draft reports to OIRA).
Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) For purposes of this order, ``agency'' 
means any authority of the United States that is an ``agency'' under 44 
U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be independent regulatory 
agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).
    (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

[[Page 260]]

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13611 of May 16, 2012

Blocking Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, or 
Stability of Yemen

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that 
the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Yemen 
and others threaten Yemen's peace, security, and stability, including by 
obstructing the implementation of the agreement of November 23, 2011, 
between the Government of Yemen and those in opposition to it, which 
provides for a peaceful transition of power that meets the legitimate 
demands and aspirations of the Yemeni people for change, and by 
obstructing the political process in Yemen. I further find that these 
actions constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a 
national emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby order:
Section 1. All property and interests in property that are in the United 
States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or 
hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any foreign branch, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to:
    (a) have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the 
peace, security, or stability of Yemen, such as acts that obstruct the 
implementation of the agreement of November 23, 2011, between the 
Government of Yemen and those in opposition to it, which provides for a 
peaceful transition of power in Yemen, or that obstruct the political 
process in Yemen;
    (b) be a political or military leader of an entity that has engaged 
in the acts described in subsection (a) of this section;

[[Page 261]]

    (c) have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in 
support of, the acts described in subsection (a) of this section or any 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
this order; or
    (d) be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.
Sec. 2. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously 
impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this 
order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of 
this order.
Sec. 3. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not 
limited to:
    (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and
    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.
Sec. 4. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order apply except to the 
extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or 
licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding 
any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the 
effective date of this order.
Sec. 5. Nothing in section 1 of this order shall prohibit transactions 
for the conduct of the official business of the United States Government 
by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof.
Sec. 6. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of 
evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any 
of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 7. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 8. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the

[[Page 262]]

national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice 
of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 9. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 11. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity 
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13616 of June 14, 2012

Accelerating Broadband Infrastructure Deployment

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, and in order to facilitate broadband deployment on 
Federal lands, buildings, and rights of way, federally assisted 
highways, and tribal and individual Indian trust lands (tribal lands), 
particularly in underserved communities, it is hereby ordered as 
follows:
Section 1. Policy. Broadband access is essential to the Nation's global 
competitiveness in the 21st century, driving job creation, promoting 
innovation, and expanding markets for American businesses. Broadband 
access also affords public safety agencies the opportunity for greater 
levels of effectiveness and interoperability. While broadband 
infrastructure has been deployed in a vast majority of communities 
across the country, today too many areas still lack adequate access to 
this crucial resource. For these areas, decisions on access to Federal 
property and rights of way can be essential to the deployment of both 
wired and wireless broadband infrastructure. The Federal Government 
controls nearly 30 percent of all land in the

[[Page 268]]

United States, owns thousands of buildings, and provides substantial 
funding for State and local transportation infrastructure, creating 
significant opportunities for executive departments and agencies 
(agencies) to help expand broadband infrastructure.
Sec. 2. Broadband Deployment on Federal Property Working Group. (a) In 
order to ensure a coordinated and consistent approach in implementing

(i) develop and implement a strategy to facilitate the timely and efficient 
deployment of broadband facilities on Federal lands, buildings, and rights 
of way, federally assisted highways, and tribal lands, that:

(1) ensures a consistent approach across the Federal Government that 
facilitates broadband deployment processes and decisions, including by: 
avoiding duplicative reviews; coordinating review processes; providing 
clear notice of all application and other requirements; ensuring consistent 
interpretation and application of all procedures, requirements, and 
policies; supporting decisions on deployment of broadband service to those 
living on tribal lands consistent with existing statutes, treaties, and 
trust responsibilities; and ensuring the public availability of current 
information on these matters;

(2) where beneficial and appropriate, includes procedures for coordination 
with State, local, and tribal governments, and other appropriate entities;

(3) is coordinated with appropriate external stakeholders, as determined by 
each Broadband Member Agency, prior to implementation; and

in order to reflect changes in broadband technologies and markets and to 
promote competitive broadband infrastructure deployment; and

(v) the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the Working 
Group and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation 
Officials, shall create an online platform that States and counties may use 
to aggregate and make publicly available their rights of way laws and joint 
occupancy guidelines and agreements.

(b) For the purposes of this section, the term ``dig once requirements'' 
means requirements designed to reduce the number and scale of repeated 
excavations for the installation and maintenance of broadband facilities 
in rights of way.

Executive Order 13617 of June 25, 2012

Blocking Property of the Government of the Russian Federation Relating 
to the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted From Nuclear 
Weapons

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, in view of 
the policies underlying Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994, and 
Executive Order 13085 of May 26, 1998, and the restrictions put in place 
pursuant to Executive Order 13159 of June 21, 2000, find that the risk 
of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of a large volume 
of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian 
Federation continues to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and 
hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby 
order:
Section 1. A major national security goal of the United States is to 
ensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons 
pursuant to various arms control and disarmament agreements is dedicated 
to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and protected from 
diversion to activities of proliferation concern. As reflected in 
Executive Order 13085, the full implementation of the Agreement Between 
the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Russian Federation Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium 
Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related 
contracts and

[[Page 272]]

agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements'') is essential to the 
attainment of this goal. The HEU Agreements provide for the conversion 
of approximately 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium contained in 
Russian nuclear weapons into low-enriched uranium for use as fuel in 
commercial nuclear reactors. In furtherance of our national security 
goals, all heads of departments and agencies of the United States 
Government shall continue to take all appropriate measures within their 
authority to further the full implementation of the HEU Agreements.
Sec. 2. Government of the Russian Federation assets directly related to 
the implementation of the HEU Agreements currently may be subject to 
attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other 
judicial process, thereby jeopardizing the full implementation of the 
HEU Agreements to the detriment of U.S. foreign policy. In order to 
ensure the preservation and proper and complete transfer to the 
Government of the Russian Federation of all payments due to it under the 
HEU Agreements, and except to the extent provided in regulations, 
orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this 
order, or that were issued pursuant to Executive Order 13159 of June 21, 
2000, all property and interests in property of the Government of the 
Russian Federation directly related to the implementation of the HEU 
Agreements that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the 
United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or 
control of any United States persons, including any foreign branch, are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in. Unless licensed or authorized pursuant to this 
order, or Executive Order 13159 of June 21, 2000, any attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process is null and void with respect to any property or interest in 
property blocked pursuant to this order.
Sec. 3. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of 
evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any 
of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 4. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States; and
    (d) the term ``Government of the Russian Federation'' means the 
Government of the Russian Federation, any political subdivision, agency, 
or instrumentality thereof, and any person owned or controlled by, or 
acting for or on behalf of, the Government of the Russian Federation.
Sec. 5. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and, as appropriate, other 
agencies, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the 
promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted 
to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes 
of this order. The

[[Page 273]]

Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other 
officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with 
applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government are hereby 
directed to take all appropriate measures within their statutory 
authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
    (b) Nothing contained in this order shall relieve a person from any 
requirement to obtain a license or other authorization from any 
department or agency of the United States Government in compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations subject to the jurisdiction of the 
department or agency.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 7. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, hereby 
modify the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13047 of May 20, 1997, as modified in scope in Executive Order 13448 of 
October 18, 2007, and relied upon for additional steps taken in 
Executive Order 13310 of July 28, 2003, Executive Order 13448 of October 
18, 2007, and Executive Order 13464 of April 30, 2008. The Government of 
Burma has made progress towards political reform in a number of areas, 
including by releasing hundreds of political prisoners, pursuing 
ceasefire talks with several armed ethnic groups, and pursuing a 
substantive dialogue with the democratic opposition. Recognizing that 
such reform is fragile, I hereby find that the continued detention of 
political prisoners, efforts to undermine or obstruct the political 
reform process, efforts to undermine or obstruct the peace process with 
ethnic minorities, military trade with North Korea, and human rights 
abuses in Burma particularly in ethnic areas, effectuated by persons 
within or outside the Government of Burma, constitute an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States. Accordingly, I hereby order:
Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are 
or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States 
person, including any foreign branch, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in: any person determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with or at the recommendation of the Secretary 
of State:

(i) to have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, 
security, or stability of Burma, such as actions that have the purpose or 
effect of undermining or obstructing the political reform process or the 
peace process with ethnic minorities in Burma;

(ii) to be responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, 
controlling, or otherwise directing, or to have participated in, the 
commission of human rights abuses in Burma;

(iii) to have, directly or indirectly, imported, exported, reexported, sold 
or supplied arms or related materiel from North Korea or the Government of 
North Korea to Burma or the Government of Burma;

(iv) to be a senior official of an entity that has engaged in the acts 
described in subsection (a)(i)-(iii) of this section;

(v) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in 
support

[[Page 280]]

of, the acts described in subsection (a)(i)-(iii) of this section or any 
person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
this order; or

(vi) to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for 
or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and 
interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

    (b) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except 
to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the effective date of this order.
Sec. 2. I hereby amend: (a) Executive Order 13464 of April 30, 2008, by 
removing ``logistical, or technical'' in section 1(b)(ii) and replacing 
it with ``or technological''; and
    (b) Executive Order 13448 of October 18, 2007, by removing 
``logistical, or technical'' in section 1(b)(iv) and replacing it with 
``or technological.''
Sec. 3. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order would seriously 
impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13047, as modified in scope in Executive Order 13448 and 
in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by 
section 1 of this order.
Sec. 4. The prohibitions in section 1 of this order include but are not 
limited to: (a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, 
goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; 
and
    (b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or 
services from any such person.
Sec. 5. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant 
entry into the United States of aliens determined to meet one or more of 
the criteria in subsection 1(a) of this order would be detrimental to 
the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the 
United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. Such 
persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of Proclamation 
8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens Subject to United 
Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act Sanctions).
Sec. 6. Nothing in section 1 of this order, section 1 of Executive Order 
13464 of April 30, 2008, section 1 of Executive Order 13448 of October 
18, 2007, sections 1 through 3 of Executive Order 13310 of July 28, 
2003, or sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13047 shall prohibit 
transactions for the conduct of the official business of the United 
States Government by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof, except 
to the extent that engaging in such transactions would require the 
issuance of a statutory waiver and such a waiver is not issued.
Sec. 7. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of 
evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any 
of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.

[[Page 281]]

    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 8. For the purposes of this order: (a) the term ``person'' means an 
individual or entity;
    (b) The term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 9. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13047, as modified in scope in Executive Order 13448 and in this 
order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made 
pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 10. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 11. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity 
by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13621 of July 26, 2012

White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, to restore the country to its role 
as the global leader in education, to strengthen the Nation by improving 
educational outcomes for African Americans of all ages, and to help 
ensure that all African Americans receive an education that properly 
prepares them for college, productive careers, and satisfying lives, it 
is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Over the course of America's history, African 
American men and women have strengthened our Nation, including by 
leading reforms, overcoming obstacles, and breaking down barriers. In 
the less than 60 years since the Brown v. Board of Education decision 
put America on a path toward equal educational opportunity, America's 
educational system has undergone a remarkable transformation, and many 
African American children who attended the substandard segregated 
schools of the 1950s have grown up to see their children attend 
integrated elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities.
However, substantial obstacles to equal educational opportunity still 
remain in America's educational system. African Americans lack equal 
access to highly effective teachers and principals, safe schools, and 
challenging college-preparatory classes, and they disproportionately 
experience school discipline and referrals to special education. African 
American student achievement not only lags behind that of their domestic 
peers by an average of two grade levels, but also behind students in 
almost every other developed nation. Over a third of African American 
students do not graduate from high school on time with a regular high 
school diploma, and only four percent of African American high school 
graduates interested in college are college-ready across a range of 
subjects. An even greater number of African American males do not 
graduate with a regular high school diploma, and African American males 
also experience disparate rates of incarceration.
Significantly improving the educational outcomes of African Americans 
will provide substantial benefits for our country by, among other 
things, increasing college completion rates, productivity, employment 
rates, and the number of African American teachers. Enhanced educational 
outcomes lead to more productive careers, improved economic opportunity, 
and greater social well-being for all Americans. Complementing the role 
of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in preparing 
generations of African American students for successful careers, and the 
work of my Administration's separate White House Initiative on 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, this new Initiative's 
focus on improving all the sequential levels of education will produce a 
more effective educational continuum for all African American students.
To reach the ambitious education goals we have set for our Nation, as 
well as to ensure equality of access and opportunity for all, we must 
provide the support that will enable African American students to 
improve their

[[Page 285]]

level of educational achievement through rigorous and well-rounded 
academic and support services that will prepare them for college, a 
career, and a lifetime of learning.
Sec. 2. White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African 
Americans. (a) Establishment. There is hereby established the White 
House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans 
(Initiative), to be housed in the Department of Education (Department). 
There shall be an Executive Director of the Initiative, to be appointed 
by the Secretary of Education (Secretary). The Initiative shall be 
supported by the Interagency Working Group established under subsection 
(c) of this section and advised by the Commission established under 
section 3 of this order.
    (b) Mission and Functions.

(1) The Initiative will help to restore the United States to its role as 
the global leader in education; strengthen the Nation by improving 
educational outcomes for African Americans of all ages; and help ensure 
that African Americans receive a complete and competitive education that 
prepares them for college, a satisfying career, and productive citizenship.

(2) The Initiative will complement and reinforce the Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities Initiative established by Executive Order 13532 
of February 26, 2010, and together, they both will support enhanced 
educational outcomes for African Americans at every level of the American 
education system, including early childhood education; elementary, 
secondary, and postsecondary education; career and technical education; and 
adult education.

(3) To help expand educational opportunities, improve educational outcomes, 
and deliver a complete and competitive education for all African Americans, 
the Initiative shall, consistent with applicable law, promote, encourage, 
and undertake efforts designed to meet the following objectives:

    (i) increasing general understanding of the causes of the 
educational challenges faced by African American students, whether 
they are in urban, suburban, or rural learning environments;
    (ii) increasing the percentage of African American children 
who enter kindergarten ready for success by improving their access 
to high-quality programs and services that enable early learning 
and development of children from birth through age 5;
    (iii) decreasing the disproportionate number of referrals of 
African American children from general education to special 
education by addressing the root causes of the referrals and 
eradicating discriminatory referrals;
    (iv) implementing successful and innovative education reform 
strategies and practices in America's public schools to ensure 
that African American students receive a rigorous and well-rounded 
education in safe and healthy environments, and have access to 
high-level, rigorous course work and support services that will 
prepare them for college, a career, and civic participation;

[[Page 286]]

    (v) ensuring that all African American students have 
comparable access to the resources necessary to obtain a high-
quality education, including effective teachers and school 
leaders, in part by supporting efforts to improve the recruitment, 
preparation, development, and retention of successful African 
American teachers and school leaders and other effective teachers 
and school leaders responsible for the education of African 
American students;
    (vi) reducing the dropout rate of African American students 
and helping African American students graduate from high school 
prepared for college and a career, in part by promoting a positive 
school climate that does not rely on methods that result in 
disparate use of disciplinary tools, and by supporting successful 
and innovative dropout prevention and recovery strategies that 
better engage African American youths in their learning, help them 
catch up academically, and provide those who have left the 
educational system with pathways to reentry;
    (vii) increasing college access and success for African 
American students and providing support to help ensure that a 
greater percentage of African Americans complete college and 
contribute to the goal of having America again lead the world in 
the proportion of adults who are college graduates by 2020, in 
part through strategies to strengthen the capacity of institutions 
of higher education that serve large numbers of African American 
students, including community colleges, HBCUs, Predominantly Black 
Institutions (PBIs), and other institutions; and
    (viii) enhancing the educational and life opportunities of 
African Americans by fostering positive family and community 
engagement in education; reducing racial isolation and 
resegregation of elementary and secondary schools to promote 
understanding and tolerance among all Americans; improving the 
quality of, and expanding access to, adult education, literacy, 
and career and technical education; and increasing opportunities 
for education and career advancement in the fields of science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics.

(4) In working to fulfill its mission and objectives, the Initiative shall, 
consistent with applicable law:

    (i) identify evidence-based best practices that can provide 
African American students a rigorous and well-rounded education in 
safe and healthy environments, as well as access to support 
services, which will prepare them for college, a career, and civic 
participation;
    (ii) develop a national network of individuals, organizations, 
and communities to share and implement best practices related to 
the education of African Americans, including those identified as 
most at risk;
    (iii) help ensure that Federal programs and initiatives 
administered by the Department and other agencies are serving and 
meeting the educational needs of African Americans, including by 
encouraging agencies to incorporate best practices into 
appropriate discretionary programs where permitted by law;
    (iv) work closely with the Executive Office of the President 
on key Administration priorities related to the education of 
African Americans;

[[Page 287]]

    (v) increase the participation of the African American 
community, including institutions that serve that community, in 
the Department's programs and in education-related programs at 
other agencies;
    (vi) advise the officials of the Department and other agencies 
on issues related to the educational attainment of African 
Americans;
    (vii) advise the Secretary on the development, implementation, 
and coordination of educational programs and initiatives at the 
Department and other agencies that are designed to improve 
educational opportunities and outcomes for African Americans of 
all ages; and
    (viii) encourage and develop partnerships with public, 
private, philanthropic, and nonprofit stakeholders to improve 
African Americans' readiness for school, college, and career, as 
well as their college persistence and completion.

(5) The Initiative shall periodically publish reports on its activities. 
The Secretary and the Executive Director of the Initiative, in consultation 
with the Working Group and the Chair of the Commission established under 
subsection (c) of this section and section 3 of this order, respectively, 
may develop and submit to the President recommendations designed to advance 
and promote educational opportunities and attainment for African Americans.

    (c) Interagency Working Group.

(1) There is established the Federal Interagency Working Group on 
Educational Excellence for African Americans (Working Group), which shall 
be convened and chaired by the Initiative's Executive Director and that 
shall support the efforts of the Initiative described in subsection (b) of 
this section.

(2) The Working Group shall consist of senior officials from the 
Department, the White House Domestic Policy Council, the Department of 
Justice, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human 
Services, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and 
such additional agencies and offices as the President may subsequently 
designate. Senior officials shall be designated by the heads of their 
respective agencies and offices.

(3) The Initiative's Executive Director may establish subgroups of the 
Working Group to focus on different aspects of the educational system (such 
as early childhood education, K-12 education, higher education (including 
HBCUs and PBIs), career and technical education, adult education, or 
correctional education and reengagement) or educational challenges facing 
particular populations of African Americans (such as young men, 
disconnected or out-of-school youth, individuals with disabilities, 
children identified as gifted and talented, single-parent households, or 
adults already in the workforce).

    (d) Administration. The Department shall provide funding and 
administrative support for the Initiative and the Working Group, to the 
extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. To the 
extent permitted by law, other agencies and offices represented on the 
Working Group may detail personnel to the Initiative, to assist the 
Department in meeting the objectives of this order.
    (e) Collaboration Among White House Initiatives. The Initiative may 
collaborate with the White House Initiatives on American Indian and 
Alaska

[[Page 288]]

Native Education, Educational Excellence for Hispanics, Asian-American 
and Pacific Islanders, and (consistent with section 3(c) of this order)

Sec. 3.  President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for 
African Americans. (a) Establishment. There is established in the

reporting to the Congress, shall be performed by the Secretary, in 
accordance with the guidelines issued by the Administrator of General 
Services.

head thereof; or

(2) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code,
I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, in order to 
take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, as relied upon for additional 
steps in subsequent Executive Orders, particularly in light of the 
Government of Iran's use of revenues from petroleum, petroleum products, 
and petrochemicals for illicit purposes, Iran's continued attempts to 
evade international sanctions through deceptive practices, and the 
unacceptable risk posed to the international financial system by Iran's 
activities, hereby order:
Section 1. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to impose on a foreign 
financial institution the sanctions described in subsection (b) of this 
section upon determining that the foreign financial institution has 
knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant financial 
transaction:

(i) with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) or Naftiran Intertrade 
Company (NICO), except for a sale or provision to NIOC or NICO of the 
products described in section 5(a)(3)(A)(i) of the Iran Sanctions Act of 
1996 (Public Law 104-172), as amended, provided that the fair market value

subsection 1245(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81) (NDAA) that there is a sufficient supply of 
petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to permit a 
significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products 
purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions; and

[[Page 291]]

(ii) an exception under subparagraph 4(D) of subsection 1245(d) of the NDAA 
from the imposition of sanctions under paragraph (1) of that subsection 
does not apply with respect to the country with primary jurisdiction over 
the foreign financial institution.

to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders,

other agencies and officials as appropriate, is hereby authorized to 
impose on a person any of the sanctions described in section 3 or 4 of 
this order upon determining that the person:

(i) knowingly, on or after the effective date of this order, engaged in a 
significant transaction for the purchase or acquisition of petroleum or 
petroleum products from Iran;

(ii) knowingly, on or after the effective date of this order, engaged in a 
significant transaction for the purchase or acquisition of petrochemical

    (b) With respect to any person determined by the Secretary of the

Sec. 11. For those persons whose property and interests in property are

funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to subsection (a)(iv) of section 4 or

actions of the Government of Iran occurring after the conclusion of the 
1981 Algiers Accords, and are intended solely as a response to those 
later actions.
Sec. 15. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
July 31, 2012.

Executive Order 13623 of August 10, 2012

Preventing and Responding to Violence Against Women and Girls Globally

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. (a) Recognizing that gender-based violence undermines 
not only the safety, dignity, and human rights of the millions of 
individuals who experience it, but also the public health, economic 
stability, and security of nations, it is the policy and practice of the 
executive branch of the United States Government to have a multi-year 
strategy that will more effectively prevent and respond to gender-based 
violence globally.
    (b) Under the leadership of my Administration, the United States has 
made gender equality and women's empowerment a core focus of our foreign 
policy. This focus is reflected in our National Security Strategy, the 
Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, and the 2010 U.S. 
Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. Evidence demonstrates that 
women's empowerment is critical to building stable, democratic 
societies; to supporting open and accountable governance; to furthering 
international peace and security; to growing vibrant market economies; 
and to addressing pressing health and education challenges.

[[Page 297]]

    (c) Preventing and responding to gender-based violence is a 
cornerstone of my Administration's commitment to advance gender equality 
and women's empowerment. Such violence significantly hinders the ability 
of individuals to fully participate in, and contribute to, their 
communities--economically, politically, and socially. It is a human 
rights violation or abuse; a public health challenge; and a barrier to 
civic, social, political, and economic participation. It is associated 
with adverse health outcomes, limited access to education, increased 
costs relating to medical and legal services, lost household 
productivity, and reduced income, and there is evidence it is 
exacerbated in times of crisis, such as emergencies, natural disasters, 
and violent conflicts.
    (d) The executive branch multi-year strategy for preventing and 
responding to gender-based violence is set forth in the United States 
Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-based Violence Globally 
(Strategy). The Strategy both responds to and expands upon the request 
in section 7061 of House conference report 112-331 accompanying the 
Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs 
Appropriations Act, 2012 (Division I of Public Law 112-74), for the 
executive branch to develop a multi-year strategy to prevent and respond 
to violence against women and girls in countries where it is common.
Sec. 2. Creating an Interagency Working Group. There is established an 
Interagency Working Group (Working Group) to address gender-based 
violence, which shall coordinate implementation of the Strategy by the 
executive departments and agencies that are members of the Working Group 
(member agencies) in accordance with the priorities set forth in section 
3 of this order.
    (a) The Working Group shall be co-chaired by the Secretary of State 
and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International 
Development (Co-Chairs). In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Working Group 
shall consist of representatives from:
    (i) the Department of the Treasury;
    (ii) the Department of Defense;
    (iii) the Department of Justice;
    (iv) the Department of Labor;
    (v) the Department of Health and Human Services;
    (vi) the Department of Homeland Security;
    (vii) the Office of Management and Budget;
    (viii) the National Security Staff;
    (ix) the Office of the Vice President;
    (x) the Peace Corps;
    (xi) the Millennium Challenge Corporation;
    (xii) the White House Council on Women and Girls; and
    (xiii) other executive departments, agencies, and offices, as 
designated by the Co-Chairs.
    (b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Co-Chairs shall 
convene the first meeting of the Working Group to:
    (i) establish benchmarks to implement the Strategy; and
    (ii) determine a timetable for periodically reviewing those 
benchmarks.

[[Page 298]]

    (c) Within 18 months of the date of this order, the Working Group 
shall complete a progress report for submission to the Co-Chairs 
evaluating the U.S. Government's implementation of the Strategy.
    (d) Within 3 years of the date of this order, the Working Group 
shall complete a final evaluation for submission to the Co-Chairs of the 
U.S. Government's implementation of the Strategy.
    (e) Within 180 days of completing its final evaluation of the 
Strategy in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, the Working 
Group shall update or revise the Strategy to take into account the 
information learned and the progress made during and through the 
implementation of the Strategy.
    (f) The activities of the Working Group shall, consistent with law, 
take due account of existing interagency bodies and coordination 
mechanisms and will coordinate with such bodies and mechanisms where 
appropriate in order to avoid duplication of efforts.
Sec. 3. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-based Violence 
Globally. Member agencies shall implement the Strategy to prevent and 
respond to gender-based violence globally based on the following 
priorities reflected in the Strategy:
    (a) Increasing Coordination of Gender-based Violence Prevention and 
Response Efforts Among U.S. Government Agencies and with Other 
Stakeholders.
    (i) Member agencies shall draw upon each other's expertise, 
responsibility, and capacity to provide a comprehensive and multi-
faceted approach to issues relating to gender-based violence.
    (ii) Member agencies shall deepen engagement and coordination 
with other governments; international organizations, including 
multilateral and bilateral actors; the private sector; and civil 
society organizations, such as representatives of indigenous and 
marginalized groups, foundations, community-based, faith-based, 
and regional organizations (including those that serve survivors), 
labor unions, universities, and research organizations. The 
Working Group shall consider a range of mechanisms by which these 
stakeholders may provide input to the U.S. Government on its role 
in preventing and responding to gender-based violence globally.
    (b) Enhancing Integration of Gender-based Violence Prevention and 
Response Efforts into Existing U.S. Government Work. Member agencies 
shall more comprehensively integrate gender-based violence prevention 
and response programming into their foreign policy and foreign 
assistance efforts. This integration shall also build on current efforts 
that address gender-based violence, such as the U.S. National Action 
Plan on Women, Peace, and Security; the Global Health Initiative; the 
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief; the U.S. Government's work 
to counter trafficking in persons; and the U.S. Government's 
humanitarian response efforts. The Working Group shall coordinate these 
different efforts as they relate to gender-based violence to leverage 
the most effective programs and to avoid duplication.
    (c) Improving Collection, Analysis, and Use of Data and Research to 
Enhance Gender-based Violence Prevention and Response Efforts. Member 
agencies shall work to promote ethical and safe research, data 
collection,

[[Page 299]]

and evidence-based analyses relating to different forms of gender-based 
violence and prevention and response efforts at the country and local 
level. This work will include the development of a research agenda that 
assesses agencies' research and data collection capabilities, needs, and 
gaps; builds upon existing data and research; and is coordinated with 
the work of other organizations that are prioritizing global gender-
based violence research. Member agencies shall prioritize the monitoring 
and evaluation of gender-based violence prevention and response 
interventions to determine their effectiveness. Member agencies shall 
systematically identify and share best practices, lessons learned, and 
research within and across agencies. Member agencies, as appropriate, 
shall seek to develop public-private partnerships to support U.S. 
Government research initiatives and strategic planning efforts.
    (d)  Enhancing or Expanding U.S. Government Programming that 
Addresses Gender-based Violence. Consistent with the availability of 
appropriations, the U.S. Government shall support programming that 
provides a comprehensive and multi-sector approach to preventing and 
responding to gender-based violence; shall consider replicating or 
expanding successful programs; and shall assess the feasibility of a 
focused, coordinated, comprehensive, and multi-sector approach to 
gender-based violence in one or more countries.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:
    (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, 
agency, or the head thereof; or
    (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative 
proposals.
    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with this 
order.
    (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13624 of August 30, 2012

Accelerating Investment in Industrial Energy Efficiency

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote American 
manufacturing by helping to facilitate investments in energy efficiency 
at industrial facilities, it is hereby ordered as follows:

[[Page 300]]

Section 1. Policy. The industrial sector accounts for over 30 percent of 
all energy consumed in the United States, and, for many manufacturers, 
energy costs affect overall competitiveness. While our manufacturing 
facilities have made progress in becoming more energy efficient over the 
past several decades, there is an opportunity to accelerate and expand 
these efforts with investments to reduce energy use through more 
efficient manufacturing processes and facilities and the expanded use of 
combined heat and power (CHP). Instead of burning fuel in an on-site 
boiler to produce thermal energy and also purchasing electricity from 
the grid, a manufacturing facility can use a CHP system to provide both 
types of energy in one energy-efficient step. Accelerating these 
investments in our Nation's factories can improve the competitiveness of 
United States manufacturing, lower energy costs, free up future capital 
for businesses to invest, reduce air pollution, and create jobs.
Despite these benefits, independent studies have pointed to under-
investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP as a result of 
numerous barriers. The Federal Government has limited but important 
authorities to overcome these barriers, and our efforts to support 
investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP should involve 
coordinated engagement with a broad set of stakeholders, including 
States, manufacturers, utilities, and others. By working with all 
stakeholders to address these barriers, we have an opportunity to save 
industrial users tens of billions of dollars in energy costs over the 
next decade.
There is no one-size-fits-all solution for our manufacturers, so it is 
imperative that we support these investments through a variety of 
approaches, including encouraging private sector investment by setting 
goals and highlighting the benefits of investment, improving 
coordination at the Federal level, partnering with and supporting 
States, and identifying investment models beneficial to the multiple 
stakeholders involved.
To formalize and support the close interagency coordination that is 
required to accelerate greater investment in industrial energy 
efficiency and CHP, this order directs certain executive departments and 
agencies to convene national and regional stakeholders to identify, 
develop, and encourage the adoption of investment models and State best 
practice policies for industrial energy efficiency and CHP; provide 
technical assistance to States and manufacturers to encourage investment 
in industrial energy efficiency and CHP; provide public information on 
the benefits of investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP; and 
use existing Federal authorities, programs, and policies to support 
investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP.
Sec. 2.  Encouraging Investment in Industrial Efficiency. The 
Departments of Energy, Commerce, and Agriculture, and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, in coordination with the National Economic Council, 
the Domestic Policy Council, the Council on Environmental Quality, and 
the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall coordinate policies 
to encourage investment in industrial efficiency in order to reduce 
costs for industrial users, improve U.S. competitiveness, create jobs, 
and reduce harmful air pollution. In doing so, they shall engage States, 
industrial companies, utility companies, and other stakeholders to 
accelerate this investment. Specifically, these agencies shall, as 
appropriate and consistent with applicable law:

[[Page 301]]

    (a) coordinate and strongly encourage efforts to achieve a national 
goal of deploying 40 gigawatts of new, cost-effective industrial CHP in 
the United States by the end of 2020;
    (b) convene stakeholders, through a series of public workshops, to 
develop and encourage the use of best practice State policies and 
investment models that address the multiple barriers to investment in 
industrial energy efficiency and CHP;
    (c) utilize their respective relevant authorities and resources to 
encourage investment in industrial energy efficiency and CHP, such as 
by:

(i) providing assistance to States on accounting for the potential emission 
reduction benefits of CHP and other energy efficiency policies when 
developing State Implementation Plans (SIPs) to achieve national ambient 
air quality standards;

(ii) providing incentives for the deployment of CHP and other types of 
clean energy, such as set-asides under emissions allowance trading program 
state implementation plans, grants, and loans;

(iii) employing output-based approaches as compliance options in power and 
industrial sector regulations, as appropriate, to recognize the emissions 
benefits of highly efficient energy generation technologies like CHP; and

(iv) seeking to expand participation in and create additional tools to 
support the Better Buildings, Better Plants program at the Department of 
Energy, which is working with companies to help them achieve a goal of 
reducing energy intensity by 25 percent over 10 years, as well as utilizing 
existing partnership programs to support energy efficiency and CHP;

    (d) support and encourage efforts to accelerate investment in 
industrial energy efficiency and CHP by:

(i) providing general guidance, technical analysis and information, and 
financial analysis on the value of investment in industrial energy 
efficiency and CHP to States, utilities, and owners and operators of 
industrial facilities;

(ii) improving the usefulness of Federal data collection and analysis; and

(iii) assisting States in developing and implementing State-specific best 
practice policies that can accelerate investment in industrial energy 
efficiency and CHP.

In implementing this section, these agencies should consult with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as appropriate.
Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.

[[Page 302]]

    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13625 of August 31, 2012

Improving Access to Mental Health Services for Veterans, Service 
Members, and Military Families

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Since September 11, 2001, more than two million 
service members have deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. Long deployments 
and intense combat conditions require optimal support for the emotional 
and mental health needs of our service members and their families. The 
need for mental health services will only increase in the coming years 
as the Nation deals with the effects of more than a decade of conflict. 
Reiterating and expanding upon the commitment outlined in my 
Administration's 2011 report, entitled ``Strengthening Our Military 
Families,'' we have an obligation to evaluate our progress and continue 
to build an integrated network of support capable of providing effective 
mental health services for veterans, service members, and their 
families. Our public health approach must encompass the practices of 
disease prevention and the promotion of good health for all military 
populations throughout their lifespans, both within the health care 
systems of the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs and in local 
communities. Our efforts also must focus on both outreach to veterans 
and their families and the provision of high quality mental health 
treatment to those in need. Coordination between the Departments of 
Veterans Affairs and Defense during service members' transition to 
civilian life is essential to achieving these goals.
Ensuring that all veterans, service members (Active, Guard, and Reserve 
alike), and their families receive the support they deserve is a top 
priority for my Administration. As part of our ongoing efforts to 
improve all facets of military mental health, this order directs the 
Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, Education, Veterans 
Affairs, and Homeland Security to expand suicide prevention strategies 
and take steps to meet the current and future demand for mental health 
and substance abuse treatment services for veterans, service members, 
and their families.
Sec. 2. Suicide Prevention. (a) By December 31, 2012, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, in continued collaboration with the Department of 
Health and Human Services, shall expand the capacity of the Veterans 
Crisis Line by 50 percent to ensure that veterans have timely access, 
including by telephone, text, or online chat, to qualified, caring 
responders who can help address immediate crises and direct veterans to 
appropriate care. Further, the Department of Veterans Affairs shall 
ensure that any veteran identifying

[[Page 303]]

him or herself as being in crisis connects with a mental health 
professional or trained mental health worker within 24 hours. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs also shall expand the number of mental 
health professionals who are available to see veterans beyond 
traditional business hours.
    (b) The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense shall jointly 
develop and implement a national suicide prevention campaign focused on 
connecting veterans and service members to mental health services. This 
12-month campaign, which shall begin on September 1, 2012, will focus on 
the positive benefits of seeking care and encourage veterans and service 
members to proactively reach out to support services.
    (c) To provide the best mental health and substance abuse 
prevention, education, and outreach support to our military and their 
family members, the Department of Defense shall review all of its 
existing mental health and substance abuse prevention, education, and 
outreach programs across the military services and the Defense Health 
Program to identify the key program areas that produce the greatest 
impact on quality and outcomes, and rank programs within each of these 
program areas using metrics that assess their effectiveness. By the end 
of Fiscal Year 2014, existing program resources shall be realigned to 
ensure that highly ranked programs are implemented across all of the 
military services and less effective programs are replaced.
Sec. 3. Enhanced Partnerships Between the Department of Veterans Affairs 
and Community Providers. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this order, 
in those service areas where the Department of Veterans Affairs has 
faced challenges in hiring and placing mental health service providers 
and continues to have unfilled vacancies or long wait times, the 
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services shall 
establish pilot projects whereby the Department of Veterans Affairs 
contracts or develops formal arrangements with community-based 
providers, such as community mental health clinics, community health 
centers, substance abuse treatment facilities, and rural health clinics, 
to test the effectiveness of community partnerships in helping to meet 
the mental health needs of veterans in a timely way. Pilot sites shall 
ensure that consumers of community-based services continue to be 
integrated into the health care systems of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs. No fewer than 15 pilot projects shall be established.
    (b) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall develop guidance for 
its medical centers and service networks that supports the use of 
community mental health services, including telehealth services and 
substance abuse services, where appropriate, to meet demand and 
facilitate access to care. This guidance shall include recommendations 
that medical centers and service networks use community-based providers 
to help meet veterans' mental health needs where objective criteria, 
which the Department of Veterans Affairs shall define in the form of 
specific metrics, demonstrate such needs. Such objective criteria should 
include estimates of wait-times for needed care that exceed established 
targets.
    (c) The Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans 
Affairs shall develop a plan for a rural mental health recruitment 
initiative to promote opportunities for the Department of Veterans 
Affairs and rural communities to share mental health providers when 
demand is insufficient for either the Department of Veterans Affairs or 
the communities to independently support a full-time provider.

[[Page 304]]

Sec. 4. Expanded Department of Veterans Affairs Mental Health Services 
Staffing. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, by December 31, 2013, 
hire and train 800 peer-to-peer counselors to empower veterans to 
support other veterans and help meet mental health care needs. In 
addition, the Secretary shall continue to use all appropriate tools, 
including collaborative arrangements with community-based providers, 
pay-setting authorities, loan repayment and scholarships, and 
partnerships with health care workforce training programs to accomplish 
the Department of Veterans Affairs' goal of recruiting, hiring, and 
placing 1,600 mental health professionals by June 30, 2013. The 
Department of Veterans Affairs also shall evaluate the reporting 
requirements associated with providing mental health services and reduce 
paperwork requirements where appropriate. In addition, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs shall update its management performance evaluation 
system to link performance to meeting mental health service demand.
Sec. 5. Improved Research and Development. (a) The lack of full 
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD), other mental health conditions, and Traumatic Brain 
Injury (TBI) has hampered progress in prevention, diagnosis, and 
treatment. In order to improve the coordination of agency research into 
these conditions and reduce the number of affected men and women through 
better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, the Departments of Defense, 
Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and Education, in 
coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall 
establish a National Research Action Plan within 8 months of the date of 
this order.
    (b) The National Research Action Plan shall include strategies to 
establish surrogate and clinically actionable biomarkers for early 
diagnosis and treatment effectiveness; develop improved diagnostic 
criteria for TBI; enhance our understanding of the mechanisms 
responsible for PTSD, related injuries, and neurological disorders 
following TBI; foster development of new treatments for these conditions 
based on a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms; improve 
data sharing between agencies and academic and industry researchers to 
accelerate progress and reduce redundant efforts without compromising 
privacy; and make better use of electronic health records to gain 
insight into the risk and mitigation of PTSD, TBI, and related injuries. 
In addition, the National Research Action Plan shall include strategies 
to support collaborative research to address suicide prevention.
    (c) The Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services shall 
engage in a comprehensive longitudinal mental health study with an 
emphasis on PTSD, TBI, and related injuries to develop better 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options. Agencies shall continue 
ongoing collaborative research efforts, with an aim to enroll at least 
100,000 service members by December 31, 2012, and include a plan for 
long-term follow-up with enrollees through a coordinated effort with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs.
Sec. 6. Military and Veterans Mental Health Interagency Task Force. 
There is established an Interagency Task Force on Military and Veterans 
Mental Health (Task Force), to be co-chaired by the Secretaries of 
Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services, or their 
designated representatives.

[[Page 305]]

    (a) Membership. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall

provide to the President a review of agency actions to enhance mental 
health and substance abuse treatment services for veterans, service 
members, and their families consistent with this order, as well as provide 
additional recommendations for action as appropriate. The Task Force shall 
define specific goals and metrics that will aid in measuring progress in 
improving mental health strategies. The Task Force will include cost 
analysis in the development of all recommendations, and will ensure any new 
requirements are supported within existing resources.

(ii) In addition to coordinating and reviewing agency efforts to enhance 
veteran and military mental health services pursuant to this order, the 
Task Force shall evaluate:

    (1) agency efforts to improve care quality and ensure that the 
Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs and community-based 
mental health providers are trained in the most current evidence-

Executive Order 13626 of September 10, 2012

Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 311 of the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) (33 U.S.C. 1321), section 
1006 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2706), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Executive Order 13554 of October 5, 2010, was issued 
after the blowout and explosion of the mobile offshore drilling unit 
Deepwater Horizon that occurred on April 20, 2010, and resulted in the 
largest oil spill in U.S. history (Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill). 
Executive Order 13554 recognized the Gulf Coast as a national treasure 
and addressed the longstanding ecological decline of that region, which 
was compounded by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. In doing so, 
Executive Order 13554 established a Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration 
Task Force (Task Force) to coordinate intergovernmental efforts, 
planning, and the exchange of information in order to better implement 
Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration and facilitate appropriate 
accountability and support throughout the restoration process.
Since the implementation of Executive Order 13554, the Federal 
Government's Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration planning efforts have 
advanced significantly. The Task Force's Gulf of Mexico Regional 
Ecosystem Restoration Strategy (Strategy), created with input from 
Federal, State, tribal, and local governments, and thousands of involved 
citizens and organizations across the region, serves as a comprehensive 
restoration plan for addressing ecological concerns in the Gulf of 
Mexico. In light of the release of the Strategy, the ongoing work of the 
Natural Resource Damage Trustee Council (Trustee Council) under the Oil 
Pollution Act, and the recent passage of the Resources and Ecosystems 
Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf 
Coast States Act of 2012 (RESTORE Act) (title I, subtitle F of Public 
Law 112-141), this order affirms the Federal Government's Gulf Coast 
ecosystem restoration efforts and realigns responsibilities to ensure 
the most effective governmental planning and coordination to reach these 
goals.

[[Page 307]]

Sec. 2. Termination of the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Task Force. 
The progress of the Task Force is noteworthy. It has completed the 
Strategy and the preliminary planning and coordination tasks that it was 
intended to produce and has significantly advanced important ecosystem 
restoration goals for the Gulf of Mexico. In light of the recent 
creation, described below, of the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration 
Council (Gulf Restoration Council), which will build upon the Task 
Force's already successful collaboration between Federal, State, and 
tribal governments and, as directed by statute, include and incorporate 
in its proposed comprehensive plan the findings and information prepared 
by the Task Force, the Task Force shall terminate no later than 60 days 
after the Gulf Restoration Council commences its work. The functions of 
the Task Force will be performed by the Gulf Restoration Council and the 
Trustee Council to the extent practicable, as set forth in this order. 
Prior to its termination, the Task Force will provide such assistance as 
is appropriate to the Gulf Restoration Council.
Sec. 3. The Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund and the Gulf Coast 
Ecosystem Restoration Council.
    (a) Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund. The RESTORE Act, which was 
signed into law as part of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st 
Century Act (Public Law 112-141), established a mechanism for providing 
funding to the Gulf region to restore ecosystems and rebuild local 
economies damaged by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. The RESTORE Act 
established in the Treasury of the United States the Gulf Coast 
Restoration Trust Fund (Trust Fund), consisting of 80 percent of an 
amount equal to any administrative and civil penalties paid after the 
date of the RESTORE Act by the responsible parties in connection with 
the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill to the United States pursuant to a court 
order, negotiated settlement, or other instrument in accordance with 
section 311 of the FWPCA (33 U.S.C. 1321).
    (b) Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council. The RESTORE Act 
established the Gulf Restoration Council, an independent entity charged 
with developing a comprehensive plan for ecosystem restoration in the 
Gulf Coast (Comprehensive Plan), as well as any future revisions to the 
Comprehensive Plan. Among its other duties, the Gulf Restoration Council 
is tasked with identifying projects and programs aimed at restoring and 
protecting the natural resources and ecosystems of the Gulf Coast 
region, to be funded from a portion of the Trust Fund; establishing such 
other advisory committees as may be necessary to assist the Gulf 
Restoration Council, including a scientific advisory committee and a 
committee to advise the Gulf Restoration Council on public policy 
issues; gathering information relevant to Gulf Coast restoration, 
including through research, modeling, and monitoring; and providing an 
annual report to the Congress on implementation progress. Consistent 
with the RESTORE Act, the Comprehensive Plan developed by the Gulf 
Restoration Council will include provisions necessary to fully 
incorporate the Strategy, projects, and programs recommended by the Task 
Force.
    (c) Federal members of the Gulf Restoration Council and Trustee 
Council, as well as all Federal entities involved in Gulf Coast 
restoration, shall work closely with one another to advance their common 
goals, reduce duplication, and maximize consistency among their efforts. 
All Federal members are directed to consult with each other and with all 
non-federal members in carrying out their duties on the Gulf Restoration 
Council.

[[Page 308]]

Sec. 4. Ongoing Role of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee 
Council. (a) Executive Order 13554 recognized the role of the Trustee 
Council, and designated trustees as provided in 33 U.S.C. 2706, with 
trusteeship over natural resources injured, lost, or destroyed as a 
result of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Specifically, Executive Order 
13554 recognized the importance of carefully coordinating the work of 
the Task Force with the Trustee Council, whose members have statutory 
responsibility to assess natural resources damages from the Deepwater 
Horizon Oil Spill, to restore trust resources, and seek compensation for 
lost use of those trust resources. Section 3(b) of Executive Order 13554 
instructed the Task Force to ``support the Natural Resource Damage 
Assessment process by referring potential ecosystem restoration actions 
to the * * * Trustee Council for consideration and facilitating 
coordination among the relevant departments, agencies, and offices, as 
appropriate, subject to the independent statutory responsibilities of 
the trustees.'' The Department of Commerce (through the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration), the Department of the Interior (through 
the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service), and the 
Department of Justice have worked to identify linkages and opportunities 
for the Task Force to complement the restoration progress of the Trustee 
Council.
    (b) Section 7(e) of Executive Order 13554 provides that nothing in 
that order shall interfere with the statutory responsibilities and 
authority of the Trustee Council or the individual trustees to carry out 
their statutory responsibilities to assess natural resource damages and 
implement restoration actions under 33 U.S.C. 2706 and other applicable 
law. Agencies that were members of the Task Force shall continue to 
comply with these requirements.
Sec. 5. Designating Trustees for Natural Resource Damage Assessment. 
Given their authorities, programs, and expertise, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) have 
institutional capacities that can contribute significantly to the 
Natural Resource Damage Assessment and restoration efforts, including 
scientific and policy expertise as well as experience gained in the Task 
Force process and other planning efforts in the Gulf area. In addition, 
EPA's and USDA's relevant authorities cover a range of natural resources 
and their supporting ecosystems, including waters, sediments, barrier 
islands, wetlands, soils, land management, air resources, and drinking 
water supplies. The inclusion of EPA and USDA as trustees participating 
in the Natural Resource Damage Assessment and restoration efforts will 
maximize coordination across the Federal Government and enhance overall 
efficiencies regarding Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration. Accordingly, 
without limiting the designations in Executive Order 12777 of October 
18, 1991, or any other existing designations, and pursuant to section 
2706(b)(2) of title 33, United States Code, I hereby designate the 
Administrator of EPA and the Secretary of Agriculture as additional 
trustees for Natural Resource Damage Assessment and restoration solely 
in connection with injury to, destruction of, loss of, or loss of use of 
natural resources, including their supporting ecosystems, resulting from 
the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. The addition of these Federal trustees 
does not, in and of itself, alter any existing agreements among or 
between the trustees and any other entity. All Federal trustees are 
directed to consult, coordinate, and cooperate with each other in 
carrying out all of their trustee duties and responsibilities.

[[Page 309]]

The Administrator of EPA is hereby directed to revise Subpart G of the 
National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan to 
reflect the designations for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill discussed 
in this section.
Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Trustee Council, or those of the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, relating to budgetary, administrative, or 
legislative proposals.

    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law 
and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
    (d) Executive Order 13554 of October 5, 2010, is hereby revoked 
concurrent with the termination of the Task Force under the terms 
described in section 2 of this order.
Barack Obama
The White House,
    September 10, 2012.
Executive Order 13627 of September 25, 2012

Strengthening Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Federal 
Contracts

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Property and 
Administrative Services Act (40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) and the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Act of 2000, as amended (TVPA) (Public Law 106-386, 
Division A), and in order to strengthen protections against trafficking 
in persons in Federal contracting, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. More than 20 million men, women, and children 
throughout the world are victims of severe forms of trafficking in 
persons (``trafficking'' or ``trafficking in persons'')--defined in 
section 103 of the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7102(8), to include sex trafficking 
in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, 
or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 
years of age, or the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, 
or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of 
force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjection to involuntary 
servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.
The United States has long had a zero-tolerance policy regarding 
Government employees and contractor personnel engaging in any form of 
this

[[Page 310]]

criminal behavior. As the largest single purchaser of goods and services 
in the world, the United States Government bears a responsibility to 
ensure that taxpayer dollars do not contribute to trafficking in 
persons. By providing our Government workforce with additional tools and 
training to apply and enforce existing policy, and by providing 
additional clarity to Government contractors and subcontractors on the 
steps necessary to fully comply with that policy, this order will help 
to protect vulnerable individuals as contractors and subcontractors 
perform vital services and manufacture the goods procured by the United 
States.
In addition, the improved safeguards provided by this order to 
strengthen compliance with anti-trafficking laws will promote economy 
and efficiency in Government procurement. These safeguards, which have 
been largely modeled on successful practices in the private sector, will 
increase stability, productivity, and certainty in Federal contracting 
by avoiding the disruption and disarray caused by the use of trafficked 
labor and resulting investigative and enforcement actions.
Sec. 2. Anti-Trafficking Provisions. (a) Within 180 days of the date of 
this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) Council, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the 
Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the 
Administrator for the United States Agency for International 
Development, and the heads of such other executive departments and 
agencies (agencies) as the FAR Council determines to be appropriate, 
shall take steps necessary to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
to:
    (1) strengthen the efficacy of the Government's zero-tolerance 
policy on trafficking in persons by Federal contractors and 
subcontractors in solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts for 
supplies or services (including construction and commercial items), by:

(A) expressly prohibiting Federal contractors, contractor employees, 
subcontractors, and subcontractor employees from engaging in any of the 
following types of trafficking-related activities:

  (i) using misleading or fraudulent recruitment practices during the 
recruitment of employees, such as failing to disclose basic information or 
making material misrepresentations regarding the key terms and conditions 
of employment, including wages and fringe benefits, the location of work, 
living conditions and housing (if employer provided or arranged), any 
significant costs to be charged to the employee, and, if applicable, the 
hazardous nature of the work;

  (ii) charging employees recruitment fees;

  (iii) destroying, concealing, confiscating, or otherwise denying access 
by an employee to the employee's identity documents, such as passports or 
drivers' licenses; and

  (iv) for portions of contracts and subcontracts:

    (I) performed outside the United States, failing to pay return 
transportation costs upon the end of employment, for an employee 
who is not a national of the country in which the work is taking 
place and who was brought into that country for the purpose of 
working on a U.S. Government contract or subcontract;
    (II) not covered by subsection (a)(1)(A)(iv)(I) of this 
section, failing to pay return transportation costs upon the end 
of employment, for an

[[Page 311]]

employee who is not a national of the country in which the work is 
taking place and who was brought into that country for the purpose 
of working on a U.S. Government contract or subcontract, if the 
payment of such costs is required under existing temporary worker 
programs or pursuant to a written agreement with the employee; 
provided, however
    (III) that the requirements of subsections (a)(1)(A)(iv)(I) 
and (II) shall not apply to:
        (aa) an employee who is legally permitted to remain in the 
        country of employment and who chooses to do so; or
        (bb) an employee who is a victim of trafficking and is seeking 
        victim services or legal redress in the country of employment, 
        or an employee who is a witness in a trafficking-related 
        enforcement action;

  (v) other specific activities that the FAR Council identifies as directly 
supporting or promoting trafficking in persons, the procurement of 
commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor in the performance of the 
contract or subcontract;

(B) requiring contractors and their subcontractors, by contract clause, to 
agree to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to allow 
contracting agencies and other responsible enforcement agencies to conduct 
audits, investigations, or other actions to ascertain compliance with the 
TVPA, this order, or any other applicable law or regulation establishing 
restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex 
acts, or the use of forced labor; and

(C) requiring contracting officers to notify, in accordance with agency 
procedures, the agency's Inspector General, the agency official responsible 
for initiating suspension or debarment actions, and law enforcement, if 
appropriate, if they become aware of any activities that would justify 
termination under section 106(g) of the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7104(g), or are 
inconsistent with the requirements of this order or any other applicable 
law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the

requiring that the agency official responsible for initiating suspension 
and debarment actions consider whether suspension or debarment is necessary 
in order to protect the Government's interest;

    (2) except as provided in subsection (a)(3) of this section, ensure 
that provisions in solicitations and clauses in contracts and 
subcontracts, where the estimated value of the supplies acquired or 
services required to be performed outside the United States exceeds 
$500,000, include the following requirements pertaining to the portion 
of the contract or subcontract performed outside the United States:

(A) that each such contractor and subcontractor maintain a compliance plan 
during the performance of the contract or subcontract that is appropriate 
for the size and complexity of the contract or subcontract and the nature 
and scope of the activities performed, including the risk that the contract 
or subcontract will involve services or supplies susceptible to 
trafficking. The compliance plan shall be provided to the contracting 
officer upon request, and relevant contents of the plan shall be posted no 
later than the initiation of contract performance at the workplace and on 
the contractor or subcontractor's Web site (if one is maintained), and 
shall, at a minimum, include:

of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor; and
    (II) the actions that will be taken against employees for 
violation of such policy;

  (ii) a process for employees to report, without fear of retaliation, any 
activity that would justify termination under section 106(g) of the TVPA,

applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in 
persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced 
labor;

  (iii) a recruitment and wage plan that only permits the use of

host country legal requirements or explains any variance;

  (iv) a housing plan, if the contractor or subcontractor intends to 
provide or arrange housing, that ensures that the housing meets host 
country housing and safety standards or explains any variance; and

  (v) procedures to prevent subcontractors at any tier from engaging in 
trafficking in persons, including those trafficking-related activities 
described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, and to monitor, detect, 
and terminate any subcontractors or subcontractor employees that have 
engaged in such activities; and

(B) that each such contractor and subcontractor shall certify, prior to 
receiving an award and annually thereafter during the term of the contract 
or subcontract, that:

  (i) it has the compliance plan referred to in subsection (a)(2)(A) of 
this section in place to prevent trafficking-related activities described 
in section 106(g) of the TVPA and this order; and

  (ii) either, to the best of its knowledge and belief, neither it nor any 
of its subcontractors has engaged in any such activities; or, if abuses 
have been found, the contractor or subcontractor has taken the appropriate 
remedial and referral actions;

    (3) specify that the requirements in subsections (a)(2)(A) and (B)

evaluating and identifying, for Federal contracts and subcontracts 
performed substantially within the United States, whether there are 
industries or sectors with a history (or where there is current 
evidence) of trafficking-related or forced labor activities described in 
section 106(g) of the TVPA, in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, or 
any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on 
trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the 
use of forced labor. Where the PITF has identified such industries or

[[Page 313]]

sectors, it shall notify agencies of these designations, and individual 
agencies shall, in consultation with the Office of Federal Procurement 
Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, adopt and publish 
appropriate safeguards, guidance, and compliance assistance to prevent 
trafficking and forced labor in Federal contracting in these identified 
areas.
    Sec. 3. Guidance and Training. (a) The Administrator for Federal 
Procurement Policy shall:
    (1) in consultation with appropriate management councils, such as

with actions to prevent trafficking in persons, consistent with section 
106 of the TVPA, including the development of methods to track the 
number of trafficking violations reported and remedies applied; and

investigate, manage, and mitigate contractor and subcontractor trafficking 
violations.

(b) The member agencies of PITF shall jointly facilitate the sharing of 
information that may be used by acquisition, program, and other offices 
within agencies to evaluate where the risk of trafficking in persons may 
be heightened based on the nature of the work to be performed, the place 
of performance, and any other relevant considerations.
    Sec. 4. Effective Date. This order shall become effective

Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.
(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and

(1) the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

actions as they deem appropriate, including denying designation, or 
terminating the continuation of any prior designation of, the sanctioned 
person as a primary dealer in United States Government debt instruments; or

(2) agencies shall prevent the sanctioned person from serving as an agent 
of the United States Government or serving as a repository for United 
States Government funds; or

(iv) agencies shall not procure, or enter into a contract for the 
procurement of, any goods or services from the sanctioned person.

(b) The prohibitions in subsections (a)(i)-(a)(iv) of this section apply 
except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, 
directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and 
notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit 
granted prior to the date of this order.
Sec. 7. (a) When the Secretary of State, in accordance with the terms of 
section 5 of this order, has determined that a person meets any of the 
criteria described in section 5 and has selected any of the sanctions 
set forth below to impose on that person, the Secretary of the Treasury, 
in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall take the following 
actions where necessary to implement the sanctions imposed by the 
Secretary of State:

(i) prohibit any United States financial institution from making loans or 
providing credits to the sanctioned person totaling more than $10,000,000 
in any 12-month period, unless such person is engaged in activities to 
relieve human suffering and the loans or credits are provided for such 
activities;

(ii) prohibit any transactions in foreign exchange that are subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States and in which the sanctioned person has 
any interest;

United States and involve any interest of the sanctioned person;

(iv) block all property and interests in property that are in the United 
States, that come within the United States, or that are or come within

[[Page 319]]

the possession or control of any United States person, including any

directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and

granted prior to the date of this order.
Sec. 8. I hereby determine that, to the extent that section 203(b)(2) of 
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the 
types of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit 
of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked 
pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957, and I hereby 
prohibit such donations as provided by subsections 1(a)(iv), 2(a), 3(a), 
and 7(a)(iv) of this order.
Sec. 9. The prohibitions in subsections 1(a)(iv), 2(a), 3(a), and

interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and

services from any such person.
Sec. 10. I hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and nonimmigrant 
entry into the United States of aliens who meet one or more of the 
criteria in subsections 2(a) and 3(a) of this order would be detrimental 
to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend the entry 
into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of such persons. 
Such persons shall be treated as persons covered by section 1 of 
Proclamation 8693 of July 24, 2011 (Suspension of Entry of Aliens 
Subject to United Nations Security Council Travel Bans and International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act Sanctions).
Sec. 11. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and sections 6(a)(6), 6(a)(7), 
6(a)(8), 6(a)(9), 6(a)(11), and 6(a)(12) of ISA, and to employ all 
powers granted to the United States Government by section 6(a)(3) of 
ISA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The 
Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other 
officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with 
applicable law.
Sec. 12. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of 
evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any 
of the prohibitions set forth in this order or in Executive Order 12957, 
Executive Order 12959, Executive Order 13059, or Executive Order 13599 
is prohibited.

[[Page 320]]

(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order or in Executive Order 12957, Executive Order 12959, 
Executive Order 13059, or Executive Order 13599 is prohibited.
Sec. 13. For the purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(b) the term ``Government of Iran'' includes the Government of Iran, any 
political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the 
Central Bank of Iran, and any person owned or controlled by, or acting 
for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran;
(c) the term ``Iran'' means the Government of Iran and the territory of 
Iran and any other territory or marine area, including the exclusive 
economic zone and continental shelf, over which the Government of Iran 
claims sovereignty, sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, provided that the 
Government of Iran exercises partial or total de facto control over the 
area or derives a benefit from economic activity in the area pursuant to 
international arrangements;
(d) the terms ``knowledge'' and ``knowingly,'' with respect to conduct, 
a circumstance, or a result, mean that a person has actual knowledge, or 
should have known, of the conduct, the circumstance, or the result;
(e) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(f) the term ``sanctioned person'' means a person that the President, or 
the Secretary of State or the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to 
authority delegated by the President and in accordance with the terms of 
such delegation, has determined is a person on whom sanctions shall be 
imposed pursuant to IEEPA, ISA, CISADA, or ITRSHRA, and on whom the 
President, the Secretary of State, or the Secretary of the Treasury has 
imposed any of the sanctions in section 6 of ISA;
(g) for the purposes of section 4 of this order, the term ``subject to 
the jurisdiction of the Government of Iran'' means a person organized 
under the laws of Iran or any jurisdiction within Iran, ordinarily 
resident in Iran, or in Iran, or owned or controlled by any of the

the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States or

permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 14. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence 
in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer 
funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of 
measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures 
ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be 
effective in addressing the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 12957, there need be no

[[Page 321]]

prior notice of an action taken pursuant to subsections 1(a)(iv), 2(a),

Executive Order 13629 of October 26, 2012

Establishing the White House Homeland Security Partnership Council

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to advance the 
Federal Government's use of local partnerships to address homeland 
security challenges, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The purpose of this order is to maximize the Federal 
Government's ability to develop local partnerships in the United States 
to support homeland security priorities. Partnerships are collaborative 
working relationships in which the goals, structure, and roles and 
responsibilities of the relationships are mutually determined. 
Collaboration enables

[[Page 322]]

the Federal Government and its partners to use resources more 
efficiently, build on one another's expertise, drive innovation, engage 
in collective action, broaden investments to achieve shared goals, and 
improve performance. Partnerships enhance our ability to address 
homeland security priorities, from responding to natural disasters to 
preventing terrorism, by utilizing diverse perspectives, skills, tools, 
and resources.
The National Security Strategy emphasizes the importance of 
partnerships, underscoring that to keep our Nation safe ``we must tap 
the ingenuity outside government through strategic partnerships with the 
private sector, nongovernmental organizations, foundations, and 
community-based organizations. Such partnerships are critical to U.S. 
success at home and abroad, and we will support them through enhanced 
opportunities for engagement, coordination, transparency, and 
information sharing.'' This approach recognizes that, given the 
complexities and range of challenges, we must institutionalize an all-
of-Nation effort to address the evolving threats to the United States.
Sec. 2. White House Homeland Security Partnership Council and Steering 
Committee.

Executive Order 13630 of December 6, 2012

Establishment of an Interagency Task Force on Commercial Advocacy

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to help level the 
playing field on behalf of U.S. businesses and workers competing for 
international contracts against foreign firms and to facilitate the 
growth of sales of U.S. goods and services around the world in support 
of the National Export Initiative, it is hereby ordered as follows:

[[Page 325]]

Section 1. Policy. Executive Order 13534 of March 11, 2010, created the 
National Export Initiative (NEI), which provides unprecedented Federal 
support for exports of goods and services by American businesses. 
Executive Order 13534 also established the Export Promotion Cabinet to 
develop and coordinate the implementation of the eight priorities of the 
NEI, which include, but are not limited to, improving advocacy and trade 
promotion efforts on behalf of U.S. exporters, increasing access to 
export financing, and removing barriers to trade and enforcing U.S. 
trade laws and agreements. As part of these responsibilities, the Export 
Promotion Cabinet, in coordination with the Advocacy Center at the 
Department of Commerce, is focused on ensuring that the Federal 
Government's commercial advocacy effectively promotes exports by U.S. 
businesses, particularly by those firms competing for international 
contracts against foreign firms that may benefit from strong home 
government support. The creation of a new whole-of-government commercial 
advocacy task force that will provide enhanced Federal support for U.S. 
businesses competing for international contracts, coordinate the efforts 
of executive branch leadership in engaging their foreign counterparts on 
commercial advocacy issues, and increase the availability of information 
to the U.S. business community about these kinds of export 
opportunities, will ensure that U.S. exporters have more support for 
selling their goods and services in global markets.
Sec. 2. Establishment and Membership. There is hereby established an 
Interagency Task Force on Commercial Advocacy (Task Force).
(a) The Task Force shall be chaired by the Secretary of Commerce (Chair)

(xiii) Small Business Administration;

(xiv) United States Trade and Development Agency; and

(xv) such other agencies as the President, or the Chair, may designate.

(b) The Chair shall designate a senior-level official of the Department of 
Commerce as the Executive Director of the Task Force, who shall be 
responsible for regularly convening and presiding over the meetings of the 
Task Force, determining its agenda, and guiding its work in fulfilling its

[[Page 326]]

functions under this order in coordination with the Advocacy Center at the 
Department of Commerce.

Sec. 3. Functions. The Task Force shall perform the following functions:

(a) review and prioritize commercial advocacy cases in which the Advocacy 
Center at the Department of Commerce has approved the provision of 
commercial advocacy services, and coordinate the activities of relevant 
agencies to enhance Federal support for such cases, in order to increase 
the success of U.S. exporters competing for foreign procurements;

(b) coordinate the engagement of agency leadership with their foreign 
counterparts regarding commercial advocacy issues, particularly with 
respect to their foreign travel and other occasions for engagement with 
foreign officials, and evaluate reports on the outcomes of such engagement, 
in order to increase the number of senior-level agency officials regularly 
and effectively advocating on behalf of U.S. exporters;

(c) develop strategies to raise the awareness of commercial advocacy 
assistance within the U.S. business community in order to increase the 
number of U.S. businesses utilizing commercial advocacy services;

(d) institute processes to obtain and distribute information about foreign 
procurement opportunities that may be of interest to U.S. businesses in 
order to expand awareness of opportunities for U.S. businesses to sell 
their goods and services to foreign governments;

(e) facilitate voluntary short-term personnel exchanges, not to exceed 120 
days, between the Department of Commerce and other Task Force agencies, in 
order to cross-train Federal personnel to better serve U.S. exporters; and

(f) submit a progress report to the Export Promotion Cabinet every 180 
days, which should include, but not be limited to, the number of commercial 
advocacy cases opened and successfully concluded, the number of commercial 
advocacy engagements by senior-level agency officials, and the number of 
U.S. businesses utilizing commercial advocacy services. The Advocacy Center 
at the Department of Commerce will be responsible for managing and tracking 
all commercial advocacy reporting for the Task Force.

Sec. 4. Definitions. For the purposes of this order:

(a) the term ``commercial advocacy'' shall mean Federal support for U.S. 
firms competing for foreign project or procurement opportunities; and

(b) the term ``foreign project or procurement opportunities'' shall mean 
export opportunities, including defense export opportunities, for U.S. 
businesses that involve foreign government decisionmakers, including 
foreign government-owned corporations.

Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) The Commerce Department shall provide 
funding and administrative support for the Task Force to the extent 
permitted by law and consistent with existing appropriations.

(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise effect:

(i) the authority granted by law, regulation, Executive Order, or 
Presidential Directive to an executive department, agency, or the head 
thereof; and

[[Page 327]]

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Executive Order 13632 of December 7, 2012

Establishing the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. Hurricane Sandy made landfall on October 29, 2012, 
resulting in major flooding, extensive structural damage, and 
significant loss of life. A dangerous nor'easter followed 9 days later 
causing additional damage and undermining the recovery effort. As a 
result of these events, thousands of individuals were displaced and 
millions lost power, some for an extended period of time. Over 1,600 
stores were closed, and fuel distribution was severely disrupted, 
further complicating the recovery effort. New York and New Jersey--two 
of the Nation's most populous States--were especially hard hit by these 
storms.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of 
Homeland Security is leading the recovery efforts to assist the affected 
region. A disaster of Hurricane Sandy's magnitude merits a comprehensive 
and collaborative approach to the long-term rebuilding plans for this 
critical region and its infrastructure. Rebuilding efforts must address 
economic conditions and the region's aged infrastructure--including its 
public housing, transportation systems, and utilities--and identify the 
requirements and resources necessary to bring these systems to a more 
resilient condition given both current and future risks.
This order establishes the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force (Task 
Force) to provide the coordination that is necessary to support these 
rebuilding objectives. In collaboration with the leadership provided 
through the National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF), the Task Force 
will identify opportunities for achieving rebuilding success, consistent 
with the NDRF's commitment to support economic vitality, enhance public 
health and safety, protect and enhance natural and manmade 
infrastructure, and ensure appropriate accountability. The Task Force 
will work to ensure that the Federal Government continues to provide 
appropriate resources to support affected State, local, and tribal 
communities to improve the region's resilience, health, and prosperity 
by building for the future.
Sec. 2. Establishment of the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force. 
There is established the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, which 
shall be chaired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
(Chair).
 (a) In addition to the Chair, the Task Force shall consist of the head 
of each of the following executive departments, agencies, and offices, 
or their designated representatives:

(i) the Department of the Treasury;

(ii) the Department of the Interior;

(iii) the Department of Agriculture;

(iv) the Department of Commerce;

(v) the Department of Labor;

(vi) the Department of Health and Human Services;

(vii) the Department of Transportation;

[[Page 329]]

(viii) the Department of Energy;

(ix) the Department of Education;

(x) the Department of Veterans Affairs;

(xi) the Department of Homeland Security;

(xii) the Environmental Protection Agency;

(xiii) the Small Business Administration;

(xiv) the Army Corps of Engineers;

(xv) the Office of Management and Budget;

(xvi) the National Security Staff;

(xvii) the Domestic Policy Council;

(xviii) the National Economic Council;

(xix) the Council on Environmental Quality;

(xx) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;

(xxi) the Council of Economic Advisers;

(xxii) the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental 
Affairs;

(xxiii) the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs; and

(xxiv) such other agencies and offices as the President may designate.

    (b) The Chair shall regularly convene and preside at meetings of the 
Task Force and determine its agenda as the Task Force exercises the 
functions set forth in section 3 of this order. The Chair's duties shall 
also include:

(i) communicating and engaging with States, tribes, local governments, 
Members of Congress, other stakeholders and interested parties, and the 
public on matters pertaining to rebuilding in the affected region;

(ii) coordinating the efforts of executive departments, agencies, and 
offices related to the functions of the Task Force; and

(iii) specifying the form and subject matter of regular reports to be 
submitted concurrently to the Domestic Policy Council, the National 
Security Staff, and the Chair.

Sec. 3. Functions of the Task Force. Consistent with the principles of 
the NDRF, including individual and family empowerment, leadership and 
local primacy, partnership and inclusiveness, public information, unity 
of effort, timeliness and flexibility, resilience and sustainability, 
and psychological and emotional recovery, the Task Force shall:
    (a) work closely with FEMA in the coordination of rebuilding efforts 
with the various intergovernmental activities taken in conjunction with 
the NDRF;
    (b) describe the potentially relevant authorities and resources of 
each member of the Task Force;
    (c) identify and work to remove obstacles to resilient rebuilding in

and promotes the long-term sustainability of communities and ecosystems;

(i) ensure the prompt and orderly transition of affected individuals and

weather events, and identify resources and authorities that can contribute 
to strengthening community and regional resilience as critical

    (g) communicate with affected tribes in a manner consistent with 
Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000, regarding the consultation 
and coordination with Indian tribal governments.
Sec. 4. Task Force Advisory Group. The Chair shall, at his discretion, 
establish an Advisory Group to advise the Task Force and invite 
individuals to participate in it. Participants shall be elected State, 
local, and tribal officials and may include Governors, Mayors, County 
Executives, tribal elected officials, and other elected officials from 
the affected region as the Chair deems appropriate. Members of the 
Advisory Group, acting in their official capacity, may designate 
employees with authority to act on their behalf. The Advisory Group 
shall generally advise the Task Force as requested by the Chair, and 
shall provide input on each element of the Strategy described in section 
5 of this order.
Sec. 5. Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy. (a) Within 180 days of the 
first convening of its members, the Task Force shall prepare a Strategy 
that includes:

(i) a summary of Task Force activities;

(ii) a long-term rebuilding plan that includes input from State, local, and 
tribal officials and is supported by Federal agencies, which is informed by 
an assessment of current vulnerabilities to extreme weather events and 
seeks to mitigate future risks;

(iii) specific outcomes, goals, and actions by Federal, State, local, and 
tribal governments and the private sector, such as the establishment of 
permanent entities, as well as any proposed legislative, regulatory, or 
other actions that could support the affected region's rebuilding; and

(iv) a plan for monitoring progress.

[[Page 331]]

    (b) The executive departments, agencies, and offices listed in

within their expertise.
    (d) The Task Force may establish technical working groups of Task 
Force members, their representatives, and invited Advisory Group members 
and elected officials, or their designated employees, as necessary to 
provide advice in support of their function.
    (e) The Task Force shall terminate 60 days after the completion of 
the Strategy described in section 5 of this order, after which FEMA and 
the lead agencies for the Recovery Support Functions, as described in 
the NDRF, shall continue the Federal rebuilding coordinating roles 
described in section 3 of this order to the extent consistent with the 
NDRF.
Sec. 7. General Provisions. (a) For purposes of this order, ``affected 
tribe'' means any Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or 
community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an 
Indian tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act 
of 1994 (25 U.S.C. 479a), located or with interests in the affected

Memorandum of January 18, 2012

Implementing Provisions of the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation 
Act of 2011 Relating to the Keystone XL Pipeline Permit

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
The Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 requires a 
determination, within 60 days of enactment, of whether the Keystone XL 
pipeline project as set forth in the permit application filed on 
September 19, 2008 (including amendments) (the ``Keystone XL pipeline 
project'') would serve the national interest. The State Department had 
previously explained, on November 10, 2011, that it was seeking 
additional information concerning whether that project served the 
national interest, as necessary to grant the permit. Based on its 
experience and in order to consider relevant environmental issues and 
the consequences of the project on energy security, the economy, and 
foreign policy, the State Department indicated that its review could be 
complete as early as the first quarter of 2013.
I have determined, based upon your recommendation, including the State 
Department's view that 60 days is an insufficient period to obtain and 
assess the necessary information, that the Keystone XL pipeline project, 
as presented and analyzed at this time, would not serve the national 
interest.
Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States including section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code, and in furtherance of Executive Order 13337 
of April 30, 2004 to the extent compatible with this memorandum, I 
direct you to submit the report to the Congress as specified in section 
501(b)(2) of the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 and 
to issue a denial of the Keystone XL pipeline permit application.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the

Notice of January 19, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four 
additional persons who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace 
process. On February 16, 2005, by Executive Order 13372, the President 
clarified the steps taken in Executive Order 12947.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures 
adopted to deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond 
January 23, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten 
to disrupt the Middle East peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of January 20, 2012

Federal Support for the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Thousands of Americans who are blind have embraced the entrepreneurial 
spirit that helps define our Nation as a land of opportunity. Through 
the Federal Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program administered by 
the Department of Education, talented and creative individuals who are 
blind have acquired the management training and business skills 
necessary to realize the American dream--a lifetime of economic 
opportunity, independence, and self-sufficiency for themselves and their 
families.
For 75 years, blind business managers have successfully operated food 
services and commercial ventures at Federal, State, and private 
buildings

[[Page 349]]

and locations nationwide. We honor and celebrate this program's historic 
achievements. We also trust that the Randolph-Sheppard Program will 
continue to be a leading model for providing high-quality 
entrepreneurial opportunities for blind individuals. From a simple snack 
shop, to tourist services at the Hoover Dam, to full food-services 
operations at military installations, blind entrepreneurs have provided 
exceptional customer service to Federal and State employees, the Armed 
Forces, and the general public. With proven ability, they have 
challenged preconceived notions about disability.
The Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.) created the Vending 
Facility Program requiring qualified blind individuals be given a 
priority to operate vending facilities on Federal properties. This 
program is responsible today for providing entrepreneurial opportunities 
for over 2,500 individuals who are blind. In turn, these business 
managers have hired thousands of workers, many of whom are individuals 
with disabilities. Every American, including persons with disabilities, 
deserves the opportunity to succeed without limits, earn equal pay for 
equal jobs, and aspire to full-time, career-oriented employment.
Continued support and cooperation are needed from executive departments, 
agencies, and offices (agencies) to extend the Randolph-Sheppard 
priority to qualified blind managers through the State licensing 
agencies that implement the program. Therefore, I direct all agencies 
that have property management responsibilities to ensure that agency 
officials, when pursuing the establishment and operation of vending 
facilities (including cafeterias and military dining facilities) as 
defined in 20 U.S.C. 107e, issue permits and contracts in compliance 
with the Randolph-Sheppard Program and consistent with existing 
regulations and law. I further direct the Secretary of Education, 
through the Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration, 
to submit a report to the President on agencies' implementation of the 
Randolph-Sheppard Program not later than 1 year from the date of this 
memorandum.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Secretary of Education is hereby authorized and directed to publish 
this memorandum in the Federal Register.

 Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in 
or in Relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire

On February 7, 2006, by Executive Order 13396, the President declared a 
national emergency, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the situation in or in relation to 
C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire and ordered related measures blocking the property 
of certain persons contributing to the conflict in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire. 
The situation in or in relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, which has been 
addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1572 of 
November 15, 2004, and subsequent resolutions, has resulted in the 
massacre of large numbers of civilians, widespread human rights abuses, 
significant political violence and unrest, and fatal attacks against 
international peacekeeping forces.
While the Government of C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire and its people continue to 
make significant progress, the situation in or in relation to C[ocirc]te 
d'Ivoire continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared on February 7, 2006, and the measures adopted on that 
date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond 
February 7, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the

Memorandum of February 17, 2012

Maximizing the Effectiveness of Federal Programs and Functions 
Supporting Trade and Investment

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Winning the future and creating an economy that's built to last will 
require the Federal Government to wisely allocate scarce resources to 
maximize efficiency and effectiveness so that it can best support 
American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. Creating good, 
high-paying jobs in the United States and ensuring sustainable economic 
growth are the top priorities of my Administration. To accomplish these 
goals, we must ensure that U.S. businesses increase their exports of 
goods, services, and agricultural products, and that foreign companies 
recognize the United States as an attractive place to invest and to open 
businesses. While this growth will be fueled by the private sector, the 
Federal Government must do its part to facilitate trade and investment.
Executive Order 13534 of March 11, 2010, established the Export 
Promotion Cabinet to coordinate the development and implementation of 
the National Export Initiative (NEI) to improve conditions that directly 
affect the private sector's ability to export and to help meet my 
Administration's goal of doubling exports over 5 years. Pursuant to the 
terms of the Executive Order, the Export Promotion Cabinet conducts its 
work in coordination

[[Page 353]]

with the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC). The TPCC, 
chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, was authorized by statute in 1992 
(15 U.S.C. 4727) and established by Executive Order 12870 of September 
30, 1993. The NEI has used Government resources and policies to increase 
exports at a pace consistent with the goal of doubling exports by the 
end of 2014. The NEI has accomplished this by opening up foreign markets 
for U.S. exports, enhancing enforcement of our trade laws, providing 
needed export financing, advocating on behalf of U.S. firms, and 
otherwise facilitating U.S. exports. But we must do more.
On January 13, 2012, I announced that I would submit a legislative 
proposal seeking the authority to reorganize the Federal Government in 
order to reduce costs and consolidate agencies (Consolidation 
Authority), and outlined the first use I would make of such authority: 
to streamline functions currently dispersed across numerous agencies 
into a single new department to promote competitiveness, exports, and 
American business. The new department would integrate and streamline 
trade negotiation, financing, promotion, and enforcement functions 
currently housed at half a dozen executive departments and agencies, and 
would include an office dedicated to expanding foreign investment and 
assisting businesses that are considering investing in the United 
States. In addition to the trade and investment functions, the new 
department would include integrated small business, technology, 
innovation, and statistics programs and services from a number of 
departments and agencies, thereby creating a one-stop shop for 
businesses that want to grow and export. We cannot afford to wait until 
the Congress acts, however, and must do all we can administratively to 
make the most efficient and effective use of the Federal Government's 
trade, foreign investment, export, and business programs and functions.
Accordingly, to further enhance and coordinate Federal efforts to 
facilitate the creation of jobs in the United States and ensure 
sustainable economic growth through trade and foreign investment, and to 
ensure the effective and efficient use of Federal resources in support 
of these goals, I hereby direct the following:
    (1) Program Coordination. In coordination with the TPCC, the Export 
Promotion Cabinet shall develop strategies and initiatives in support of 
my Administration's strategic trade and investment goals and priorities, 
including the specific measures outlined in this memorandum. The 
Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for 
International Economics shall coordinate the activities of the Export 
Promotion Cabinet pursuant to this memorandum. Measures and progress 
shall continue to be reported in the annual National Export Strategy 
report of the TPCC. The TPCC will continue to function as it has, 
consistent with its statutorily mandated duties.
    (2) Improving Customer Service for Exporters. Consistent with my 
memorandum of October 28, 2011 (Making it Easier for America's Small 
Businesses and America's Exporters to Access Government Services to Help 
Them Grow and Hire), the Export Promotion Cabinet shall support the 
Steering Committee established pursuant to that memorandum in its 
efforts to create BusinessUSA, a common, open, online platform and web 
service that will, among other things, enable exporters to seamlessly 
access information about export-related Government programs, resources, 
and services regardless of which agency provides them.

[[Page 354]]

    (3) Trade Budget. The Export Promotion Cabinet shall, in 
consultation with the TPCC:

(a) evaluate the allocation of Federal Government resources to assist with 
trade financing, negotiation, enforcement, and promotion, as well as the 
encouragement of foreign investment in the United States, and identify 
potential savings from streamlining overlapping or duplicative programs, as 
well as areas in need of additional resources;

(b) make recommendations to the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) for more effective resource allocation to these functions, 
consistent with my Administration's strategic trade and investment goals 
and priorities, including recommendations to streamline overlapping and 
duplicative programs and reallocate those resources; and

(c) present to the Director of OMB for consideration in the annual process 
for developing the President's Budget, a proposed unified Federal trade 
budget, consistent with my Administration's strategic trade and investment 
goals and priorities.

    (4) Coordination of Offices and Staff. The Export Promotion Cabinet, 
in consultation with the TPCC, shall take steps to ensure the most 
efficient use of its members' domestic and foreign offices and 
distribution networks, including: co-locating offices wherever 
appropriate; cross-training staff to better serve business customers at 
home and abroad by promoting exports to foreign countries and foreign 
investment in the United States; and considering the effectiveness of 
commercial diplomacy, cross-training, and referrals, as appropriate, 
when evaluating employee performance.
    (5) Enhancing Business Competitiveness. Pending passage of 
legislation providing Consolidation Authority, the Export Promotion 
Cabinet shall work with the National Economic Council to develop and 
coordinate administrative initiatives to align and enhance programs that 
enable and support efforts by American businesses, particularly small 
businesses, to innovate, grow, and increase exports.
    (6) General Provisions (a) This memorandum shall be implemented 
consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of 
appropriations.

(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect:

  (i) authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

  (ii) functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any 
party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d) The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of February 21, 2012

Driving Innovation and Creating Jobs in Rural America Through Biobased 
and Sustainable Product Procurement

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The BioPreferred program--established by the Farm Security and Rural 
Investment Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-171)(2002 Farm Bill), and 
strengthened by the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008 (Public 
Law 110-234)(2008 Farm Bill)--is intended to increase Federal 
procurement of biobased products to promote rural economic development, 
create new jobs, and provide new markets for farm commodities. Biobased 
and sustainable products help to increase our energy security and 
independence.
The Federal Government, with leadership from the Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), has made significant strides in implementing the 
BioPreferred program. It is one of the key elements in my efforts to 
promote sustainable acquisition throughout the Government under 
Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009 (Federal Leadership in 
Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance). Further efforts will 
drive innovation and economic growth and create jobs at marginal cost to 
the American public.
The goal of this memorandum is to ensure that executive departments and 
agencies (agencies) effectively execute Federal procurement requirements 
for biobased products, including those requirements identified in 
Executive Order 13514 and prescribed in the 2002 Farm Bill, as amended 
by the 2008 Farm Bill. It is vital that these efforts are in accord and 
carefully coordinated with other Federal procurement requirements.
Therefore, I direct that agencies take the following steps to 
significantly increase Federal procurement of biobased and other 
sustainable products.
Section 1. Actions Related to Executive Order 13514. (a) Agencies shall 
include and report on biobased acquisition as part of the sustainable 
acquisition goals and milestones in the Strategic Sustainability 
Performance Plan required by section 8 of Executive Order 13514.
    (b) As required by section 2(h) of Executive Order 13514, agencies 
shall ensure that 95 percent of applicable new contract actions for 
products and services advance sustainable acquisition, including 
biobased acquisition, where such products and services meet agency 
performance requirements. In doing so, agencies shall:

(i) include acquisition of biobased products in their Affirmative 
Procurement Programs and Preferable Purchasing Programs, as applicable (as

[[Page 356]]

originally required by Executive Order 13101 of September 14, 1998 
(Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal 
Acquisition) and reinforced by Executive Order 13423 of January 24, 2007 
(Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation 
Management) and Executive Order 13514);

(ii) include biobased products as part of their procurement review and 
monitoring program required by section 9002(a) of the 2008 Farm Bill, 
incorporating data collection and reporting requirements as part of their 
program evaluation; and

(iii) provide appropriate training on procurement of biobased products for 
all acquisition personnel including requirements and procurement staff.

    (c) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall emphasize 
biobased purchasing in the fiscal year 2012 and 2013 Sustainability/
Energy scorecard, which is the periodic evaluation of agency performance 
on sustainable acquisition pursuant to section 4 of Executive Order 
13514.
Sec. 2. Biobased Product Designations. The USDA has already designated 
64 categories of biobased products for preferred Federal procurement. 
Although these categories represent an estimated 9,000 individual 
products, less than half of the known biobased products are currently 
included in the preference program. Increasing the number of products 
subject to the Federal procurement preference will increase procurement 
of biobased products. Therefore, I direct the Secretary of Agriculture 
to:
    (a) increase both the number of categories of biobased products 
designated and individual products eligible for preferred purchasing by 
50 percent within 1 year of the date of this memorandum; and
    (b) establish a web-based process whereby biobased product 
manufacturers can request USDA to establish a new product category for 
designation. The USDA shall determine the merit of the request and, if 
the product category is deemed eligible, propose designation within 180 
days of the request.
Sec. 3. Changes in Procurement Mechanisms. Several actions can be taken 
to facilitate improvement in and compliance with the requirements to 
purchase biobased products. To achieve these changes, I direct:
    (a) the Senior Sustainability Officers and Chief Acquisition 
Officers of all agencies to randomly sample procurement actions (such as 
solicitations and awards) to verify that biobased considerations are 
included as appropriate. Agencies shall include results of these 
sampling efforts in the Sustainability/Energy scorecard reported to OMB;
    (b) the Secretary of Agriculture to work with relevant officials in 
agencies that have electronic product procurement catalogs to identify 
and implement solutions to increase the visibility of biobased and other 
sustainable products;
    (c) the Senior Sustainability Officers of all agencies that have 
established agency-specific product specifications, in coordination with 
any other appropriate officials, to review and revise all specifications 
under their control to assure that, wherever possible and appropriate, 
such specifications require the use of sustainable products, including 
USDA-designated biobased products, and that any language prohibiting the 
use of biobased

[[Page 357]]

products is removed. The review shall be on a 4-year cycle. Significant 
review should be completed within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, 
and the results of the reviews shall be annually reported to OMB and the 
Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP); and
    (d) the Secretary of Agriculture to amend USDA's automated contract 
writing system, the Integrated Acquisition System, to serve as a model 
for biobased product procurement throughout the Federal Government by 
adding elements related to acquisition planning, evaluation factors for 
source selection, and specifications and requirements. Once completed, 
USDA shall share the model with all agencies and, as appropriate, assist 
any agency efforts to adopt similar mechanisms.
Sec. 4. Small Business Assistance. A majority of the biobased product 
manufacturers and vendors selling biobased products and services that 
use biobased products to the Federal Government are small businesses. To 
improve the ability of small businesses to sell these products and 
services to the Federal Government, I direct:
    (a) the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Agriculture, to use relevant programs of the Department, such as the 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership network, to improve the performance 
and competitiveness of biobased product manufacturers;
    (b) the Secretary of Agriculture to work cooperatively with 
Procurement Technical Assistance Center programs located across the 
Nation to provide training and assistance to biobased product companies 
to make these companies aware of the BioPreferred program and 
opportunities to sell biobased products to Federal, State, and local 
government agencies; and
    (c) the Secretary of Agriculture to develop training within 6 months 
of the date of this memorandum for small businesses on the BioPreferred 
program and the opportunities it presents, and the Administrator of the 
Small Business Administration (SBA) to disseminate that training to 
Small Business Development Centers and feature it on the SBA website.
Sec. 5. Reporting. The Federal Government should obtain the most 
reliable information to gauge its progress in purchasing biobased 
products, including measuring the annual number of procurements that 
include direct purchase of biobased products, the annual number of 
construction and service contracts that include the purchase of biobased 
products, and the annual volume and type of biobased products the 
Federal Government purchases. I direct that:
    (a) within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulatory Council shall propose an amendment to the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation to require reporting of biobased product 
purchases, to be made public on an annual basis; and
    (b) following the promulgation of the proposed amendment referenced 
in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Agriculture, in 
consultation with the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, shall develop 
a reporting template to facilitate the annual reporting requirement.
Sec. 6. Jobs Creation Research. Biobased products are creating jobs 
across America. These innovative products are creating new markets for 
agriculture and expanding opportunities in rural America. Therefore, I 
direct

[[Page 358]]

the Secretary of Agriculture to prepare a report on job creation and the 
economic impact associated with the biobased product industry to be 
submitted to the President through the Domestic Policy Council and OSTP 
within 2 years of the date of this memorandum. The study shall include:
    (a) the number of American jobs originating from the biobased 
product industry annually over the last 10 years, including the job 
changes in specific sectors;
    (b) the dollar value of the current domestic biobased products 
industry, including intermediates, feedstocks, and finished products, 
but excluding biofuels;
    (c) a forecast for biobased job creation potential over the next 10 
years;
    (d) a forecast for growth in the biobased industry over the next 10 
years; and
    (e) jobs data for both biofuels and biobased products, but shall 
generate separate data for each category.
Sec. 7. Education and Outreach. In compliance with the 2002 Farm Bill, 
several agencies established agency promotion programs to support the 
biobased products procurement preference. The Federal Acquisition 
Institute has added biobased procurement training to its course 
offerings. To assure both formal and informal educational and outreach 
instruction on the BioPreferred program are in place and being 
implemented by each agency, I direct:
    (a) the Secretary of Agriculture to update all existing USDA 
BioPreferred and related sustainable acquisition training materials 
within 1 year of the date of this memorandum;
    (b) the Senior Sustainability Officers and Chief Acquisition 
Officers of agencies to work cooperatively with the Secretary of 
Agriculture to immediately implement such BioPreferred program agency 
education and outreach programs as are necessary to meet the 
requirements of this memorandum and relevant statutes; and
    (c) the Secretary of Agriculture to work actively with the Committee 
for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled to promote 
education and outreach to program, technical, and contracting personnel, 
and to purchase card holders on BioPreferred AbilityOne products.
Sec. 8. General Provisions. (a) This memorandum shall apply to an agency 
with respect to the activities, personnel, resources, and facilities of 
the agency that are located within the United States. The head of an 
agency may provide that this memorandum shall apply in whole or in part 
with respect to the activities, personnel, resources, and facilities of 
the agency that are not located within the United States, if the head of 
the agency determines that such application is in the interest of the 
United States.
    (b) The head of an agency shall manage activities, personnel, 
resources, and facilities of the agency that are not located within the 
United States, and with respect to which the head of the agency has not 
made a determination under subsection (a) of this section, in a manner 
consistent with the policies set forth in this memorandum, to the extent 
the head of the agency determines practicable.
    (c) For purposes of this memorandum, ``biobased product'' shall have 
the meaning set forth in section 8101(4) of title 7, United States Code.

[[Page 359]]

    (d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
    (e) The Secretary of Agriculture is hereby authorized and directed 
to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. On February 26, 2004, by 
Proclamation 7757, the national emergency was extended and its scope was 
expanded to deny monetary and material support to the Cuban government. 
The Cuban government has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the 
use of excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may engage 
in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. In addition, 
the unauthorized entry of any U.S.-registered vessel into Cuban 
territorial waters continues to be detrimental to the foreign policy of 
the United States. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the 
national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority 
relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set 
out in Proclamation 6867 as amended by Proclamation 7757.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Notice of February 23, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Libya

On February 25, 2011, by Executive Order 13566, I declared a national 
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close 
associates who took extreme measures against the people of Libya, 
including by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence 
against unarmed civilians. In addition, there was a serious risk that 
Libyan state assets would be misappropriated by Qadhafi, members of his 
government, members of his family, or his close associates if those 
assets were not protected. The foregoing circumstances, the prolonged 
attacks, and the increased numbers of Libyans seeking refuge in other 
countries caused a deterioration in the security of Libya and posed a 
serious risk to its stability.
We are in the process of winding down the sanctions in response to the 
many positive developments in Libya, including the fall of Qadhafi and 
his government. We are working closely with the new Libyan government 
and with the international community to effectively and appropriately 
ease restrictions on sanctioned entities, including by taking action 
consistent with the U.N. Security Council's decision to lift sanctions 
against the Central Bank of Libya and two other entities on December 16, 
2011. However, the situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States and we need to protect against this threat and the 
diversion of assets or other abuse by certain members of Qadhafi's 
family and other former regime officials. Therefore, the national 
emergency declared on February 25, 2011, and the measures adopted on 
that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond 
February 25, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566.

Memorandum of February 28, 2012

Proposed Revised Habitat for the Spotted Owl: Minimizing Regulatory 
Burdens

Memorandum for the Secretary of the Interior
Today, compelled by court order, the Department of the Interior 
(Department) proposed critical habitat for the northern spotted owl. The 
proposal is an initial step in gathering important information that will 
inform a final decision on what areas should be designated as critical 
habitat for the spotted owl, based on a full evaluation of all key 
criteria: the relevant science, economic considerations, the impact on 
national security, and a balancing of other factors.
Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review), explicitly states that our ``regulatory system must 
protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment while 
promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job 
creation'' (emphasis added). Consistent with this mandate, Executive 
Order 13563 requires agencies to tailor ``regulations to impose the 
least burden on society, consistent with obtaining regulatory 
objectives'' (emphasis added). Executive Order 13563 also requires 
agencies to ``identify and consider regulatory approaches that reduce 
burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of choice'' while selecting 
``those approaches that maximize net benefits.'' To the extent permitted 
by law, our regulatory system must respect these requirements.
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) states: ``[t]he Secretary shall 
designate critical habitat . . . on the basis of the best scientific 
data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact, 
the impact on national security, and any other relevant impact, of 
specifying any particular area as critical habitat'' (emphasis added). 
16 U.S.C. 1533(b). The ESA also provides that ``[t]he Secretary may 
exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the 
benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such area 
as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best 
scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate 
such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the 
species concerned'' (emphasis added). Id. Under the ESA, scientific, 
economic, and other considerations are relevant to critical habitat 
designations. Under a regulation issued by the Department in 1984, 
however, the economic analysis follows the scientific assessment, rather 
than being presented simultaneously with it; one of the purposes of this 
memorandum is to direct you to propose revisions to that regulation.
Consistent with the ESA and Executive Order 13563, today's proposed rule 
emphasizes the importance of flexibility and pragmatism. The proposed 
rule notes the need to consider ``the economic impact'' of the proposed 
rule, outlines a series of potential exclusions from the proposed 
critical habitat, and asks for public comments on those exclusions and 
on other possible exclusions. Private lands and State lands are among 
the potential exclusions, based on a recognition that habitat typically 
is best protected when landowners are working cooperatively to promote 
forest health, and

[[Page 363]]

a recognition--as discussed in the proposed rule--that the benefits of 
excluding private lands and State lands may be greater than the benefits 
of including those areas in critical habitat.
Importantly, the proposed rule recommends, on the basis of extensive 
scientific analysis, that areas identified as critical habitat should be 
subject to active management, including logging, in order to produce the 
variety of stands of trees required for healthy forests. The proposal 
rejects the traditional view that land managers should take a ``hands 
off'' approach to forest habitat in order to promote species health; on-
going logging activity may be needed to enhance forest resilience.
In order to avoid unnecessary costs and burdens and to advance the 
principles of Executive Order 13563, consistent with the ESA, I hereby 
direct you to take the following actions:
    (1) publish, within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, a full 
analysis of the economic impacts of the proposed rule, including job 
impacts, and make that analysis available for public comment;
    (2) consider excluding private lands and State lands from the final 
revised critical habitat, consistent with applicable law and science;
    (3) develop clear direction, as part of the final rule, for 
evaluating logging activity in areas of critical habitat, in accordance 
with the scientific principles of active forestry management and to the 
extent permitted by law;
    (4) carefully consider all public comments on the relevant science 
and economics, including those comments that suggest potential methods 
for minimizing regulatory burdens;
    (5) give careful consideration to providing the maximum exclusion 
from the final revised critical habitat, consistent with applicable law 
and science; and
    (6) to the extent permitted by law, adopt the least burdensome 
means, including avoidance of unnecessary burdens on States, tribes, 
localities, and the private sector, of promoting compliance with the 
ESA, considering the range of innovative ecosystem management tools 
available to the Department and landowners.
Executive Order 13563 states that our regulatory system ``must promote 
predictability and reduce uncertainty.'' Uncertainty on the part of the 
public may be avoided, and public comment improved, by simultaneous 
presentation of the best scientific data available and the analysis of 
economic and other impacts. Accordingly, in order to provide more 
complete information in the future regarding potential economic impacts 
when critical habitat proposals are first offered to the public, I 
direct you to take prompt steps to propose revisions to the current rule 
(which, as noted, was promulgated in 1984 and requires that an economic 
analysis be completed after critical habitat has been proposed) to 
provide that the economic analysis be completed and made available for 
public comment at the time of publication of a proposed rule to 
designate critical habitat.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Notice of March 2, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in 
Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, the President declared a 
national emergency and blocked the property of persons undermining 
democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). He 
took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other 
persons to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. 
These actions and policies have contributed to the deliberate breakdown 
in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically motivated violence and 
intimidation in that country, and to political and economic instability 
in the southern African region.
On November 22, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13391 to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13288 by ordering the blocking of the property of 
additional persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Zimbabwe.
On July 25, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13469, which 
expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288 and ordered the blocking of the property of additional persons 
undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date, on November 22, 2005, and on July 25, 
2008, to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 
6, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran Executive 
Order 12957

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued 
Executive Order 12959, imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat; on August 19, 1997, the President issued 
Executive Order 13059, consolidating and clarifying the previous orders; 
and I issued Executive Order 13553 of September 28, 2010, Executive 
Order 13574 of May 23, 2011, Executive Order 13590 of November 20, 2011, 
and Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012, to take additional steps 
pursuant to this national emergency.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is 
distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2011. This notice shall

Expediting Review of Pipeline Projects From Cushing, Oklahoma, to Port 
Arthur, Texas, and Other Domestic Pipeline Infrastructure Projects

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
In an economy that relies on oil, rising prices at the pump affect all 
of us. With crude oil prices controlling about three-quarters of 
gasoline prices, the most important driver of the price here at home is 
the world oil price--making our economy vulnerable to events halfway 
around the globe. There are no quick fixes to this problem. In the long 
run we need to reduce America's dependence on oil--which is why my 
Administration is implementing historic fuel economy standards for cars 
and trucks, launching new programs to improve energy efficiency in our 
buildings, and facilitating the safe and responsible development of our 
natural gas resources.
But for the foreseeable future, we will continue to rely on oil to help 
fuel our transportation system. As a result, we must safely and 
responsibly develop our oil resources here at home, as part of an all-
of-the-above energy strategy to grow our economy and make us more 
secure.
Because of rising oil production, more efficient cars and trucks, and a 
world-class refining sector that last year was a net exporter of 
petroleum products for the first time in 60 years, we have cut net 
imports by a million barrels a day in the last year alone. By reducing 
our dependence on foreign oil, we will make our Nation more secure and 
improve our trade balance--creating jobs and supporting domestic 
industry.
In order to realize these potential benefits, we need an energy 
infrastructure system that can keep pace with advances in production. To 
promote American energy sources, we must not only extract oil--we must 
also be able to transport it to our world-class refineries, and 
ultimately to consumers.
The need for infrastructure is particularly acute right now. Because of 
advances in drilling technology that allow us to tap new oil deposits, 
we are producing more oil from unconventional sources--places like the 
Eagle

[[Page 368]]

Ford Shale in South Texas, where production grew by more than 200 
percent last year, or the Bakken formation of North Dakota and Montana, 
where output has increased tenfold in the last 5 years alone. In States 
like North Dakota, Montana, and Colorado, rising production is outpacing 
the capacity of pipelines to deliver the oil to refineries.
Cushing, Oklahoma, is a prime example. There, in part due to rising 
domestic production, more oil is flowing in than can flow out, creating 
a bottleneck that is dampening incentives for new production while 
restricting oil from reaching state-of-the-art refineries on the Gulf 
Coast. Moving forward on a pipeline from Cushing to Port Arthur, Texas, 
could create jobs, promote American energy production, and ultimately 
benefit consumers.
Although expanding and modernizing our Nation's pipeline infrastructure 
will not lower prices right away, it is a vital part of a sustained 
strategy to continue to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and enhance 
our Nation's energy security. Therefore, as part of my Administration's 
broader efforts to improve the performance of Federal permitting and 
review processes, we must make pipeline infrastructure a priority, 
ensuring the health, safety, and security of communities and the 
environment while supporting projects that can contribute to economic 
growth and a secure energy future. In doing so, the Federal Government 
must work in partnership with State, local, and tribal governments, 
which play a central role in the siting and permitting of pipelines; 
and, we must protect our natural resources and address the concerns of 
local communities.
Section 1. Expedited Review of Pipeline Projects from Cushing to Port 
Arthur and Other Domestic Pipeline Infrastructure Projects. (a) To 
address the existing bottleneck in Cushing, as well as other current or 
anticipated bottlenecks, agencies shall, to the maximum extent 
practicable and consistent with available resources and applicable laws 
(including those relating to public safety, public health, and 
environmental protection), coordinate and expedite their reviews, 
consultations, and other processes as necessary to expedite decisions 
related to domestic pipeline infrastructure projects that would 
contribute to a more efficient domestic pipeline system for the 
transportation of crude oil, such as a pipeline from Cushing to Port 
Arthur. This subsection shall be implemented consistent with my 
Executive Order of March 22, 2012 (Improving Performance of Federal 
Permitting and Review of Infrastructure Projects), and applicable 
projects shall have their status tracked on the online Federal 
Infrastructure Projects Dashboard referenced therein.
    (b) In expediting reviews pursuant to subsection (a) of this 
section, agencies shall, to the maximum extent practicable and 
consistent with applicable law, utilize and incorporate information from 
prior environmental reviews and studies conducted in connection with 
previous applications for similar or overlapping infrastructure projects 
so as to avoid duplicating effort.
Sec. 2. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be 
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
related to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

[[Page 369]]

    (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other

Memorandum of March 30, 2012

Establishing a Working Group on the Intersection of HIV/AIDS, Violence 
Against Women and Girls, and Gender-related Health Disparities

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Throughout our country, the spread of HIV/AIDS has had a devastating 
impact on many communities. In the United States, there are 
approximately 1.2 million people living with HIV/AIDS, including more 
than 290,000 women. Women and girls now account for 24 percent of all 
diagnoses of HIV infection among United States adults and adolescents. 
The domestic epidemic disproportionately affects women of color, with 
African Americans and Latinas constituting over 70 percent of new HIV 
cases in women. The spread of HIV/AIDS is, in and of itself, a primary 
concern to my Administration. However, gender-based violence and gender-
related health disparities cannot be ignored when addressing the 
domestic public health threat of HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS programs often 
ignore the biological differences and the social, economic, and cultural 
inequities that make women and girls more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. In our 
country, women and girls are all too frequently victimized by domestic 
violence and sexual assault, which can lead to greater risk for 
acquiring this disease. Teenage girls and young women ages 16-24 face 
the highest rates of dating violence and sexual assault. In addition, 
challenges in accessing proper health care can present obstacles to 
addressing HIV/AIDS. Gender-based violence continues to be an 
underreported, common problem that, if ignored, increases risks for HIV 
and may prevent women and girls from seeking prevention, treatment, and 
health services.
My Administration is committed to improving efforts to understand and 
address the intersection of HIV/AIDS, violence against women and girls, 
and gender-related health disparities. To do so, executive departments 
and agencies (agencies) must build on their current work addressing the 
intersection of these issues by improving data collection, research, 
intervention strategies, and training. In order to develop a 
comprehensive Government-

[[Page 370]]

wide approach to these issues that is data-driven, uses effective 
prevention and care interventions, engages families and communities, 
supports research and data collection, and mobilizes both public and 
private sector resources, I direct the following:
Section 1. Working Group on the Intersection of HIV/AIDS, Violence 
Against Women and Girls, and Gender-related Health Disparities. There is 
established within the Executive Office of the President a Working Group 
on the Intersection of HIV/AIDS, Violence Against Women and Girls, and 
Gender-related Health Disparities (Working Group), to be co-chaired by 
the White House Advisor on Violence Against Women and the Director of 
the Office of National AIDS Policy (Co-Chairs). Within 60 days of the 
date of this memorandum, the Co-Chairs shall convene the first meeting 
of the Working Group.
    (a) In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Working Group shall consist of 
representatives from:

(i) the Department of Justice;

(ii) the Department of the Interior;

(iii) the Department of Health and Human Services;

(iv) the Department of Education;

(v) the Department of Homeland Security;

(vi) the Department of Veterans Affairs;

(vii) the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and

(viii) the Office of Management and Budget.

    (b) The Working Group shall consult with the Presidential Advisory 
Council on HIV/AIDS, as appropriate.
    (c) The Department of State, the United States Agency for 
International Development, and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief Gender Technical Working Group shall act in an advisory capacity 
to the Working Group, providing information on lessons learned and 
evidence-based best practices based on their global experience 
addressing issues involving the intersection between HIV/AIDS and 
violence against women.
Sec. 2. Mission and Functions of the Working Group. (a) The Working 
Group shall coordinate agency efforts to address issues involving the 
intersection of HIV/AIDS, violence against women and girls, and gender-
related health disparities. Such efforts shall include, but not be 
limited to:

(i) increasing government and public awareness of the need to address the 
intersection of HIV/AIDS, violence against women and girls, and gender-
related health disparities, including sexual and reproductive health and 
access to health care;

(ii) sharing best practices, including demonstration projects and 
international work by agencies, as well as successful gender-specific 
strategies aimed at addressing risks that influence women's and girls' 
vulnerability to HIV infection and violence;

(iii) integrating sexual and reproductive health services, gender-based 
violence services, and HIV/AIDS services, where research demonstrates that 
doing so will result in improved and sustained health outcomes;

[[Page 371]]

(iv) emphasizing evidence-based prevention activities that engage men and 
boys and highlight their role in the prevention of violence against women 
and HIV/AIDS infection;

(v) facilitating opportunities for partnerships among diverse organizations 
from the violence against women and girls, HIV/AIDS, and women's health 
communities to address the intersection of these issues;

(vi) ensuring that the needs of vulnerable and underserved groups are 
considered in any efforts to address issues involving the intersection of 
HIV/AIDS, violence against women and girls, and gender-related health 
disparities;

(vii) promoting research to better understand the intersection of the 
biological, behavioral, and social sciences bases for the relationship 
between increased HIV/AIDS risk, domestic violence, and gender-related 
health disparities; and

(viii) prioritizing, as appropriate, the efforts described in paragraphs 
(a)(i)-(vii) of this section with respect to women and girls of color, who 
represent the majority of females living with and at risk for HIV infection 
in the United States.

    (b) The Working Group shall annually provide the President 
recommendations for updating the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. In 
addition, the Working Group shall provide information on:

(i) coordinated actions taken by the Working Group to meet its objectives 
and identify areas where the Federal Government has achieved integration 
and coordination in addressing the intersection of HIV/AIDS, violence 
against women and girls, and gender-related health disparities;

(ii) alternative means of making available gender-sensitive health care for 
women and girls through the integration of HIV/AIDS prevention and care 
services with intimate partner violence prevention and counseling as well 
as mental health and trauma services;

(iii) specific, evidence-based goals for addressing HIV among women, 
including HIV-related disparities among women of color, to inform the 
National HIV/AIDS Strategy Implementation Plan (for its biannual review);

(iv) research and data collection needs regarding HIV/AIDS, violence 
against women and girls, and gender-related health disparities to help 
develop more comprehensive data and targeted research (disaggregated by 
sex, gender, and gender identity, where practicable); and

(v) existing partnerships and potential areas of collaboration with other 
public or nongovernmental actors, taking into consideration the types of 
implementation or research objectives that other public or nongovernmental 
actors may be particularly well-situated to accomplish.

Sec. 3. Outreach. Consistent with the objectives of this memorandum and 
applicable law, the Working Group, in addition to regular meetings, 
shall conduct outreach with representatives of private and nonprofit 
organizations, State, tribal, and local government agencies, elected 
officials, and other interested persons to assist the Working Group in 
developing a detailed set of recommendations.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) The heads of agencies shall assist and 
provide information to the Working Group, consistent with applicable 
law, as

[[Page 372]]

may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Working Group. Each 
agency and office shall bear its own expense for carrying out activities 
related to the Working Group.
    (b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or 
otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the 
head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
    (e) The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of April 10, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Somalia

On April 12, 2010, by Executive Order 13536, I declared a national 
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the fragile security situation and the persistence of 
violence in Somalia, and acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the 
coast of Somalia, which have repeatedly been the subject of United 
Nations Security Council resolutions, and violations of the Somalia arms 
embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council.
Because the situation with respect to Somalia continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on April 
12, 2010, and the

[[Page 374]]

measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond April 12, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13536.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of April 18, 2012

Establishing Policies for Addressing Domestic Violence in the Federal 
Workforce

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
Despite the considerable progress made since the initial passage of the 
Violence Against Women Act in 1994 (Public Law 103-322), domestic 
violence remains a significant problem facing individuals, families, and 
communities. Domestic violence causes two million injuries each year, 
and an average of three women in the United States die each day as a 
result of domestic violence. While a disproportionate number of victims 
are women, domestic violence can affect anyone.
The effects of domestic violence spill over into the workplace. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that domestic 
violence costs our Nation $8 billion a year in lost productivity and 
health care costs alone, and other studies have suggested that the full 
economic impact is even higher. Moreover, many victims of domestic 
violence report being harassed in the workplace or experiencing other 
employment-related effects.
As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government should act as a 
model in responding to the effects of domestic violence on its 
workforce. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) have taken 
steps to address this issue, including by enhancing the quality and 
effectiveness of security in Federal facilities and by linking victims 
of domestic violence with Employee Assistance Programs. By building on 
these important efforts and existing policies, the Federal Government 
can further address the effects of domestic violence on its workforce.
It is the policy of the Federal Government to promote the health and 
safety of its employees by acting to prevent domestic violence within 
the workplace and by providing support and assistance to Federal 
employees whose working lives are affected by such violence. Therefore, 
by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. Government-wide Guidance to Address the Effects of Domestic 
Violence on the Federal Workforce. Within 240 days of the date of this

[[Page 375]]

memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, and other interested heads of agencies:
    (a) issue guidance to agencies on the content of agency-specific 
policies, as required by section 2 of this memorandum, to prevent 
domestic violence and address its effects on the Federal workforce. The 
guidance shall include recommended steps agencies can take as employers 
for early intervention in and prevention of domestic violence committed 
against or by employees, guidelines for assisting employee victims, 
leave policies relating to domestic violence situations, general 
guidelines on when it may be appropriate to take disciplinary action 
against employees who commit or threaten acts of domestic violence, 
measures to improve workplace safety related to domestic violence, and 
resources for identifying relevant best practices related to domestic 
violence;
    (b) establish a process for providing technical assistance to 
agencies in developing agency-specific policies, consistent with the 
guidance created pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, that meet 
the needs of their workforce; and
    (c) consider whether issuing further guidance is warranted with 
respect to sexual assault and stalking and, if so, issue such guidance.
Sec. 2. Agency-Specific Actions and Policies. (a) Within 90 days from 
the date of this memorandum, each agency shall make available to the 
Director of OPM any existing agency-specific policies and practices for 
addressing the effects of domestic violence on its workforce.
    (b) Within 120 days from the issuance of the guidance created 
pursuant to section 1 of this memorandum, each agency shall develop or 
modify, as appropriate, agency-specific polices for addressing the 
effects of domestic violence on its workforce, consistent with OPM 
guidance. Each agency shall submit for review and comment to the 
Director of OPM, a draft new or modified agency-specific policy. In 
reviewing the draft agency-specific policies, the Director of OPM shall 
consult with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
and other interested agency heads. Each agency shall issue a final 
agency-specific policy within 180 days after submission of its draft 
policy to the Director of OPM.
Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be 
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.

Notice of May 9, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of 
the Government of Syria

On May 11, 2004, pursuant to his authority under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706, and the Syria 
Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003, Public 
Law 108-175, the President issued Executive Order 13338, in which he 
declared a national emergency with respect to the actions of the 
Government of Syria. To deal with this national emergency, Executive 
Order 13338 authorized the blocking of property of certain persons and 
prohibited the exportation or reexportation of certain goods to Syria. 
The national emergency was modified in scope and relied upon for 
additional steps taken in Executive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, 
Executive Order 13460 of February 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of 
April 29, 2011, Executive Order 13573 of

[[Page 378]]

May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, Executive Order 
13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of May 1, 2012.
The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of the 
Government of Syria in supporting terrorism, maintaining its then-
existing occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and 
missile programs, and undermining U.S. and international efforts with 
respect to the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.
While the Syrian regime has reduced the number of foreign fighters bound 
for Iraq, the regime's own brutality and repression of its citizens who 
have been calling for freedom and a representative government endangers 
not only the Syrian people themselves, but could yield greater 
instability throughout the region. The Syrian regime's actions and 
policies, including obstructing the Lebanese government's ability to 
function effectively, pursuing chemical and biological weapons, and 
supporting terrorist organizations, continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency 
declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures adopted on that date in 
Executive Order 13338; on April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 13399; on 
February 13, 2008, in Executive Order 13460; on April 29, 2011, in 
Executive Order 13572; on May 18, 2011, in Executive Order 13573; on 
August 17, 2011, in Executive Order 13582; on April 22, 2012, in 
Executive Order 13606; and on May 1, 2012, in Executive Order 13608, to 
deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2012. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency declared with respect to the actions of the Government of 
Syria.
In addition, the United States condemns the Asad regime's use of brutal 
violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Asad regime to step 
aside and immediately begin a transition in Syria to a political process 
that will forge a credible path to a future of greater freedom, 
democracy, opportunity, and justice. The United States will consider 
changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Government of 
Syria in determining whether to continue or terminate this national 
emergency in the future. This notice shall be published in the Federal 
Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect To Burma

On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, certifying 
to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-

[[Page 379]]

208), that the Government of Burma had committed large-scale repression 
of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 1996, thereby 
invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by United States 
persons contained in that section. The President also declared a 
national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter alia, 
of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701-1706.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency in 
Executive Orders 13047 of May 20, 1997; 13310 of July 28, 2003; 13448 of 
October 18, 2007; and 13464 of April 30, 2008, must continue in effect 
beyond May 20, 2012.
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies

an affront to American values. The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 
(PREA) was enacted with bipartisan support and established a ``zero-
tolerance standard'' for rape in prisons in the United States. 42 U.S.C. 
15602(1).
My Administration, with leadership from the Department of Justice, has 
worked diligently to implement the principles set out in PREA. Today, 
the Attorney General finalized a rule adopting national standards to 
prevent, detect, and respond to prison rape. This rule expresses my 
Administration's conclusion that PREA applies to all Federal confinement 
facilities, including those operated by executive departments and 
agencies (agencies) other than the Department of Justice, whether 
administered by the Federal Government or by a private organization on 
behalf of the Federal Government.
Each agency is responsible for, and must be accountable for, the 
operations of its own confinement facilities, and each agency has 
extensive expertise regarding its own facilities, particularly those 
housing unique populations. Thus, each agency is best positioned to 
determine how to implement the Federal laws and rules that govern its 
own operations, the conduct of its own employees, and the safety of 
persons in its custody. To advance the goals of PREA, we must ensure 
that all agencies that operate confinement

[[Page 380]]

facilities adopt high standards to prevent, detect, and respond to 
sexual abuse. In addition to adopting such standards, the success of 
PREA in combating sexual abuse in confinement facilities will depend on 
effective agency and facility leadership and the development of an 
agency culture that prioritizes efforts to combat sexual abuse.
In order to implement PREA comprehensively across the Federal 
Government, I hereby direct all agencies with Federal confinement 
facilities that are not already subject to the Department of Justice's 
final rule to work with the Attorney General to propose, within 120 days 
of the date of this memorandum, any rules or procedures necessary to 
satisfy the requirements of PREA and to finalize any such rules or 
procedures within 240 days of their proposal.
This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with the requirements of 
Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000 (Consultation and Coordination 
With Indian Tribal Governments).
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized 
and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of May 18, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Stabilization 
of Iraq

On May 22, 2003, by Executive Order 13303, the President declared a 
national emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain 
other property in which Iraq has an interest, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The 
President took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq.
In Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, Executive Order 13350 of 
July 29, 2004, Executive Order 13364 of November 29, 2004, and Executive 
Order 13438 of July 17, 2007, the President modified the scope of the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 and took additional 
steps in response to this national emergency.

[[Page 381]]

Because the obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13303, as modified in scope and 
relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Orders 13315, 13350, 
13364, and 13438, must continue in effect beyond May 22, 2012. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of May 23, 2012

Building a 21st Century Digital Government

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The innovative use of technology is fundamentally transforming how the 
American people do business and live their daily lives. Exponential 
increases in computing power, the rise of high-speed networks, and the 
growing mobile revolution have put the Internet at our fingertips, 
encouraging innovations that are giving rise to new industries and 
reshaping existing ones.
Innovators in the private sector and the Federal Government have used 
these technological advances to fundamentally change how they serve 
their customers. However, it is time for the Federal Government to do 
more. For far too long, the American people have been forced to navigate 
a labyrinth of information across different Government programs in order 
to find the services they need. In addition, at a time when Americans 
increasingly pay

[[Page 385]]

bills and buy tickets on mobile devices, Government services often are 
not optimized for smartphones or tablets, assuming the services are even 
available online.
On April 27, 2011, I issued Executive Order 13571 (Streamlining Service 
Delivery and Improving Customer Service), requiring executive 
departments and agencies (agencies) to, among other things, identify 
ways to use innovative technologies to streamline their delivery of 
services to lower costs, decrease service delivery times, and improve 
the customer experience. As the next step toward modernizing the way 
Government works, I charged my Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) 
with developing a comprehensive Government-wide strategy to build a 21st 
century digital Government that delivers better digital services to the 
American people.
Today, the CIO is releasing that strategy, entitled ``Digital 
Government: Building a 21st Century Platform to Better Serve the 
American People'' (Strategy), which provides agencies with a 12-month 
roadmap that focuses on several priority areas. The Strategy will enable 
more efficient and coordinated digital service delivery by requiring 
agencies to establish specific, measurable goals for delivering better 
digital services; encouraging agencies to deliver information in new 
ways that fully utilize the power and potential of mobile and web-based 
technologies; ensuring the safe and secure delivery and use of digital 
services to protect information and privacy; requiring agencies to 
establish central online resources for outside developers and to adopt 
new standards for making applicable Government information open and 
machine-readable by default; aggregating agencies' online resource pages 
for developers in a centralized catalogue on www.Data.gov; and requiring 
agencies to use web performance analytics and customer satisfaction 
measurement tools on all ``.gov'' websites.
Ultimately, this Strategy will ensure that agencies use emerging 
technologies to serve the public as effectively as possible. As a 
Government, and as a trusted provider of services, we must never forget 
who our customers are--the American people.
In order to ensure that agencies make the best use of emerging 
technologies in serving the public, I hereby direct each agency to take 
the following actions:

  (1) implement the requirements of the Strategy within 12 months of the 
date of this memorandum and comply with the timeframes for specific actions 
specified therein; and

  (2) within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, create a page on its 
website, located at www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy, to publicly report 
progress in meeting the requirements of the Strategy in a machine-readable 
format.

This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and 
subject to the availability of appropriations, and with appropriate 
protections for privacy and civil liberties.

Memorandum of June 7, 2012

Improving Repayment Options for Federal Student Loan Borrowers

Memorandum for the Secretary of Education [and] the Secretary of the 
Treasury
More individuals than ever before are using student loans to finance 
college. Nearly two-thirds of college graduates borrow to pay for 
college, with an average debt upon graduation of about $26,300. While a 
college education remains an excellent investment, this debt can be 
overly burdensome, especially for recent graduates during the first few 
years of their careers.
The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan for Federal student loans 
currently allows former students to cap their student loan payments at 
15 percent of their current discretionary income. This plan can be an 
effective

[[Page 387]]

tool for helping individuals to manage their debt, especially during 
challenging economic times.
Over the past several years, my Administration has worked to improve 
repayment options available to borrowers, including through passage of 
an enhanced Income-Based Repayment plan, which will cap a Federal 
student loan borrower's monthly payments at 10 percent of his or her 
discretionary income starting in 2014. And we are pursuing 
administrative action that may extend these lower payments to some 
students as soon as the end of this calendar year.
However, too few borrowers are aware of the options available to them to 
help manage their student loan debt, including reducing their monthly 
payment through IBR. Additionally, too many borrowers have had 
difficulties navigating and completing the IBR application process once 
they have started it.
For many borrowers, the most significant challenge in completing the IBR 
application has been the income-verification process, which, until 
recently, required borrowers to provide a signed copy of their income 
tax return. Although the Department of Education has recently removed 
some of the hurdles to completing the process, too many borrowers are 
still struggling to access this important repayment option due to 
difficulty in applying.
Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby 
direct the following:
Section 1. Streamlined Application Process for Income-Based Repayment 
Plans. By September 30, 2012, the Secretary of Education, in 
coordination with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, shall create a 
streamlined online application process for IBR that allows student loan 
borrowers with federally held loans to import their Internal Revenue 
Service income data directly into the IBR application. This process will 
allow income information to be seamlessly transmitted so that borrowers 
can complete the application at one sitting. Federal direct student loan 
borrowers shall no longer be required to contact their loan servicer as 
the first step to apply.
Sec. 2. Integrated Online and Mobile Resources for Loan Repayment 
Options and Debt Management. By July 15, 2012, the Secretary of 
Education shall:
(a) create integrated online and mobile resources for students and 
former students to use in learning about Federal student aid, including 
an explanation of (1) the current IBR plan, which allows student loan 
borrowers to cap their monthly loan payments at 15 percent of their 
discretionary income and be eligible to have their remaining loan 
balances forgiven after 25 years of responsible payments; and (2) the 
proposed Pay As You Earn plan, which will allow many students to cap 
their monthly loan repayments at 10 percent of their discretionary 
income and be eligible for loan forgiveness after 20 years of 
responsible repayment; and
(b) develop and make available to borrowers an online tool to help 
students make better financial decisions, including understanding their 
loan debt and its impact on their everyday lives. This tool should 
incorporate key elements of best practices in financial literacy and 
link to students' actual Federal loan data to help them understand their 
individual circumstances and options for repayment.

[[Page 388]]

Sec. 3. Improved Notification of the Income-Based Repayment Plan. The 
Secretary of Education shall instruct Federal direct student loan 
servicers to make borrowers aware of the option to participate in IBR 
before a student leaves school and upon entering repayment. Within 1 
year of the date of this memorandum, the Department of Education shall 
make available, for institutions of higher education, a model exit 
counseling module that will enable students to understand their 
repayment options before leaving school and to choose a repayment plan 
for their student loans that best meets their needs.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be 
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.

this memorandum in the Federal Register.

 Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of

Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the Treasury[, 
and] the Secretary of Energy
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, after carefully considering the report 
submitted to the Congress by the Energy Information Administration on 
April 27, 2012, and other relevant factors, including global economic 
conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, the level of 
spare capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves, I determine, 
pursuant to section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Public Law 112-81, and 
consistent with my determination of March 30, 2012, that there is a 
sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products

[[Page 389]]

from countries other than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the 
volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions and 
Policies of Certain Members of the Government of Belarus and Other 
Persons To Undermine Belarus Democratic Processes or Institutions

On June 16, 2006, by Executive Order 13405, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Belarus, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to 
undermine Belarus democratic processes or institutions, to commit human 
rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and 
disappearances, and to engage in public corruption, including by 
diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public 
authority.
In 2011, the Government of Belarus continued its crackdown against 
political opposition, civil society, and independent media. The 
government arbitrarily arrested, detained, and imprisoned citizens for 
criticizing officials or for participating in demonstrations; imprisoned 
at least one human rights activist on manufactured charges; and 
prevented independent media from disseminating information and 
materials. These actions show that the Government of Belarus has taken 
additional steps backward in the development of democratic governance 
and respect for human rights.
The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus 
and other persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. 
Accordingly, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond June 16, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13405.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Usable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``order'') blocking property and interests in property of the Government 
of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of United States persons that are directly related 
to the implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation 
Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from 
Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related contracts and 
agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU Agreements 
allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived from 
nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial 
purposes. The order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50

[[Page 391]]

U.S.C. 1701-1706) and declared a national emergency to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation 
created by the accumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile 
material in the territory of the Russian Federation.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2012, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the Russian 
Federation.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to North Korea

On June 26, 2008, by Executive Order 13466, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States constituted by the existence and risk of proliferation of 
weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President 
also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with 
respect to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to 
Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008, which terminated the exercise of 
authorities under the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1-44) 
with respect to North Korea.
On August 30, 2010, I signed Executive Order 13551, which expanded the 
scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the continued 
actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested by its 
unprovoked attack that resulted in the sinking of the Republic of Korea 
Navy ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its 
announced test of a nuclear device and its missile launches in 2009; its 
actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions

counterfeiting of goods and currency, bulk cash smuggling, and narcotics 
trafficking, which destabilize the Korean Peninsula and imperil U.S. 
Armed Forces, allies, and trading partners in the region.
On April 18, 2011, I signed Executive Order 13570 to take additional 
steps to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13466 and expanded in Executive Order 13551 that will ensure the 
implementation of the import restrictions contained in UNSCRs 1718 and 
1874 and complement the import restrictions provided for in the Arms 
Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.).
Because the existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable 
fissile material on the Korean Peninsula and the actions and policies of 
the Government of North Korea continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States, the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 13466, expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551, and 
addressed further in Executive Order 13570, and the measures taken to 
deal with that national emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 
26, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western 
Balkans

On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of 
persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) 
extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the 
Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the 
Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo. The President subsequently amended 
that order in Executive Order 13304 of May 28, 2003.
Because the actions of persons threatening the peace and international 
stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
the United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and 
the measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that 
emergency,

[[Page 393]]

must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2012. Therefore, in accordance 
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the 
Western Balkans.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

The Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Former 
Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor

On July 22, 2004, by Executive Order 13348, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures, including the blocking 
of the property of certain persons connected to the former Liberian 
regime of Charles Taylor, pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
former Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in 
particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their 
removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property, which 
have undermined Liberia's transition to democracy

[[Page 395]]

and the orderly development of its political, administrative, and 
economic institutions and resources.
Although Liberia has made advances to promote democracy, and the Special 
Court for Sierra Leone recently convicted Charles Taylor for war crimes 
and crimes against humanity, the actions and policies of Charles Taylor 
and others have left a legacy of destruction that could still challenge 
Liberia's transformation and recovery. Because the actions and policies 
of these persons continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared 
on July 22, 2004, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond July 22, 2012. Therefore, 
in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 13348.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect To Significant 
Transnational Criminal Organizations

On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, I declared a national 
emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act 
(50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States constituted by the activities of significant transnational 
criminal organizations.
The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have 
reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of 
international political and economic systems. Such organizations are 
becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States. 
They are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign 
governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening 
democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining 
economic markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent 
civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other 
dangerous persons.
Because the activities of significant transnational criminal 
organizations continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13581 of July 24, 
2011, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, 
must continue in effect beyond July 24, 2012. Therefore, in accordance 
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13581.

Memorandum of July 19, 2012

Ensuring the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act 
(USERRA) Protections

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 
(USERRA) protects individuals performing, or who performed, uniformed 
service in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4301-4335 from adverse employment 
discrimination on the basis of their uniformed service, and provides for 
their prompt restoration to civilian employment when they return to 
civilian life.
USERRA is intended to ensure that these service members are not 
disadvantaged in their civilian careers because of their service; are 
promptly reemployed in their civilian jobs upon their return from duty; 
and are not discriminated against in employment because of their 
military status or obligations. This memorandum will help ensure that 
Federal agencies improve compliance with USERRA through outreach, 
education, and oversight.
The Administration strongly believes that every man or woman who has 
served in our country's uniformed services deserves the full protection 
of our employment laws, including USERRA. No discrimination or unfair 
treatment based on one's service will be tolerated. We must do our 
utmost to ensure that all service members' employment and reemployment 
rights are respected.
The Federal Government, as our Nation's largest employer, has a 
responsibility to adopt best practices with respect to employing 
returning service members. Attracting and retaining the best talent 
means ensuring fair treatment for individuals who have served our 
country. Close attention must be paid to our returning service members 
to ensure that we protect their reemployment rights, and effectively 
manage their reintegration when they return from service.
As a critical part of that effort, I am directing executive departments 
and agencies (agencies) to take steps to ensure robust compliance with 
USERRA's employment and reemployment protections across the Federal 
Government through outreach, education, and oversight. Ensuring 
agencies' compliance with USERRA across the Federal Government will 
maintain our commitment to those who serve.
This effort will build upon, and be in furtherance of, Executive Order 
13518 of November 9, 2009 (Employment of Veterans in the Federal 
Government), which directed agencies to take steps to enhance 
recruitment of

[[Page 397]]

and promote employment opportunities for veterans within the executive 
branch. Over the last few years, the Federal Government has made a 
concerted and successful effort to increase the hiring of military 
veterans and members of the National Guard and Reserves, and veterans 
now constitute a higher percentage of the Federal workforce than they 
have in years.
The Federal Government must continue to improve outreach to the 
uniformed services, veteran, Guard, and Reserve communities; improve 
agencies' USERRA training and guidance; and ensure that service members 
and veterans in Federal employment receive the full extent of their 
employment protections, including USERRA protections. Therefore, by the 
authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of 
the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. USERRA Employment Protection Working Group. There is 
established the USERRA Employment Protection Working Group (Working 
Group), to be co-chaired by the Assistant to the President for Domestic 
Policy and the Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor, 
or their designated representatives, which shall coordinate and review 
agency efforts to implement USERRA.
    (a) In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Working Group shall include 
representatives from:

(i) the Department of Defense;

(ii) the Department of Justice;

(iii) the Department of Labor;

(iv) the Department of Veterans Affairs;

(v) the Office of Personnel Management;

(vi) the Office of the Special Counsel; and

(vii) such other agencies or offices as the Co-Chairs may designate.

    (b) In addition to coordinating and reviewing agency efforts to 
implement USERRA pursuant to this memorandum, the Working Group shall:

(i) collect data to better track the Federal Government's performance in 
implementing USERRA protections;

(ii) coordinate agency efforts to implement best practices, training, and 
procedures for any agency officials who are authorized to recommend, take, 
or approve any personnel action with respect to employees of the agency in 
order to improve compliance with USERRA employment and reemployment 
protections; and

(iii) conduct outreach to veterans and members of the National Guard and 
Reserve and other members of the uniformed services to assist them in fully 
exercising their employment rights.

    (c) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, the head of each 
agency shall designate a senior agency official to act as a liaison 
between the agency and the Working Group. The agency liaison shall be 
responsible for providing the Working Group with information on agency 
efforts to implement this memorandum, as well as any other relevant 
information on service member employment that the Working Group may 
require.

[[Page 398]]

    (d) Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Working Group 
shall report to the President on Government-wide progress in 
implementing this memorandum.
Sec. 2. Federal USERRA Guidance. (a) Within 180 days of the date of this 
memorandum, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, in 
consultation with the Council on Veterans Employment established by 
Executive Order 13518 and offices and agencies participating in the 
Working Group, as appropriate, shall issue guidance to agencies on 
Federal USERRA employment protection, which shall describe specific 
steps agencies can take to improve USERRA employment and reemployment 
protection policies and practices, including:

(i) improving data collection procedures to help better track overall 
service member employment data in the Federal Government, including Guard 
and Reserve members;

(ii) using appropriate metrics, as established by the Office of Personnel 
Management, to measure implementation of this memorandum;

(iii) using guidance and tools, as developed by the Office of Personnel 
Management through collaboration with the Working Group and Council on 
Veterans Employment, which draw upon best agency practices as well as 
practices and guidance from the private sector; and

(iv) strengthening relationships between service members, stakeholder 
groups, and the agency, and providing better information to service members 
so as to allow them to be reintegrated as quickly and efficiently as 
possible when they return to civilian life.

    (b) In the course of developing guidance pursuant to subsection (a), 
the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with 
the Council on Veterans Employment and offices and agencies 
participating in the Working Group as appropriate, shall review relevant 
statutes, regulations, policies, and agency training and guidance to 
identify reforms that would facilitate improved implementation of and 
compliance with USERRA. The Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management, in consultation with the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB), shall report to the President on this 
review, no later than 1 year from the date of this memorandum, and 
provide recommendations for changes to laws, regulations, and policies 
that would strengthen USERRA protections.
    (c) In developing guidance pursuant to subsection (a), the Director 
of the Office of Personnel Management shall consult with affected 
agencies, interagency groups, and public stakeholders.
    (d) The Department of Defense and the Office of Personnel Management 
shall work together to improve data collection procedures to help better 
track the overall veteran and service member employment data in the 
Federal Government, particularly Guard and Reserve Members.
Sec. 3. Ensuring USERRA Employment Protection. The head of each agency 
shall, as expeditiously as possible:
    (a) implement the guidance issued pursuant to section 2 of this 
memorandum;
    (b) ensure that the agency has prioritized policies and actions to 
implement USERRA employment protections, including providing appropriate

[[Page 399]]

training and information, as well as undertaking appropriate 
reemployment measures; and
    (c) allocate sufficient resources to effectively implement the 
requirements of this memorandum, subject to the availability of 
appropriations.
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be 
construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head 
thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, 
administrative, or legislative proposals.

    (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable 
law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
    (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any 
right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in 
equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other 
person.
    (d) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with the 
requirements of this memorandum.
The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is hereby authorized 
and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Actions of 
Certain Persons To Undermine the Sovereignty of Lebanon or Its 
Democratic Processes or Institutions

On August 1, 2007, by Executive Order 13441, the President declared a 
national emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of 
certain persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic 
processes or institutions and certain other persons, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The 
President determined that the actions of certain persons to undermine 
Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government or democratic 
institutions; to contribute to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of 
law in Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and 
intimidation; to reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian 
interference in Lebanon; or to infringe upon or undermine Lebanese 
sovereignty contribute to political and economic instability in that 
country and the region and constitute an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.

[[Page 400]]

Certain ongoing activities, such as continuing arms transfers to 
Hizballah that include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems, serve 
to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to political and economic 
instability in Lebanon, and continue to constitute an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared on August 1, 
2007, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, 
must continue in effect beyond August 1, 2012. In accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order

Continuation of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of 
Colombia

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by section 1012 of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended 
(22 U.S.C. 2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Colombia, that: 
(1) interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily 
engaged in illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is 
necessary, because of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug 
trafficking to the national security of that country; and (2) Colombia 
has appropriate procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of 
life in the air and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, 
which shall at a minimum include effective means to identify and warn an 
aircraft before the use of force is directed against the aircraft.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this 
determination in the Federal Register and to notify the Congress of this 
determination.

On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided to the 
President under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the President issued Executive Order 13222. In 
that order, he declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual

economy of the United States in light of the expiration of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). 
Because the Export Administration Act has not been renewed by the 
Congress, the national emergency declared on August 17, 2001, must 
continue in effect beyond August 17, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with

previously declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, the President declared 
a national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to 
commit, or support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). The President took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted 
by the grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by 
foreign terrorists, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 
2001, in New York and Pennsylvania and against the Pentagon, and the 
continuing and immediate threat of further attacks against United States 
nationals or the United States. Because the actions of these persons who 
commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an

Presidential Determination No. 2012-15 of September 14, 2012

 Presidential Determination on Major Illicit Drug Transit or Major 
Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2013

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the 
following countries as major drug transit and/or major illicit drug 
producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, 
Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, 
Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.
A country's presence on the majors list is not necessarily an adverse 
reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of 
cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory 
definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth 
in section 481(e)(2) and (5)

[[Page 404]]

of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the 
reasons major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are 
placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and 
economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if a 
government has carried out stringent narcotics control law enforcement 
measures.
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, 
Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during 
the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under 
international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set 
forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Included in this report are 
justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, 
as required by section 706(2)(B) of the FRAA.
I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 
706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Bolivia, Burma, 
and Venezuela is vital to the national interests of the United States.
Afghanistan produces approximately 90 percent of the world's illicit 
opium. Nearly all of this cultivation occurs in four southern and 
western provinces. Instability in the area allows criminal networks, 
insurgent groups, and illicit cultivation and drug production to thrive. 
While Helmand Province continues to be the largest poppy-cultivating 
area, the United States and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC) estimate that cultivation in Helmand decreased between 35 and 39 
percent, respectively, since 2008, to roughly 63,000 hectares.
The strategic objective of Afghanistan's Ministry of Counter Narcotics, 
as stated in its National Drug Control Strategy, is ``to create a secure 
environment for a healthy society with a strong licit economy, through 
evidence-based policy-setting, effective coordination and full 
accountability to the people of Afghanistan and our government.'' The 
ongoing Good Performer Initiative, now in its sixth year, rewards 
provinces for successful counternarcotics performance. In 2011, 22 of 
Afghanistan's 34 provinces qualified for $19.2 million in development 
projects as the result of their poppy reduction efforts.
Afghanistan's gains remain fragile. Reducing illegal cultivation and 
trafficking are closely linked to broader economic opportunity, 
security, and the ability of the Afghan government to project the rule 
of law. International support for the Afghan National Drug Control 
Strategy, including from the United States, is designed to bolster the 
country's drug control undertakings and is directly tied to the success 
of the country's wide-ranging national objectives to improve peace, 
security, and economic development.
This year, the Caribbean was examined for its relative importance as a 
transit zone for illegal substances destined for U.S. markets. Without 
factoring in illegal maritime and air drug smuggling believed to be 
destined for Europe and beyond, approximately 5 percent of all drugs 
destined for the United States are estimated to pass through the majors 
list countries of The Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. 
As traffickers constantly reorder their routes and methods, the United 
States and other donors continue to believe that countering the drug 
trade in the Caribbean is in our national interest, as well as that of 
the countries themselves. Without the rule of law, well-run 
institutions, and effective drug interdiction, the viability of the 
broad range of national and regional goals adopted by Caribbean 
countries is threatened.

[[Page 405]]

European, Canadian, and U.S. bilateral drug control support, as well as 
the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, contribute to the region's 
ability to prevent and address drug trafficking and related violence and 
crime in the Caribbean. Similarly, key undertakings by the Organization 
of American States and UNODC in the region--especially those aimed at 
bringing long-term stability to Haiti--are an important part of the 
policy and assistance mosaic for smaller countries seeking to build on 
the successes of broad regional policies and programs.
United States analysts estimate that approximately 95 percent of illegal 
drugs cultivated and produced in South America destined for the United 
States are smuggled through Central America, Mexico, and the Eastern 
Pacific, primarily using maritime conveyances and illegal air flights. 
In response, the United States launched the Central America Regional 
Security Initiative (CARSI) in 2008, which was further expanded when I 
announced the Central America Citizen Security Partnership in San 
Salvador in March 2011. Through CARSI and the Partnership, the United 
States has focused its crime prevention, counternarcotics, law 
enforcement and security assistance, and bolstered rule of law 
institutions in Central America. The region also has strengthened 
cooperation through the Central American Integration System (SICA) to 
promote citizen security and other programs. Multilateral cooperation to 
stem the flow of precursor chemicals from as far away as China that are 
used to produce illegal methamphetamine in Central America is an 
important component of SICA's unprecedented regional cooperation. 
Similar objectives are achieved through U.S. support for Mexico's drug 
control policies and programs under the Merida Initiative.
Several other countries were evaluated for inclusion in this year's 
list, but are not determined to be major drug transit and/or major 
illicit drug producing countries. For example, Canada has taken 
effective steps to stem the flow of synthetic MDMA (ecstasy) across its 
shared border with the United States, a problem of growing concern 
during the past several years. The country continues its robust efforts 
to combat the production, distribution, and consumption of various 
illegal drugs. As part of its 5-year National Anti-Drug Strategy, Canada 
has rolled out new initiatives specifically intended to fight the 
trafficking of marijuana and synthetic drugs. As detailed in the March 
2011 report on precursors by the International Narcotics Control Board, 
Canada broadened its existing Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to 
prohibit any person from possessing, producing, selling, or importing 
material intended to be used in the illegal manufacture or trafficking 
of methamphetamine or ecstasy. The United States has also collaborated 
with Canada on a National Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy that 
defines in detail the wide range of initiatives underway to combat all 
phases of drug trafficking. Bilateral initiatives focus on programs to 
stem the two-way drug trade between Canada and the United States.
You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this determination, 
with its Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela memoranda of justification, under 
section 706 of the FRAA, to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal 
Register.

Order of September 28, 2012

Regarding the Acquisition of Four U.S. Wind Farm Project Companies by 
Ralls Corporation

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 721 of the 
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (section 721), 50 U.S.C. App. 
2170,
Section 1. Findings. I hereby make the following findings:
    (a) There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Ralls 
Corporation (Ralls), a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware, 
and its subsidiaries, and the Sany Group (which includes Sany Electric 
and Sany Heavy Industries), a Chinese company affiliated with Ralls 
(together, the Companies); and, Mr. Dawei Duan (Mr. Duan) and Mr. 
Jialing Wu (Mr. Wu), citizens of the People's Republic of China and 
senior executives of the Sany Group, who together own Ralls; through 
exercising control of Lower Ridge Windfarm, LLC, High Plateau Windfarm, 
LLC, Mule Hollow Windfarm, LLC, and Pine City Windfarm, LLC 
(collectively, the Project Companies), all limited liability companies 
organized under the laws of Oregon, might take action that threatens to 
impair the national security of the United States; and
    (b) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my 
judgment, provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect 
the national security in this matter.
Sec. 2. Actions Ordered and Authorized. On the basis of the findings set 
forth in section 1 of this order, considering the factors described in 
subsection 721(f), as appropriate, and pursuant to my authority under 
applicable law, including section 721, I hereby order that:
    (a) The transaction resulting in the acquisition of the Project 
Companies and their assets by the Companies or Mr. Wu or Mr. Duan is 
hereby prohibited, and ownership by the Companies or Mr. Wu or Mr. Duan 
of any interest in the Project Companies and their assets, whether 
directly or indirectly through owners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, is 
prohibited.
    (b) In order to effectuate this order, Ralls shall divest all 
interests in:

  (i) the Project Companies;

  (ii) the Project Companies' assets, intellectual property, technology, 
personnel, and customer contracts; and

  (iii) any operations developed, held, or controlled, whether directly or 
indirectly, by the Project Companies at the time of, or since, their 
acquisition not later than 90 days after the date of this order, unless 
such date is extended for a period not to exceed three (3) months, on such 
written conditions as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United 
States (CFIUS) may require. Immediately upon divestment, Ralls shall 
certify in writing to CFIUS that such divestment has been effected in 
accordance with this order.

    (c) No later than 14 calendar days from the date of this order, the 
Companies shall:

[[Page 410]]

  (i) remove from the properties on which the Companies have proposed to 
construct wind farms (including alternate sites) that are identified in the 
notice filed with CFIUS (Properties) all items, structures, or other 
physical objects or installations of any kind (including concrete 
foundations) that the Companies or persons on behalf of the Companies have 
stockpiled, stored, deposited, installed, or affixed thereon; and

  (ii) provide CFIUS with a statement signed by Mr. Duan and Mr. Wu 
certifying that the Companies have completed such removal.

    (d) The Companies, and any persons acting for or on behalf of the 
Companies, including officers, employees, and owners, shall cease all 
access, and will not have any access, to the Properties. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, individuals that are U.S. citizens contracted by the 
Companies and approved by CFIUS may access the Properties solely for 
purposes of fulfilling the requirements of subsection (c) of this 
section.
    (e) The Companies, Mr. Duan, and Mr. Wu shall not sell or otherwise 
transfer, or propose to sell or otherwise transfer, or otherwise 
facilitate the sale or transfer of, any items made or otherwise produced 
by the Sany Group to any third party for use or installation at the 
Properties.
    (f) Ralls shall not complete a sale or transfer of the Project 
Companies or their assets to any third party until:

  (i) all items, structures, or other physical objects or installations of 
any kind (including concrete foundations) that the Companies or persons on 
behalf of the Companies have stockpiled, stored, deposited, installed, or 
affixed on the Properties have been removed from the Properties and the 
Department of Defense has notified the Companies that it has verified the 
Companies' certification of such removal provided pursuant to subsection 
(c) of this section;

  (ii) Ralls notifies CFIUS in writing of the intended recipient or buyer; 
and

  (iii) Ralls has not received a provisional or final objection from CFIUS 
to the intended recipient or buyer within 10 business days of the 
notification in subsection f(ii) of this section. Among the factors CFIUS 
may consider in reviewing the proposed sale or transfer are whether the 
buyer or transferee: is a U.S. citizen or is owned by U.S. citizens; has or 
has had a direct or indirect contractual, financial, familial, employment, 
or other close and continuous relationship with the Companies or Project 
Companies, or their officers, employees, or owners; and can demonstrate a 
willingness and ability to support compliance with this order.

    (g) From the date of this order until Ralls provides a certification 
of divestment to CFIUS pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the 
Companies shall certify to CFIUS on a monthly basis that they are in 
compliance with this order.
    (h) Without limitation on the exercise of authority by any agency 
under other provisions of law, and until such time as the divestment is 
completed and verified to the satisfaction of CFIUS, CFIUS is authorized 
to implement measures it deems necessary and appropriate to verify that 
operations of the Project Companies are carried out in such a manner as 
to ensure protection of the national security interests of the United 
States. Such measures may include but are not limited to the following: 
on reasonable notice to the Project Companies and the Companies, 
employees of the United States

[[Page 411]]

Government, as designated by CFIUS, shall be permitted access, for 
purposes of verifying compliance with this order, to all premises and 
facilities of the Project Companies and the Companies located in the 
United States:

  (i) to inspect and copy any books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, 
memoranda, and other records and documents in the possession or under the 
control of the Companies or the Project Companies that concern any matter 
relating to this order;

  (ii) to inspect any equipment and technical data (including software) in 
the possession or under the control of the Companies or the Project 
Companies; and

  (iii) to interview officers, employees, or agents of the Companies or the 
Project Companies concerning any matter relating to this order.

CFIUS shall conclude its verification procedures within 90 days after 
the divestment is completed.

  (i) The Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to 
enforce this order.

Sec. 3. Revocation of Prior Orders. CFIUS's Order Establishing Interim 
Mitigation Measures of July 25, 2012, and Amended Order Establishing 
Interim Mitigation Measures of August 2, 2012, are hereby revoked.
Sec. 4. Reservation. I hereby reserve my authority to issue further 
orders with respect to the Companies or the Project Companies as shall 
in my judgment be necessary to protect the national security.
Sec. 5. Publication and Transmittal.
    (a) This order shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) I hereby direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transmit a copy 
of this order to the appropriate parties named in section 1 of this 
order.

determinations and authorize the following actions:

[[Page 412]]

The admission of up to 70,000 refugees to the United States during 
Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is 
otherwise in the national interest, provided that this number shall be 
understood as including persons admitted to the United States during FY 
2013 with Federal refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian 
immigrant admissions program, as provided below.
The 70,000 admissions numbers shall be allocated among refugees of 
special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the 
following regional allocations (provided that the number of admissions 
allocated to the East Asia region shall include persons admitted to the 
United States during FY 2013 with Federal refugee resettlement 
assistance under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988, as contained 
in section 101(e) of Public Law 100-202 (Amerasian immigrants and their 
family members)):


 
 
 
Africa                                     12,000
East Asia                                  17,000

admissions in regions where the need for additional admissions arises.
Additionally, upon notification to the Judiciary Committees of the 
Congress, you are further authorized to transfer unused admissions 
allocated to a particular region to one or more other regions, if there 
is a need for greater admissions for the region or regions to which the 
admissions are being transferred. Consistent with section 2(b)(2) of the 
Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, I hereby 
determine that assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for 
admission to the United States as part of the overseas refugee 
admissions program will contribute to the foreign policy interests of 
the United States and designate such persons for this purpose.
Consistent with section 101(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)), 
and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I also specify 
that, for FY 2013, the following persons may, if otherwise qualified, be

Provision of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Brazil, that (1) interdiction 
of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in illicit drug 
trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary because of the 
extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the national 
security of that country; and (2) that country has appropriate 
procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life in the air 
and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which shall at a 
minimum include effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before 
the use of force is directed against the aircraft.

Notice of October 17, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant 
Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant 
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia and the extreme level of 
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States 
and abroad.
Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of

[[Page 415]]

the United States and cause an extreme level of violence, corruption, 
and harm in the United States and abroad, the national emergency 
declared on October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto 
to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 21, 
2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers 
centered in Colombia.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of October 24, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Situation in 
or in Relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo

On October 27, 2006, by Executive Order 13413, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), ordered related 
measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the 
conflict in that country. The President took this action to deal with 
the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States constituted by the situation in or in relation to the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, which has been marked by widespread violence and 
atrocities that continue to threaten regional stability.
Because this situation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared on October 27, 2006, and the measures adopted on that 
date to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 
27, 2012. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13413.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of November 1, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan

On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Sudan and, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), took 
related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the 
actions and policies of the Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, in 
Executive Order 13400, the President determined that the conflict in 
Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, expanded the 
scope of the national emergency to deal with that threat, and ordered 
the blocking of property of certain persons connected to the conflict. 
On October 13, 2006, the President issued Executive Order 13412 to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency and to implement 
the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344).
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
November 3, 1997, as expanded on April 26, 2006, and with respect to 
which additional steps were taken on October 13, 2006, must continue in 
effect beyond November 3, 2012. Therefore, consistent with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Sudan.
    This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of November 1, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Weapons of Mass 
Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such 
weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13094 
amending Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the 
worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation 
activities. On June 28, 2005, the President issued Executive Order 13382 
which, inter alia, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our 
ability to combat proliferation. The proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means of

[[Page 417]]

delivering them continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States; 
therefore, the national emergency first declared on November 14, 1994, 
and extended in each subsequent year, must continue. In accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
12938, as amended.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of November 9, 2012

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran and, pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), took 
related steps to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the situation in Iran. Because our relations with Iran 
have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing the 
agreements with Iran, dated January 19, 1981, is still under way, the 
national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, must continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 2012. Therefore, consistent with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year this national emergency with respect to Iran.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of November 21, 2012

Waiver From Rescission of Unobligated Funds Under the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009

Consistent with the authority provided to me under the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), as amended by section 
1306 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(Public Law 111-203) (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), I have determined that it 
is not in the best interest of the Nation to rescind after December 31, 
2012,

[[Page 418]]

the unobligated amounts made available in Division A of the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act with respect to the accounts with the 
following Treasury Account Fund Symbol codes and names: 13-0110: DOC--
Office of the Inspector General; 86-0190: HUD--Office of Inspector 
General; 69-0131: DOT--Office of Inspector General; 20-0135: TREAS--
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration; 49-0301: NSF--Office 
of the Inspector General; and 73-0201: SBA--Office of Inspector General.
My determination is based on the following considerations:
The requesting Inspectors General are tasked with overseeing 
investigations that can take multiple years to complete, and the 
oversight work often begins in earnest during the final phases of a 
project. In some cases, the awards that the Inspectors General oversee 
will continue to outlay past December 31, 2012. The $11.5 million 
unobligated balance will allow Inspectors General the needed flexibility 
to effectively combat waste, fraud, and abuse.
Therefore, in accordance with section 1306 of the Dodd-Frank Act, I am 
waiving the requirements for repayment of unobligated funds made 
available in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act with respect to 
the accounts described above.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register.

    Pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 7(a) 
of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-45) (the ``Act''), 
I hereby determine that it is necessary, in order to protect the

of the Act.
    You are authorized and directed to transmit this determination to 
the Congress, accompanied by a report in accordance with section 7(a) of 
the Act, and to publish the determination in the Federal Register.
    This suspension shall take effect after the transmission of this 
determination and report to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 2013-3 of December 7, 2012

Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012

Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the Treasury[, 
and] the Secretary of Energy
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, after carefully considering the report 
submitted to the Congress by the Energy Information Administration on 
October 25, 2012, and other relevant factors, including global economic 
conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, the level of 
spare capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves, I determine, 
pursuant to section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, Public Law 112-81, and 
consistent with my determinations of March 30, 2012, and June 11, 2012, 
that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products 
from countries other than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the 
volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or 
through foreign financial institutions.
I will closely monitor this situation to ensure that the market can 
continue to accommodate a reduction in purchases of petroleum and 
petroleum products from Iran.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum of December 21, 2012

Federal Employee Pay Schedules and Rates That Are Set by Administrative 
Discretion

Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
On December 22, 2010, I issued a memorandum stating that the heads of 
executive departments and agencies should suspend any increases to any 
pay systems or pay schedules covering executive branch employees, and 
should forgo any general increases in covered employees' rates of pay, 
that could otherwise take effect as a result of the exercise of 
administrative discretion during the period beginning on January 1, 
2011, and ending on December 31, 2012. In light of section 114 of the 
Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013 (Public Law 112-175), I am 
hereby instructing the heads of executive departments and agencies that 
they should continue to adhere to this policy through March 27, 2013, 
the date after which statutory pay adjustments may be made pursuant to 
section 114 of Public Law 112-175.

[[Page 420]]

This memorandum shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law and 
consistent with executive departments' and agencies' legal authorities. 
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall issue any 
necessary guidance on implementing this memorandum, and is also hereby 
authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal 
Register.

Notice of December 28, 2012

Waiver From Rescission of Unobligated Funds Under the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009

Consistent with the authority provided to me under the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), as amended by section 
1306 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(Public Law 111-203), I have determined that it is not in the best 
interest of the Nation to rescind after December 31, 2012, the 
unobligated amounts made available in Division A of the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act with respect to the accounts with the 
following Treasury Account Fund Symbol codes and names, not to exceed 
the amounts stated:
Department of Defense: 97-0501--Military Construction, Defense-wide, 
$104 million;
Department of Energy: 89-0209--Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan 
Guarantee Program, $96 million;
Social Security Administration: 28X8704--Limitation on Administrative 
Expenses, $148 million; and
Small Business Administration: 73-4268--Surety Bond Guarantees Revolving 
Fund, $15 million.
My determination is based on the following consideration:
The retention of these unobligated balances will allow the executive 
agencies to continue to execute projects vital to the national interest 
in a fiscally responsible manner.
Therefore, in accordance with section 1306 of Public Law 111-203, I am 
waiving the requirements for repayment for the stated amounts of 
unobligated funds made available in the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act with respect to the accounts described above.
In accordance with section 1603(b) of the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, as added by section 1306 of Public Law 111-
203, all

[[Page 421]]

amounts that are rescinded pursuant to section 1603(b) shall be returned 
to the General Fund of the Treasury where such amounts shall be 
dedicated for the sole purpose of deficit reduction and prohibited from 
use as an offset for other spending increases or revenue reductions.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register.

Sec.  102.130  General prohibitions against discrimination.

    (a) No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may 
not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, 
on the basis of handicap--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified individual with handicaps an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;

benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal 
opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to 
reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps

that are as effective as those provided to others;
    (v) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate as a member of planning or advisory boards;

arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose 
or effect of which would--
    (i) Subject qualified individuals with handicaps to discrimination

    (6) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification 
program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with handicaps 
to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish 
requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified 
entities that subject qualified individuals with handicaps to 
discrimination on the basis of handicap. However, the programs or 
activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are 
not, themselves, covered by this regulation.

Sec.  102.140  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec.  102.141-102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec.  102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec.  102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec.  102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec.  102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 431]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec.  102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec.  102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec.  102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

Sec.  102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec.  102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

section applies to all allegations of discrimination on the basis of 
handicap in programs and activities conducted by the agency.
    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

Executive Office of the President, shall be responsible for coordinating 
implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to the Director 
at the following address: Room 486, Old Executive Office Building, 17th 
and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.

[[Page 433]]

    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec.  102.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for
