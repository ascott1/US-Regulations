                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 1997 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new Compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 1997 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 6966 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 1997 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
  abbreviated citation for Section 100.735-1, appearing in Chapter I of 
                                      this book, is ``3 CFR 100.735-1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  1998, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
     statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
 Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
Division by Anna Glover, Carolyn Wood Hill, John S. Ashlin, Maxine Hill, 
                                                        and Brad Brooks.

Proclamation 6966 of January 16, 1997

Religious Freedom Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Every day, in neighborhoods and communities across our Nation, Americans 
come together to worship and to reaffirm their most deeply held 
spiritual values. Our right to worship freely--each in our own way--is 
essential to our well-being. Religious Freedom Day offers us an 
invaluable opportunity to reflect on this precious human right and to 
give thanks for its protection in our Nation.
Freedom from religious persecution was of such profound importance to 
our founders that they placed it first among the freedoms guaranteed by 
the Bill of Rights. History has proved the wisdom of that decision. 
America's commitment to religious tolerance has empowered us to achieve 
an atmosphere of understanding, trust, and respect in a society of 
diverse cultures and religious traditions. And today, much of the world 
still looks to the United States as the champion of religious liberty.
Yet, even in America, we must be ever vigilant in protecting the 
freedoms so important to our ancestors and so admired by people 
throughout the world. The church arsons and the desecration of 
synagogues and mosques in recent years demonstrated for us all that our 
country is not entirely free from violence and religious hatred. My 
Administration took quick and decisive action, including working with 
the Congress to help churches rebuild and to prevent future incidents. 
And I am pleased that the American people are coming together as a 
national community to speak out against such crimes and to renew the 
climate of trust and tolerance so that all our people can worship 
without fear.

[[Page 2]]

We must also support the aspirations of ethnic and religious minorities 
in other nations as they strive for their own right to worship freely. 
My Administration has established the Advisory Committee on Religious 
Freedom Abroad to provide counsel on how best to prevent persecution and 
promote reconciliation among people of different faiths. I invite all 
nations to join us in supporting individuals in houses of worship around 
the world as they exercise one of the most sacred of human rights.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 1997, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge 
them to reaffirm their commitment to the principle of religious freedom.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 6967 of January 17, 1997

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

People throughout the world celebrate the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., as a tribute to his shining example of love and justice.
Dr. King was a man of clear and powerful vision who offered an 
uncompromising message of brotherhood and hope at a time when violence 
and racial intolerance tore at the seams of our Nation. In addressing 
these ills, he often referred to what he called the ``magnificent 
words'' of the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed that ``all 
men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the 
pursuit of Happiness.'' He declared these words to be ``a promissory 
note to which every American was to fall heir,'' and upon which payment 
could no longer be delayed. Dr. King's struggle made it possible for all 
of us to move closer to the ideals set forth in the Declaration of 
Independence and in our Constitution.
Although ours is the most successful multiracial, multicultural society 
in human history, in the words of Dr. King, ``our work is not yet 
done.'' We have not yet fully realized Dr. King's dream of a Nation of 
full opportunity, genuine equality, and consistent fair play for all.
Every citizen must rise to meet that challenge because America's promise 
of freedom and opportunity cannot truly be realized for any of us until 
it is realized for every one of us. We all have an obligation to reach 
out to one another--across the artificial barriers of race, gender, 
religion, class, and age--so that each member of our society shares 
fully in the promise of the American Dream.

[[Page 3]]

In the spring of 1963, Dr. King was arrested in Birmingham, Alabama, 
while protesting discrimination in public accommodations and employment. 
From his jail cell, he wrote of his faith that ultimately what was good 
in America would prevail over fear and prejudice:

  We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the 
nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned 
though we may be, our destiny is tied up with the destiny of America. . 
. . We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation 
and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands.

As I begin my second term as the last President of the 20th century, I 
ask each American to work with me to usher in a new era of hope, 
reconciliation, and fellowship among all our people--rich and poor, 
young and old, and men and women of every race. I urge all Americans to 
put intolerance behind us, seek common ground, and strive for justice 
and community in our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 20, 1997, 
as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I call upon the people 
of the United States to observe this occasion with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  

<R05>
Proclamation 6968 of January 20, 1997

National Day of Hope and Renewal, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Today as we celebrate the last Presidential Inauguration of the 20th 
century and raise our sights with hope and humility toward the 
challenges of a new age, let us together ask God's guidance and 
blessing.
This day marks not a personal or political victory but the triumph of a 
free people who have freely chosen the course our country will take as 
we prepare for the 21st century.
During the past 4 years, we have grown together as a people and as a 
Nation. Touched by tragedy, strengthened by achievement, exhilarated by 
the challenges and opportunities ahead, we have come a long way on our 
journey to change America's course for the better. We have always been a 
people of hope--hope that we can make tomorrow brighter than today, hope 
that we can fulfill our Nation's enduring promise of freedom and 
oppor-


[[Page 4]]

tunity. And we have always known that, by the grace of God and our 
mutual labor, we can make our hopes reality.
Today, we live in an age of possibility--a moment of rich opportunity 
that brings with it a deep responsibility for the future and the 
generations to come. We must seize this special moment with a commitment 
to do right by those who will follow us in this blessed land.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose life and vision we honor today, 
recognized that the destiny of each American is bound to the destiny of 
all Americans; that if we are to go forward, we must go forward 
together. So, let us pledge today to continue our national journey 
together. Let us reaffirm our commitment to our shared values of family 
and faith, work and opportunity. And let us resolve to work together, 
one Nation under God, to build a bridge of hope and renewal to a new 
American century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, do hereby proclaim January 20, 1997, a National Day 
of Hope and Renewal, and I call upon the citizens of this great Nation 
to observe this day by reflecting on their obligations to one another 
and to our beloved country and by facing the future with a spirit of 
hope and renewal.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6969 of January 27, 1997

To Modify Application of Duty-Free Treatment of Certain Articles Under 
the Generalized System of Preferences, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended by 
Public Law 104-88; 110 Stat. 1755, 1922 (``the 1974 Act''), the 
President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-
free treatment accorded under section 501 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2461) with respect to any article. With due regard for the factors set 
forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 
2462(c)), I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the 
application of duty-free treatment under title V of the 1974 Act for 
certain articles, including certain goods previously eligible for such 
treatment that the Customs Service has reclassified.
2. Presidential Proclamation 6961 of November 28, 1996, provided import 
relief with respect to certain broom corn brooms. For certain 
subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) 
established to carry out this relief, provisions were omitted that would 
have continued

[[Page 5]]

staged reductions of special rates of duty for the goods 
concerned, previously proclaimed pursuant to section 201(a) of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3331(a)). 
Further, other HTS provisions established by that proclamation contain 
conflicting dates that complicate their administration. To rectify these 
omissions and to permit proper administration of the import relief, I 
have decided that it is necessary and appropriate to continue previously 
proclaimed duty treatment for the affected goods and to make technical 
corrections in certain HTS provisions.
3. Section 213 of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, as amended 
(CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2703), and section 204 of the Andean Trade Preference 
Act (ATPA) (19 U.S.C. 3203) authorize the President to provide duty-free 
entry for all eligible articles, and duty reductions for certain other 
articles, that are the product of any country that has been designated 
as a beneficiary country under those Acts. To clarify the preferential 
tariff treatment provided to particular dutiable goods that are the 
product of beneficiary countries under the CBERA or the ATPA and that 
are eligible to enter under HTS heading 9802.00.80, which provides for 
certain goods assembled abroad using components of U.S. origin, I have 
decided it is appropriate to provide special rates of duty for purposes 
of the CBERA and of the ATPA in heading 9802.00.80 to apply to such 
goods.
4. Presidential Proclamation 6948 of October 29, 1996, modified tariff 
provisions concerning special import quotas for upland cotton. That 
proclamation also modified certain provisions of the HTS and of prior 
Presidential proclamations to correct technical errors and to clarify 
the intent of previously proclaimed modifications. In proclaiming the 
modifications to the provisions on upland cotton, a conforming change to 
U.S. note 6 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS was omitted. 
Further, the instructions in section A(5)(c) of Annex II to such 
proclamation concerning modifications to subchapter IV of chapter 99 to 
the HTS contained an error. To rectify the omission and to correct the 
error in instructions, I have decided it is necessary and appropriate to 
modify U.S. note 6 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS and to 
amend the instructions in section A(5)(c) of Annex II to Proclamation 
6948.
5. Presidential Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented with 
respect to the United States the trade agreements resulting from the 
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including Schedule 
XX--United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994. A conforming change in a 
subheading in subchapter V of chapter 99 of the HTS was omitted from 
Proclamation 6763. Further, particular HTS additional U.S. notes 
implementing tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for specified agricultural 
products do not clearly reflect the intended quota periods and the 
quantities permitted entry during such quota periods and have caused 
administrative difficulties. In order to make the necessary conforming 
change and to correct the legal notes controlling such TRQs, I have 
decided it is necessary and appropriate to modify a subheading in 
subchapter V of chapter 99 and the legal notes pertaining to such TRQs.
6. Presidential Proclamation 6857 of December 11, 1995, implemented with 
respect to the United States certain modifications to the HTS, in 
conformity with the obligations of the United States under the 
International Conven-

[[Page 6]]

tion on the Harmonized Commodity Description and 
Coding System. The Annex to that proclamation omitted provisions that 
would have continued previously proclaimed staged reductions of certain 
rates of duty for the goods concerned, pursuant to section 111(a) of the 
Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3521(a)). To rectify 
these omissions, I have decided that it is necessary and appropriate to 
provide for the continuation of previously proclaimed duty treatment for 
the affected goods.
7. (a) Section 115 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3524) requires the President 
to (1) obtain advice regarding certain proposed actions; (2) submit a 
report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate; and (3) 
consult with those Committees on the proposed action during a subsequent 
60-day period to meet the consultation and layover requirements of that 
section.
    (b) Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), 
authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the 
relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import 
treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.

8. I have decided that it is appropriate to authorize the United States 
Trade Representative (USTR) to perform the functions specified in 
section 115 of the URAA and certain functions under section 604 of the 
1974 Act.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 503 
of the 1974 Act, section 213 of the CBERA, section 204 of the ATPA, 
section 604 of the 1974 Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to reflect in the HTS various technical and conforming 
changes, to correct provisions of Proclamations 6948 and 6961, and to 
modify the special duty rates subcolumn for heading 9802.00.80, the HTS 
and Proclamations 6948 and 6961 are each modified as set forth in 
Annexes I and II to this proclamation.
    (2) In order to modify the application of duty-free treatment under 
title V of the 1974 Act for certain articles, the HTS is modified as set 
forth in Annex III to this proclamation.
    (3) The modifications to the HTS made by Annexes I, II, and III to 
this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set 
forth in such Annexes and during the time periods specified therein.
    (4) The USTR is authorized to perform the functions vested in the 
President under section 115 of the URAA. In addition, the USTR is 
authorized to exercise the authority provided to the President under 
section 604 of the 1974 Act to embody rectifications, technical or 
conforming changes, or similar modifications in the HTS.
    (5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 

[[Page 7]]


and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-first.

Proclamation 6970 of January 30, 1997

National African American History Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

For much of the past century, the contributions that African Americans 
and other minorities have made to our Nation's progress were not fully 
recognized. African American History Month is an important means by 
which we help right that wrong. It awakens our collective social 
conscience to the importance of giving all of our children a complete 
and accurate record of their country's history. And, perhaps most 
important, it helps to reinforce America's highest ideals--our respect 
for diversity, community, and freedom.
During this time of celebration and learning we are inspired by the 
courage, wisdom, and vision of men and women such as Frederick Douglass, 
Harriet Tubman, Carter G. Woodson, and Fannie Lou Hamer. These great 
Americans dedicated their lives to ensuring that the ideals of freedom 
and equality are guaranteed to all. Their noble efforts--and the efforts 
of those they inspired--renewed the spirit of our founding creed: ``All 
men are created equal.'' As we approach the 21st century, it is more 
vital than ever that we remain vigilant in protecting the ideals these 
visionary leaders fought so hard to uphold. We must continue to extend 
the circle of equality, justice, and opportunity until it embraces every 
American.
As we pay homage to our past, throughout the month of February and all 
year long, let us, with enlightened minds and emboldened hearts, 
continue the legacy of the civil rights movement. Let us present a 
diverse but united front to those who would reverse the vital progress 
that has been made. As the world's beacon of hope and freedom, let us 
approach the new millennium keeping this vigil.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 1997 as National 
African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs that raise 
awareness of African American history.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6971 of February 1, 1997

American Heart Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

More than 700,000 men and women die each year of heart disease, making 
it the leading cause of death in our country. Annually, about 1.5 
million Americans suffer heart attacks, one-third of which are fatal. 
Collectively, diseases of the heart and blood vessels claim about 
960,000 American lives annually. These statistics only hint at the 
individual and collective tragedy brought on by heart disease and stroke 
and underscore the need for us to do everything possible to combat 
cardiovascular diseases.
Research has brought dramatic improvements to our knowledge of heart 
disease and how to combat it. We have learned much in recent years and 
now know that the processes leading to heart disease typically begin 
early in life and worsen over the years; symptoms often do not appear 
for decades. We also better understand the effects of genetics, gender, 
and lifestyle. High blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, smoking, 
diabetes, and obesity increase the risk of developing heart disease; 
physical activity can reduce the risk of suffering from cardiovascular 
disease, including stroke.
Additionally, research has brought improved diagnostic methods and 
treatments for those afflicted with heart disease. Noninvasive imaging 
devices can now show the heart at work inside the body, giving doctors 
more precise information about their patient's condition. And new tests 
and therapies allow us to detect and treat a heart attack more 
effectively and minimize damage to the heart muscle.
These striking developments in biomedical techniques and increased 
public awareness and education have helped reduce the death rate from 
heart disease by nearly 60 percent in the past 30 years, and deaths from 
stroke by about 65 percent.
The Federal Government has contributed to these advances by supporting 
research and public education programs of the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. The American 
Heart Association also has played a crucial role in bringing about these 
remarkable accomplishments through its research and education programs 
and the work of dedicated volunteers.
Yet much remains to be done. The incidence of obesity has risen 
dramatically over the past 30 years, and renewed efforts are needed to 
make all Americans aware of how they can lower the risks of heart 
disease by adopting a commonsense regimen of diet, exercise, and, in 
some cases, medication.
More, too, must be done to help survivors of initial heart attacks live 
full lives. Within six years of a heart attack, for instance, more than 
a third of those afflicted develop severe and often disabling chest 
pain. One-fourth or more of them will have another heart attack, and 
another fifth suffer heart failure. The challenges posed by heart 
disease are becoming ever more pressing as America ages and more of us 
live beyond age 65--the group most affected by this disease.


[[Page 20]]

In the face of these daunting challenges, we Americans, acting 
individually and collectively, can fight heart disease and give 
ourselves and our families a healthy future.
In recognition of these important needs in the ongoing battle against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 169b), has requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation designating February as 
``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 1997, as American Heart Month. I 
invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, and the American people to join me in reaffirming our commitment 
to combating cardiovascular disease and stroke.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6972 of February 8, 1997

National Child Passenger Safety Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Children are our Nation's most precious gift, and one of our most 
profound responsibilities is protecting their health, well-being, and 
safety. Nowhere is this duty more critical than on America's streets and 
highways.
Automobile accidents are the leading cause of death for America's young 
people. It is tragic that a high proportion of these deaths could be 
prevented, but are not. For example, we know that seat belts save 
lives--last year they prevented the deaths of almost 10,000 Americans--
and, yet, many still fail to wear them.
I encourage all Americans to take a few simple steps to ensure that 
their families travel safely. The most important rule is also the 
simplest: The safest place for children is the back seat. Also, parents 
and guardians must always make sure that children are secured, either in 
a locked seat belt or in an appropriate child safety seat.
I commend the Department of Transportation for its ``Patterns for Life'' 
program, begun in 1996 to focus attention on correct child safety seat 
use and the proper positioning of children and their safety seats away 
from air bags. Working through national safety organizations and State 
public safety and highway offices, this program offers a network of 
qualified child passenger safety trainers to provide communities with 
the valuable resources they need to reduce motor vehicle-related deaths 
and injuries.
Laws exist in every State and the District of Columbia that require 
proper restraints for younger children. However, 40 percent of our 
children under 

[[Page 21]]

five are still not properly restrained. We must do better 
to enforce the existing laws and protect our precious cargo.
The steps we take now will make our roads safer and our children more 
secure. My Administration is striving to increase the use of seat belts 
throughout the Nation. We are also working with automobile makers, car 
dealers, private organizations, and insurance companies to teach parents 
how to install child safety seats properly, and new technologies will 
eventually make air bags safer for children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 9 through 
February 15, 1997, as National Child Passenger Safety Week. I urge all 
Americans to help reduce injuries and the tragic loss of life on our 
highways by buckling up every child in an approved restraint, in the 
vehicle's back seat. And let us all help spread these important child 
safety messages throughout our communities. By doing so, we can save 
many young lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  

<R05>
Proclamation 6973 of February 24, 1997

American Red Cross Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Founded over a century ago by Clara Barton, the American Red Cross has 
evolved from a branch of the International Red Cross into a uniquely 
American institution, serving our Nation in peace and in war, and 
through countless natural disasters. Since the Spanish-American War, 
when the first volunteers brought emergency first-aid and news from home 
to wounded soldiers, generations of Americans have followed in this 
grand tradition of service.
Today, in communities across our Nation, a million and a half volunteers 
stand ready to help their neighbors at a moment's notice. Last year, Red 
Cross paid and volunteer staff assisted disaster victims across the 
country by opening more than 3,200 shelters and giving comfort to 
172,000 people. The Red Cross also reached 16 million Americans through 
health and safety courses, including HIV and AIDS education and 
community outreach programs; collected more than 6 million units of 
lifesaving blood to keep our national blood supply ready, strong, and 
safe; and provided immediate counseling and support to the bereaved 
families of the victims of TWA Flight 800 and ValuJet Flight 592.
Overseas, American Red Cross workers provided emergency communications 
for our troops in Bosnia; worked with foreign Red Cross societies to 
rebuild the lives of civilian refugees in places such as the former 
Yugos-

[[Page 22]]

lavia and Rwanda; and provided personnel, financial aid, and gifts 
of goods and services to the victims of international disasters and 
armed conflicts in every corner of the globe.
Since 1881, the size, scope, and complexity of major disasters have 
placed an ever-greater demand on the resources of the Red Cross. Yet, 
the generosity of our citizens has enabled the American Red Cross to 
continue to fulfill its humanitarian mission, providing assistance to 
those in need and easing suffering around the world. We must continue 
this tradition, and, in the spirit of service, support this voluntary 
agency because it truly belongs to all Americans. Each of us can help 
keep the American Red Cross strong through our donations of time, money, 
and blood.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim March 1997 as American Red Cross Month. I 
urge all the people of the United States to support the humanitarian 
work of their local Red Cross chapters by volunteering and participating 
in Red Cross blood drives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6974 of February 27, 1997

Irish-American Heritage Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Throughout the history of the United States, from the founding of our 
republic to the modern spread of our cultural influence around the 
globe, American life has been enriched continuously by the contributions 
of Irish Americans.
Although thousands of immigrants from Ireland had already come to 
America before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the 
largest number emigrated from their homeland in the middle of the 19th 
century, when devastating famine overtook their native Ireland. Many 
moved into our cities, where their hard work helped American industries, 
their political skills energized local government, and their culture 
added richness to urban neighborhoods. Others, freshly arrived from 
Cork, Kilkenny, or Belfast, kept moving all the way to the American 
West. Wherever they went, they added their muscle to the building of our 
railroads, bridges, tunnels, and canals, and they applied their minds to 
the shaping of American law and letters. And their values were 
exemplified by a firm confidence in education, a dedication to the work 
ethic, and a deep belief in God.
America offered these new citizens abundant opportunities and the 
freedom to exercise their talents in a country that was still less than 
100 years

[[Page 23]]

old. In return, Ireland added immensely to the American 
national character. This month, when communities all across the Nation 
celebrate St. Patrick's Day, we honor the millions of Americans who 
trace their lineage to Ireland.
Our country has been blessed by the rich legacy of famous Americans 
whose ancestors emigrated to our shores from Ireland. Georgia O'Keefe, 
Edgar Allen Poe, and F. Scott Fitzgerald are just a few among the many 
whose talents have graced the arts. Andrew Mellon and Henry Ford 
excelled in business and finance. Will Rogers, Spencer Tracy, Bing 
Crosby, and John Wayne have entertained us. Pierce Butler signed the 
Constitution, General Douglas MacArthur led the Allied Forces in the 
Pacific during World War II, and Sandra Day O'Connor became the first 
woman to sit on our Supreme Court.
But let us not forget the sacrifices, dedication, and profound 
achievements of the thousands of less well-known Irish Americans who 
have labored to make the United States a country of which we all can be 
proud. They were--and continue to be--motivated by their deep commitment 
and fervent loyalty to family, friends, community, and country. This 
month we honor them and thank them for their efforts.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1997 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all the people of the United States 
to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-first.

Proclamation 6975 of March 3, 1997

Women's History Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Throughout the history of our Nation, women have played a pivotal role 
in bringing about positive change to every aspect of American life, and 
their achievements continue to touch the lives of every single citizen. 
Women's History Month honors the women who made these accomplishments 
possible, securing their rightful place in history among those who have 
made our country great. This month, we celebrate these women's lives--
and renew our commitment to breaking down the gender barriers that still 
exist.
Through their courage, foresight, and community spirit over the years, 
American women have created a world of opportunity for today's heroines 
and role models--women such as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, 

[[Page 24]]

the highest ranking woman to serve in any presidential administration; 
Dr. Shannon W. Lucid, who has performed five historic and complex Space 
Shuttle missions during 18 years with NASA and recently broke the 
American and women's world record for continuous time in space; Oseola 
McCarty, who in 1995 donated the life savings she had earned as a maid 
to fund scholarships at the University of Mississippi; and Julie Su, the 
young attorney who first came to prominence through her efforts to 
expose illegal exploitation of Thai immigrants in a California sweatshop 
and who continues to help immigrants to secure proper medical care, 
employment, and the dignity they deserve. The pioneers in women's 
history would be proud of today's women pioneers.
As we approach the 21st century, we have reached another significant 
milestone in our Nation's history: Women have approached an almost equal 
share in the labor force. Thus, it is more important than ever that we 
enable women and men to meet their responsibilities at work and at home.
Women continue to break the glass ceiling, changing their status from 
employee to employer. Today, women-owned businesses are creating one out 
of every four jobs in the United States. From the classroom to the board 
room, women now occupy every part of the work force, building the kinds 
of lives for themselves and their families that are the heart of the 
American Dream.
Women's History Month provides Americans with an opportunity to 
celebrate the contributions of all the women who have enriched our 
Nation, to honor their legacy, and to reflect upon what we can all do to 
end discrimination against women. I encourage all Americans to learn 
from, and share information about, women's history in their workplaces, 
classrooms, and family rooms. As every family has its own heroes, so 
does our country. Only by studying the history of America's women can we 
fully understand the history of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 1997, as 
Women's History Month. I ask educators, Government officials, and all 
citizens to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
and activities, remembering not only this month but also every month the 
many different contributions that women make every day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of March, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6976 of March 3, 1997

Save Your Vision Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Our eyes are our windows to the world. They give us the freedom to gaze 
at a sunset, read a book, or drive a car. Our sight allows us to jog 
along a garden pathway or enjoy a panoramic view.
All of us need to care for our vision, but older Americans in particular 
should be aware of their susceptibility to eye disease. As the ``baby 
boom'' generation ages, it is critical that these Americans receive 
regular eye examinations from eye-care professionals.
A thorough exam can lead to early detection and control or cure of eye 
diseases such as glaucoma, cataract, and diabetic retinopathy. A 
professional eye exam can also diagnose age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD), a leading cause of severe visual impairment and blindness in the 
United States. This common disease affects the retina, the part of the 
eye that helps to produce sharp, central vision required for activities 
such as reading and driving. AMD causes a loss of this clear, central 
vision; in some cases, vision loss is rapid and dramatic. The risk of 
AMD dramatically increases after age 60. It is estimated that this 
disease already causes visual impairment in approximately 1.7 million of 
the 34 million Americans now older than 65. As these numbers continue to 
grow, researchers are working to find the cause of, and develop 
treatment for, this debilitating disease.
People with AMD and its accompanying visual impairment often cannot 
perform daily activities such as reading the newspaper, preparing meals, 
or recognizing faces of friends. The inability to see well affects 
routine activities and social interactions and can lead to a loss of 
independence.
However, low-vision services and devices can greatly improve the quality 
of life for visually impaired patients and help them maintain their 
independence. Devices such as hand-held magnifiers, computer monitors 
with large type, and large-print newspapers and books can help the 
visually impaired dramatically improve their quality of life.
To remind Americans of the importance of protecting their eyesight, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 629; 
36 U.S.C. 169a), has authorized and requested the President to proclaim 
the first week in March of each year as ``Save Your Vision Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 2 through March 8, 1997, as Save Your 
Vision Week. Our eyes play a vital role in our independence and daily 
living and need to be examined regularly. Let us recognize the work done 
by vision researchers across our Nation on AMD and other eye diseases 
and the efforts they are making to enhance and retain our precious 
sight. Education on good vision starts with us, and we should take 
progressive steps to protect our eyes.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of March, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of

[[Page 26]]

the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 6977 of March 5, 1997

National Poison Prevention Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

This year, as we observe National Poison Prevention Week, we highlight 
two achievements: the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging 
required by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the 
lifesaving work of the Nation's poison control centers. These public 
health efforts have reduced childhood poisoning deaths from 450 deaths 
in 1961 to 50 deaths in 1993. However, according to the American 
Association of Poison Control Centers, over one million children each 
year are exposed to potentially poisonous medicines and household 
chemicals.
Virtually all poisonings are preventable, and we must continue to inform 
parents, grandparents, and caregivers how to prevent childhood 
poisonings. The Poison Prevention Week Council, a coalition of 39 
national organizations determined to stop accidental poisonings, 
distributes valuable information used by poison control centers, 
pharmacies, public health departments, and others to conduct poison 
prevention programs in their communities.
Simple safety measures--such as correctly using child-resistant 
packaging and keeping potentially harmful substances locked away from 
children--can save lives. And if a poisoning occurs, a poison control 
center can offer quick and lifesaving intervention.
The CPSC requires child-resistant packaging for many medicines and 
household chemicals. A recent CPSC study showed that every year 
approximately 24 children's lives are saved by child-resistant packaging 
for oral prescription medicines. The CPSC recently took action to ensure 
that child-resistant packaging will be easier for adults to use as well. 
This, in turn, will increase the use of child-resistant packaging, 
preventing more poisonings.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take more preventive measures, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681), has authorized 
and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the 
third week of March of each year as ``National Poison Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 16 through March 22, 1997, as National 
Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week 
by participating in appropriate ceremonies and activities and by 
learning how to prevent accidental poisonings among children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of March, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of

[[Page 27]]

the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 6978 of March 7, 1997

National Older Workers Employment Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

American workers age 55 and older represent one of our country's richest 
resources, and the value of their potential contribution to our society 
is immense. An estimated 70 percent of all Americans age 55 and older 
already actively contribute to our common good--by working, by 
volunteering, and by caring for sick and disabled relatives, friends, 
and neighbors.
Despite their qualifications, however, many of these Americans 
experience serious difficulty finding work if they lose a job or desire 
new employment. Their search for employment can become increasingly 
challenging as they grow older.
Our laws and government agencies can--and do--offer protections, 
programs, and services for older workers. The Age Discrimination Act, 
the Older Americans Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act 
all recognize the unique rights of such employees, and the Department of 
Labor alone helps thousands of workers each year through efforts such as 
the Senior Community Service Employment Program.
But it is up to employers also to recognize the potential of older 
Americans as employees--to recognize that by every common measure of job 
performance, older workers are as effective as younger people because of 
their unique skills, experiences, and judgment. And, it is appropriate 
that we designate a week to acknowledge that all workers should be 
judged and employed on the basis of their individual ability to do a 
job, regardless of age.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States, 
by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, do hereby proclaim March 9 through March 15, 1997, as 
National Older Workers Employment Week, and I urge all employers when 
they hire new workers to consider carefully the skills and other 
qualifications of men and women age 55 and older. I also encourage 
public officials responsible for job placement, training, and related 
services to intensify their efforts throughout the year to help older 
workers locate available jobs and training.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6979 of March 25, 1997

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Today, the Greek people and the Hellenic Republic will celebrate the 
176th anniversary of the beginning of their struggle for independence.
On this day, it is fitting that we reflect on the enormous contributions 
the Greek people have made to the modern world. The legacy of the 
ancient Greeks, in the fields of philosophy, literature, drama, 
sculpture, and architecture, continues to influence our beliefs, our 
values, and our concept of art. And, after more than 2,000 years, the 
ideology of Greece--as embodied in the concept of democracy--is still 
the ideal that guides us in charting our course for the future.
Greek ideology had a profound effect on our Founding Fathers, who molded 
the American form of government based upon the principles of Greek 
democracy. Thomas Jefferson studied the Greek classics in his youth and 
was inspired by their philosophy throughout his life, most dramatically 
when he crafted the Declaration of Independence. When formulating his 
vision for this country, Jefferson specifically referred to the 
integrated assertions, theories, and aims of the classic Greek world.
Our admiration for Greece continues into the modern day, and we salute 
its commitment to democracy, to peace, and to a united and stable 
Europe. We share a partnership with Greece in NATO, and our countries 
are linked forever by close family relationships between our peoples. 
Our Nation looks forward to working closely with Greece in the coming 
years as we examine ways to bring full peace, stability, and prosperity 
to all the nations of Europe and the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 1997, as Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6980 of April 1, 1997

Cancer Control Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

In observing Cancer Control Month, we reaffirm our national commitment 
to fighting this deadly disease. Since the signing of the National 
Cancer Act in 1971, we as a Nation have made significant strides in 
combating many forms of cancer. In November 1996, the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) announced that the cancer death rate in the United 
States fell by nearly 3 percent between 1991 and 1995, the first 
sustained decline since national record-keeping began in the 1930s. The 
declines in lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer deaths in men, and 
breast and gynecologic cancer deaths in women, reflect the progress we 
have made in prevention, early detection, and treatment. However, we 
recognize how much work must still be done to control and eliminate this 
disease.
Perhaps one of the most promising achievements of cancer research this 
past year is in our increased understanding of cancer genetics. We have 
learned that cancer is a disease of altered genes and altered gene 
function. Researchers are making great progress in identifying genes 
whose dysfunction leads to cancer. Our research into the relationship 
between genetics and cancer also is helping us to better understand the 
basis for many other diseases and will strengthen our ability to 
intervene against them. If we are to continue this remarkable progress, 
we must keep scientific research as a fundamental priority.
Research has already taught us that smoking directly causes lung cancer 
and markedly increases a person's risk of developing cancers of the 
pancreas, esophagus, uterus, cervix, mouth, throat, and bladder. We know 
that many of the deaths from these cancers are preventable. Over the 
last several years, positive trends have emerged: Business, industry, 
and all levels of government have established smoke-free policies, and 
per-capita cigarette consumption has declined by 37 percent over the 
past two decades.
Reasons for deep concern remain, however. More than 3,000 teenagers 
become regular smokers each day in the United States. We must do all we 
can to help our children understand the consequences of smoking, and we 
must set a good example ourselves by not smoking. Last year, in an 
important step forward, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed 
restrictions on the advertising, marketing, and sales of cigarettes to 
minors. In February of this year, I was proud to announce that the first 
part of those rules went into effect.
We are also learning more about the relationship between diet and cancer 
risk, and we are gaining insight into the role of dietary supplements in 
reducing certain types of cancer. We know that by improving our diet--
reducing fat and increasing the amount of fiber--we reduce our risk of 
cancer. The NCI, in collaboration with the food industry, sponsors the 
national 5-A-Day Program, which encourages Americans to eat five 
servings of fruit and vegetables each day.
We are taking other important steps, as well. Federal agencies are 
working together to ensure that potentially active drugs move quickly 
from discov-

[[Page 30]]

ery to clinical use. To reduce the number of cancer deaths 
and new cases, and to help cancer patients survive longer and live 
better lives, several Federal agencies are working with State and local 
health departments to develop and implement national plans for breast 
and cervical cancer screening and to promote cancer prevention. I was 
pleased to announce last week that my Administration is launching a 
major public education campaign to make sure that every woman and every 
health care professional in America is aware of the NCI's new 
recommendations that women between the ages of 40 and 49 should get a 
mammography examination for breast cancer every one or two years. The 
Medicare budget that I just submitted to the Congress will cover the 
expense of these annual exams, and we are urging State Medicaid 
directors to cover annual mammograms as well, with the assurance that 
the Federal Government will pay its matching share if they do so.
As we commemorate this special month, I ask health care professionals, 
private industry, community groups, insurance companies, and all other 
interested organizations and individual citizens to unite to publicly 
reaffirm our Nation's continuing commitment to controlling cancer. In 
1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution 
requesting the President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April 
as ``Cancer Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 1997, as Cancer Control Month. I 
invite the Governors of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and the appropriate 
officials of all other areas under the American flag to issue similar 
proclamations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6981 of April 1, 1997

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

We live in a Nation blessed with liberty and prosperity. Yet, many of 
our children still suffer the horrors of child abuse and neglect, 
knowing no happiness, and sometimes even losing their lives. And, it is 
a problem that grows worse. Last year, the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services reported that an estimated 3 million American children 
were abused or neglected, twice as many as 5 years earlier. Almost half 
a million of our children were seriously injured because of this 
mistreatment, quadruple the number from the previous report. Tragically, 
more than 1,100 abused children died last year--an incomprehensible 80 
percent of them at the hands of their own parents. We must not let this 
senseless suffering continue.


[[Page 31]]


My Administration is continuing its efforts to make our children safer. 
Already, we have developed new family-based prevention services to work 
with families at risk, and we have said to those who would prey on our 
children in public housing that one conviction for drug dealing or a 
violent crime will result in expulsion from public housing. We are 
working to establish a national registry for sexual predators, and we 
have preserved the Federal investment in child protective services so 
States have the resources to help children in danger. We have taken guns 
off the street by banning 19 deadly assault weapons, and we are putting 
100,000 more police officers on the streets to patrol our neighborhoods. 
And my Administration has developed a plan that aims, by the year 2002, 
to double the number of children placed in adoption or permanent 
placements from the public foster care system.
During this month of April, we pause to recognize and praise the work of 
those parents and other caretakers who see that the physical, mental, 
emotional, educational, and medical needs of our children are adequately 
met. I commend the efforts of the dedicated and compassionate men and 
women who assist families in crisis and enable these families to prevent 
child abuse. Without the commitment, knowledge, and skill of these men 
and women, many more children would find themselves the victims of abuse 
and the lives of many children who are abused and neglected would never 
improve. With their involvement, the lives of our most vulnerable 
children are immeasurably enriched. This month reminds us that every 
child is entitled to live his or her life to its fullest, free from fear 
and want. As Thomas Jefferson stated so eloquently, ``The Giver of life 
gave it for happiness and not for wretchedness.'' We hold our children's 
future in trust. Let us not fail them.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 1997 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month by demonstrating our respect and gratitude for those who devotedly 
and unselfishly work to keep children safe, by learning how we can help 
keep children from harm's way, and by taking responsible actions to 
protect our precious children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6982 of April 1, 1997

To Implement an Agreement To Eliminate Tariffs on Certain 
Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Intermediates

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

1. On December 13, 1996, members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
including the United States and 16 other major trading countries, 
announced in the WTO Singapore Ministerial Declaration an agreement to 
eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates 
that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during 
the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (``Uruguay 
Round''). In addition, it was agreed that the agreement on 
pharmaceutical products reached at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
and consequently Schedule XX--United States of America, annexed to the 
Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) 
(``Schedule XX'') erroneously included 25 products.
2. (a) Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 
U.S.C. 3521(b)) authorizes the President to proclaim the modification of 
any duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX 
for products that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination 
negotiations during the Uruguay Round if the United States agrees to 
such action in a multilateral negotiation under the auspices of the WTO 
and after compliance with the consultation and layover requirements of 
section 115 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3524). Section 111(b) also authorizes 
the President to proclaim such modifications as are necessary to correct 
technical errors in Schedule XX or to make other rectifications to the 
Schedule.
    (b) Section 111(a) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521(a)) authorizes the 
President to proclaim such additional duties as the President determines 
to be necessary or appropriate to carry out Schedule XX.

3. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (1974 Act), as amended (19 
U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
4. (a) Pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined that 
modifications to Schedule XX are necessary and that Schedule XX should 
be modified accordingly. In addition, I have determined to modify the 
HTS to implement the multilateral agreement on pharmaceuticals 
negotiated under the auspices of the WTO.
    (b) Pursuant to section 111(a) of the URAA, I have determined that 
it is necessary or appropriate to modify the HTS to increase tariffs on 
products that were included erroneously in the pharmaceuticals agreement 
reached at the end of the Uruguay Round.
    (c) On January 29, 1997, pursuant to section 115 of the URAA, the 
United States Trade Representative (USTR) submitted a report to the 
Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Finance of the Senate (``the Committees'') that set forth 
the pro-

[[Page 33]]

posed tariff eliminations and corrections in existing tariff 
treatment, together with the advice received from the appropriate 
private sector advisory committee and the U.S. International Trade 
Commission regarding such actions. During the 60-day period thereafter, 
the USTR consulted with the Committees on the proposed tariff 
eliminations and corrections.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 
111(a) and (b) of the URAA and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do hereby 
proclaim that:
    (1) In order to implement the multilateral agreement negotiated 
under the auspices of the WTO to eliminate tariffs on certain 
pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediates, and to correct 
errors, Schedule XX and the pharmaceutical appendix to the HTS are 
modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.
    (2) The modifications to the HTS set forth in this proclamation 
shall be effective as provided in the Annex to this proclamation.
    (3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6983 of April 8, 1997

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Throughout the annals of American military history, our men and women in 
uniform have placed themselves in great peril for the benefit of our 
Nation. Many of these courageous guardians of our freedoms have been 
held against their will as prisoners of war. The American people, 
including those now serving in our Armed Forces, continue to hold in the 
highest esteem these men and women who suffered the loss of their 
personal freedom and, in some instances, their lives.
Although there is no threat of a major conflict in our immediate future, 
we face continuing military challenges, and our Armed Forces still 
deploy ``in harm's way'' to maintain American interests and stability 
throughout the world. Whether attempting to keep the peace in Bosnia, 
evacuating American citizens from Albania, or patrolling the world's 
seas and skies, our service men and women risk capture by unfriendly 
foreign forces.
American prisoners of war have always proudly struggled for their 
freedom and have demonstrated a profound dedication to their country. 
Although international law, as set forth in the Geneva Convention, 
confers a protected status on prisoners of war, many Americans faced 
difficult conditions, including torture, but they persevered, taking 
comfort in their love of God, family, and country. We can never know the 
extent of the brutality and hardships many of them encountered, but we 
can express our sincere admiration for their courage and bravery.
As we observe National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, we honor 
and recognize all American service personnel who endured detention or 
captivity in the service of their Nation. We take comfort in knowing 
that despite enduring daily physical and mental trials, many survived 
and returned to productive lives at home. But we remember and pay homage 
and respect to those who made the ultimate sacrifice while in enemy 
hands. Today, we enjoy the freedoms that generations of American men and 
women have fought to defend. Let us extend to Americans who were 
prisoners of war, and to their families, our profound gratitude for 
their unselfish contribution to the preservation of our country. We will 
never forget.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 1997, as National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon all Americans to 
join in remembering former American prisoners of war who suffered the 
hardships of enemy captivity. I also call upon Federal, State, and local 
government officials and private organizations to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of
[[Page 46]]

 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

<R05>
Proclamation 6984 of April 9, 1997

National D.A.R.E. Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Today we honor Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.), the largest 
and most widely recognized substance abuse prevention and safety-
promotion curriculum in the Nation. First developed in 1983, D.A.R.E. 
has continued to improve its methods as research findings have increased 
our knowledge of effective substance abuse prevention among school-age 
youth. More than 70 percent of America's school districts have adopted 
the program, and over 8,000 cooperative partnerships between law 
enforcement agencies and school districts now exist across the country. 
By virtue of D.A.R.E.'s expansive use and national impact, this acronym 
has achieved broad name recognition in association with substance abuse 
prevention, making the D.A.R.E. officer one of the most recognizable 
symbols for community policing and prevention.
Students, parents, police officers, and school administrators have long 
been familiar with the benefits of the D.A.R.E. program, and research 
has shown that ongoing reinforcement of drug prevention skills is 
critical in decreasing the likelihood of drug use by our youth.
Today and throughout the year, let us recognize D.A.R.E. as a model of 
partnership between educators, law enforcement, parents, and students, 
and let us commend D.A.R.E. officers for their dedicated efforts to help 
educate the children of America about the importance of remaining drug 
free.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10, 1997, as 
National D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon our youth, parents, and educators, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 6985 of April 10, 1997

National Pay Inequity Awareness Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Although more than three decades have passed since the Equal Pay Act and 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act were signed into law, women working 
full-time and year round in the United States, on average, still earn 
only 71 percent of the wages earned by men. This means that, for the 
1996 calendar year, the wages of the average American female worker will 
not match those of the average male worker until April 11 of this year.
Although the pay gap has narrowed over the past two decades, unfair pay 
practices persist in many U.S. business sectors. Paying a woman less 
than a male co-worker with equal skills and job responsibilities hurts 
that woman and her family--not only in immediate material benefit, but 
also in her ability to invest and save for retirement. Working women 
deserve--and are demanding--fair and equal pay for their time spent on 
the job. Over a quarter of a million women surveyed by the Department of 
Labor indicated that ``improving pay scales'' is one of their highest 
priorities in bringing fairness to the workplace.
To address this problem, my Administration has moved on several fronts 
simultaneously: I signed the increase in the minimum wage into law, 
initiated a pension education campaign, strengthened equal employment 
law enforcement, and created a Women's Bureau Fair Pay Clearinghouse at 
the Department of Labor, which disseminates information on working 
women's wages and occupations and on organizations that are active in 
improving women's wages. In addition, my Administration, with over 200 
private-sector partners, has formed the American Savings Education 
Council to educate women and men on how they can ensure their financial 
independence in retirement. Together with renewed attention focused on 
the reality of pay inequity and what it means for working women across 
the country, these initiatives create real opportunities for employers, 
working women, and organizations to develop new and effective approaches 
that achieve pay equity.
Strong enforcement of equal employment laws also plays a critical role 
in resolving unfair pay. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
enforces laws that make it illegal to discriminate in wages, or to limit 
or segregate job applicants or employees in any way that would deprive 
them of opportunities because of sex, race, color, religion, age, 
national origin, or disability.
The Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 
enforces nondiscrimination and affirmative action laws that apply to 
employers that do business with the Federal Government, ensuring that 
Government contractors prevent and remedy discrimination and resolve 
matters of pay equity.
It is vital that we aggressively enforce our pay equity laws. Women 
deserve to be rewarded on an equal basis for their contributions to the 
American work force.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 11, 1997, 
as National Pay Inequity Awareness Day. I call upon Government 
officials, law enforcement agencies, business and industry leaders, 
educators, and all the people of the United States to recognize the full 
value of the skills and contributions of women in the labor force.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 6986 of April 11, 1997

National Service and Volunteer Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Citizen service is a vital force in American life, helping to build a 
stronger sense of community and citizenship and engaging Americans to 
meet the obligations we all share. Whether tutoring children, mentoring 
teens, renovating housing, restoring public parks, responding to natural 
disasters, or caring for aging parents and grandparents, those who serve 
and volunteer are strengthening our communities for America's future.
The era of big government may be over, but the era of big challenges for 
our Nation is surely not. Citizen service reflects one of the most basic 
convictions of our democracy: that we are all responsible for one 
another. It is a very American idea that we meet our challenges not 
through big government or as isolated individuals, but as members of a 
true community, with all of us working together.
Americans can take pride in knowing that our tradition of service is 
being preserved and expanded. As we recognize the devoted service of our 
Nation's citizens, we must continue to foster the spirit of 
volunteerism, making service the common expectation and experience of 
every American. Working together, we can respond to our shared problems 
and build a better future for the generations to come.
National Service and Volunteer Week is a time to celebrate the American 
spirit of service and volunteerism and a time to encourage citizens to 
use their individual talents to serve the common good. During this week 
and throughout the year, let us salute all those who devote their time, 
their talents, and their energy to improving our communities--through 
organizations like AmeriCorps and other programs within the Corporation 
for National Service; the Points of Light Foundation; Learn and Serve 
America; the National Senior Service Corps; and thousands of other 
voluntary, civic, religious, and neighborhood groups.
Later this month, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, we will convene 
an historic Presidents' Summit on Service. I will be joined there by 
every
[[Page 49]]

living former president, or his representative, and other 
prominent Americans as we take specific steps to serve our children and 
to rebuild our communities. Our mission is nothing less than to spark a 
renewed national sense of obligation, a new sense of duty, a new season 
of service.
I hope that the many related activities in the days leading up to this 
important event will make all Americans think about our shared 
responsibility for one another. Citizen service can take many shapes--it 
can mean joining AmeriCorps as a high school student, volunteering 
nights or on weekends in a religious group or neighborhood association, 
or devoting years of one's life to service in the Peace Corps or in the 
Jesuit Volunteer Corps.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of April 13 
through April 19, 1997, as National Service and Volunteer Week. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities to express appreciation for all those who 
serve and to encourage others to continue the American legacy of 
service.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6987 of April 11, 1997

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Each year, we pause to reflect on how the 34 free countries of the 
Western Hemisphere are inextricably linked to a shared vision through 
the common thread of democracy, free trade, and mutual respect. This 
vision can be achieved by continuing our efforts to create a hemispheric 
free trade area and by working together to uphold democracy, defend 
human rights, and defeat the scourge of narcotics trafficking.
The citizens of the Americas have made remarkable progress toward the 
advancement of democratic values and institutions, as well as the 
creation of integrated markets within which goods may be exchanged 
freely in a common market of ideas and innovation. Today, every country 
in our hemisphere--with one exception--has made the promise of democracy 
a reality. These countries have recognized that representative democracy 
is essential for guaranteeing the basic human rights of their citizens. 
Through common effort, we can make this gift of freedom a reality for 
all.
The United States applauds the people of Paraguay for their great 
accomplishment in resolving last year's constitutional crisis, and we 
welcome the central role of the Organization of American States in 
defending democracy in Paraguay. We commend the people and government of 
Guatemala for their success in forging a comprehensive peace accord, and 
we encourage

[[Page 50]]

the spirit of reconciliation that has firmly taken root 
throughout Central America. Americans continue to maintain a special 
consideration for the people of Haiti as they strive to consolidate 
their new democracy and set the stage for economic growth. Today, all of 
us must work together to encourage the one country--Cuba--that has not 
embraced our common purpose to join the community of democracies.
As the united standard bearers of democracy in the Western Hemisphere, 
we now approach a new century of unprecedented possibilities. Our vision 
is bold, and our expectations are high. Our cooperative spirit was 
nurtured through the Summit of the Americas, where we committed 
ourselves to free trade, representative democracy, relief from poverty, 
and respect for the environment. We are now collaborating closely with 
others in the hemisphere to prepare the agenda for the next Summit of 
the Americas, to be held in Santiago in March 1998. Never before has 
there been such a window of opportunity to promote a higher standard of 
living through improved access to quality education and adequate health 
care. Working together, we can prove that democracy provides the means 
for improving the daily lives of all the citizens of the Americas.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, April 14, 1997, as 
Pan American Day and April 13 through April 19, 1997, as Pan American 
Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the 
flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6988 of April 11, 1997

To Modify Application of Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized 
System of Preferences

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

1. Sections 502(d)(1) and 503(c)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
by Public Law 104-188; 110 Stat. 1755, 1920, 1922 (``the 1974 Act'') (19 
U.S.C. 2462(d)(1) and 2463(c)(1)), provide that the President may 
withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment 
accorded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) with respect 
to any country and any article upon consideration of the factors set 
forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 
2462(c)). Pursuant to sections 502(d)(1) and 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act 
and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) 
of such Act, including, in particular, section 502(c)(5) (19 U.S.C. 
2464(c)(5)) on the extent to which a des-

[[Page 51]]

ignated beneficiary developing country is providing adequate and effective protection of intellectual 
property rights, I have determined that it is appropriate to suspend the 
duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP to certain eligible articles 
that are the product of Argentina, as provided in the Annex to this 
proclamation.
2. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and 
of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, 
including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any 
rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 
502(d)(1), 503(c)(1), and 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to provide that Argentina should no longer be treated 
as a beneficiary developing country with respect to certain eligible 
articles for purposes of the GSP, the HTS is modified as provided in the 
Annex to this proclamation.
    (2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions and provisions of this 
proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (3) The modifications made by this proclamation shall be effective 
with respect to articles both: (i) imported on or after January 1, 1976, 
and (ii) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after 30 days after the date of publication of this proclamation in the 
Federal Register.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6989 of April 15, 1997

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, Americans in communities 
across the country join together to honor victims and survivors, to 
remember their pain, and to recognize their many contributions to 
improving our criminal justice system and helping others affected by 
crime. It is also an occasion for us to acknowledge our significant 
progress in securing crucial rights and services for crime victims.
As we reflect on the events of this past year, we think of all our 
fellow citizens who became victims of crime on our streets, at home, in 
our neighborhoods, in our schools, in our workplaces, and even in our 
sacred places of worship. We remember the images of dozens of mostly 
African American churches being consumed in flames, and we recall church 
leaders and their congregations, representing all denominations and 
races, reaching out to invite healing and rebuilding--not in isolation, 
but in an extraordinary spirit of community and unity. We also remember 
the many contributions of crime victims in pioneering crime prevention 
programs in our schools and working to strengthen our laws and to 
enlighten all of us about the needs of all crime victims.
Through the dedicated efforts of crime victims and their advocates, 
criminal justice workers, and responsive legislators, we have made 
important strides in the struggle against violence. The Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 allocated an increase in 
resources for criminal justice programs, deploying thousands of new 
police officers on our streets. The Brady Bill has prevented over 
225,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying handguns since it 
was enacted. And the Community Notification Act, known as ``Megan's 
Law,'' is helping us protect our most vulnerable citizens by informing 
communities of the presence of convicted pedophiles. With community 
notification, we are working to prevent cases like that of the Act's 
namesake, Megan Kanka, a 7 year-old who died at the hands of a repeat 
sex offender released into an unsuspecting community. With these and 
other preventive measures, we've managed to reduce the rate of violent 
crime for 5 straight years and to restore hope of reaching our goal of a 
peaceful America.
We can also take heart in our efforts to assist victims in need of 
justice and healing in the aftermath of violent crimes. The Violence 
Against Women Act, a historic and comprehensive plan targeted at ending 
crimes against women, has provided much-needed services to countless 
domestic violence victims and their children. Likewise, the National 
Domestic Violence Hotline, established last year, has responded to more 
than 73,000 calls for assistance from around the country. As a result of 
over $500 million in deposits to the Federal Crime Victims Fund in 
fiscal 1996, the States will receive more than three times as much in 
Federal funds as they have received in any previous year to support 
local victim assistance programs. And the Antiterrorism Act has 
guaranteed restitution to victims of Federal crimes and mass violence; 
it has already provided substantial assistance to victims of the 
Oklahoma City bombing.

[[Page 55]]


This year, we can take one more historic step to ensure that victims 
throughout our country are guaranteed the fundamental rights to be 
present at proceedings, to be informed of significant developments in 
their cases and of their rights, and to be heard at sentencing and other 
appropriate times throughout the criminal justice process. The Congress 
should pass a Victims' Rights Amendment to the United States 
Constitution that will, when ratified by the States, ensure that crime 
victims are at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the 
outside looking in.
We must stand united in caring for and assisting crime victims 
throughout our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 13 through April 19, 
1997, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I urge all Americans to 
follow in the example of victim advocates and reaffirm our common 
purpose to protect and comfort one another in times of hardship--not 
only during this special week but also throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6990 of April 17, 1997

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

A commitment to learning has been at the heart of America's progress for 
more than 200 years. Now, as we stand on the threshold of the 21st 
century, our continued success as a Nation depends on the quality of 
education that we provide to all our citizens.
American children must have all the tools they need to make the most of 
their God-given potential. We must help them harness the powerful forces 
of technology, so that every student, including those in the most 
isolated rural towns and those in the poorest inner-city schools, has 
access to the vast universe of knowledge available on the Internet.
However, education involves more than books, facts, and homework 
assignments. Education also concerns the building of character. 
Character is an anchor of our society, and we should work hard to 
cultivate it among our young people. If our Nation is to continue to 
thrive and prosper, we must continue to live up to our ideals.
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, grasped these 
fundamental truths. Espousing the values of education, morality, and 
civic duty throughout his distinguished life, he understood that 
learning and the sharing of experiences are crucial to developing the 
skills that will

[[Page 56]]

mold the character of each new generation. By striving 
to provide the best education possible, we can better prepare our Nation 
for the challenges that confront us as we move forward into the next 
century. The Rebbe rightly saw education as a continuous process of 
effort and experience, in which each person is nurtured from the cradle 
throughout life, bringing out the best in all of us.
I urge all Americans, on this day and throughout the year, to remember 
the teachings of the Rebbe, and to work in partnership with educators, 
administrators, community leaders, and parents to help our young people 
thrive and prosper.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18, 1997, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this day with appropriate activities and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6991 of April 18, 1997

National Day of Prayer, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

America was born out of intense conflict as our forefathers fought the 
forces of oppression and tyranny. From our earliest history, Americans 
have always looked to God for strength and encouragement in those 
moments when darkness seemed to encroach from every side. Our people 
have always believed in the power of prayer and have called upon the 
name of the Lord through times of peace and war, hope and despair, 
prosperity and decline.
In his first inaugural address, during the rush of optimism that 
followed the Colonies' uplifting victory in the American Revolution, 
George Washington observed that ``it would be peculiarly improper to 
omit, in this first official act my fervent supplications to that 
Almighty Being who rules over the universe.'' Amid the bleak turmoil of 
the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln conveyed similar sentiments by calling 
Americans to ``a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this 
favored land.'' Almost a century later, Harry Truman emphasized the need 
for God's help in making decisions: ``when we are striving to strengthen 
the foundation of peace and security we stand in special need of divine 
support.''
Indeed, the familiar phrase ``In God we trust,'' which has been our 
national motto for more than 40 years and which first appeared on our 
coinage during the Civil War, is a fitting testimony to the prayers 
offered up by American women and men through the centuries. Today within 
our Nation's

[[Page 57]]

Capitol Building, a stained glass window depicts General 
Washington humbly kneeling and repeating the words of the 16th Psalm, 
``Preserve me, O God, for in Thee do I put my trust.''
As we face the last years of the 20th century, let us uphold the 
tradition of observing a day in which every American, in his or her own 
way, may come before God seeking increased peace, guidance, and wisdom 
for the challenges ahead. Even as we continue to work toward hopeful 
solutions, may our national resolve be matched by a firm reliance on the 
Author of our lives--for truly it is in God that we trust.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, has called our citizens to reaffirm 
annually our dependence on Almighty God by recognizing a ``National Day 
of Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1997, as a National Day of Prayer. As 
in previous years, let us once again celebrate this day in the tradition 
of our Founders by humbly asking for divine help in maintaining the 
courage, determination, faith, and vigilance so necessary to our 
continued advancement as a people. On this National Day of Prayer, may 
all Americans come together to reaffirm our reliance upon our Creator, 
and, in the words of Franklin Roosevelt, to ``pray to Him now for the 
vision to see our way clearly.''
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6992 of April 19, 1997

National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Giving life to another through an organ or tissue transplant is one of 
the most selfless human acts. The person choosing to become a donor 
usually receives no tangible thanks and gains no fame or glory from the 
gesture. And yet the decision to sign a donor card does give the donor a 
quiet, inner fulfillment in the knowledge that he or she may one day 
help save a life, bringing new joy to another person and their family. 
Often, for many Americans, this sense of fulfillment is sufficient 
thanks.
Today, more than 50,000 Americans are on the national transplant waiting 
list and about 2,000 more people need transplants every month. 
Unfortunately, even though this country has an adequate supply of 
individuals who qualify as organ donors, many people have still not 
chosen to become one. Patients in truly desperate circumstances are 
depending on their fellow Americans to choose to become organ and tissue 
donors.
Stunning advances in transplant research and technology have made 
miracles possible, but we must do our part to make the dreams of people 

[[Page 58]]

awaiting transplants become reality. Many Americans are unaware of the 
national shortage of organ donors, and all of us must work together to 
spread the word.
Let us take advantage of our enormous power to save a life or to enrich 
the quality of life for those who otherwise face endless pain, torment, 
or death. I urge every American to respond to the urgent call for organ 
and tissue donors by signing a donor card immediately. Let us also reach 
out to educate our fellow Americans about the importance of organ and 
tissue donations. We must work with our religious communities and 
community organizations to spread this important message. The Federal 
Government has already established partnerships with the Union of Hebrew 
Congregations and the Congress of National Black Churches in an effort 
to educate congregations and clergy across our Nation through sermons, 
Sunday school programs, and community events. We should do more.
We should recognize that our greatest ambassadors for organ and tissue 
donation are donors, donor families and recipients. Their personal 
stories have motivated and inspired others, and we should take better 
advantage of these great resources. Taken together, these and other 
efforts will save the lives of countless loved ones. And we should take 
the opportunity to recognize and celebrate Americans who donate these 
gifts of life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 20 through April 26, 
1997, as National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week. I call upon 
health care professionals, educators, the media, public and private 
organizations concerned with organ donation and transplantation, and all 
the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate 
activities and programs that promote organ donation and invite new 
donors to become involved.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6993 of April 19, 1997

National Wildlife Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Our Nation is blessed with a wealth of wildlife, wild places, and 
natural resources that enrich the lives of all Americans. Conserving our 
wildlife--whether antelope or grizzly bear, salmon or serpent, or plumed 
bird--is of urgent importance. Our vast system of wildlife refuges has 
played a vital role in this endeavor. Helping to ensure greater harmony 
between people and nature, more than 92 million acres of land and waters 
are dedicated to wildlife conservation, encompassing 500 refuges, with 
at least one in

[[Page 59]]

every State and within a short drive of most major 
cities. These wonderful resources provide opportunities for people of 
all ages and from all walks of life, and from cities, suburbs, and the 
rural heartland, to learn about and participate in the effort to 
preserve the places and wildlife that contribute so much to our Nation's 
heritage and natural wealth.
The appreciation and protection of wildlife, particularly of endangered 
or threatened species, is both the right and responsibility of all 
Americans. Indeed, countless individuals and private volunteer 
organizations across the United States have already made a significant 
contribution to wildlife protection. Only by engaging communities in 
conservation, by taking note of and rewarding community service efforts, 
and by maintaining diverse approaches to wildlife protection, can we 
preserve our wildlife today and for future generations.
We set aside this week to celebrate the role that citizens and private 
volunteer organizations play in engaging in service activities, and in 
advancing the knowledge, appreciation, and protection of wildlife and 
the environment. Let us also work to spread this message to broader 
audiences and encourage all individuals and groups to contribute to this 
national goal. I urge all Americans, private organizations, businesses, 
community leaders, elected officials and governmental agencies to do all 
they can to preserve and value the role of wildlife resources in our 
lives. This tradition of nature education will continue to teach our 
children how to be lifelong stewards of the environment and help to 
build the knowledge and understanding essential to the protection of 
nature's abundant gifts.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 20 through April 26, 
1997, as National Wildlife Week. I ask all Americans to find ways to 
promote the conservation and protection of our wildlife and wild places.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6994 of April 19, 1997

National Park Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

One hundred and twenty-five years ago, America made a momentous 
decision: to set aside and protect in perpetuity an extraordinary part 
of our young Nation. With the signing of the Yellowstone National Park 
Act on March 1, 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant created the world's 
first national park, and the succeeding years have proved beyond all 
doubt the wisdom and foresight of that decision. Known throughout the 
world for its beauty and the natural wonders that lie within its 
boundaries, Yellowstone has in-

[[Page 60]]

spired the creation of a multitude of 
other national parks, both here and in other countries, preserving for 
future generations the rich natural and cultural legacy of our world.
Today, our 374 national parks protect America's unparalleled wonders and 
the history of those who have helped shape our land. Our national parks 
preserve both where we live and who we are. In America's national parks, 
we see Americans through their experiences--war and peace, tragedy and 
triumph, struggle and liberty. Our national park sites invite us not 
only to marvel at the grand geography of Yellowstone or the Great 
Smokies, but also to explore the innovative genius of Thomas Edison at 
the Edison National Historic Site in New Jersey, to visit the remains of 
an ancient civilization at Mesa Verde in Colorado, or to walk the 
hallways of the Kansas school where the struggle for civil rights 
ultimately led to the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme 
Court decision.
In addition to the parks themselves, the national park spirit thrives in 
thousands of communities across the country where the National Park 
Service provides support and technical advice to create close-to-home 
recreational opportunities and to honor local history through programs 
such as Rivers, Trails, and Conservation Assistance, the National 
Register of Historic Places, and National Historic Landmarks. The 
National Park Service, in partnership with organizations and individuals 
dedicated to conservation and historic preservation, is ensuring that 
our national parks touch the lives of as many people as possible, while 
sparking an interest among our Nation's children in archaeology, 
ethnography, history, historic landscapes, and historic structures.
Indeed, the national parks remain a magnet for the American public. 
Every year millions of visitors flock to them--270 million in 1996. 
Surveying our history and heritage, our national parks let us reach out 
and touch the past.
As we observe this week, let us remember with gratitude all those who 
are and have been entrusted with the stewardship of these treasured 
places. As the parks and the mandate of the National Park Service have 
evolved, the demands on those who manage these resources have become 
more complex and the skills required of the National Park Service work 
force have become more sophisticated. These men and women are the 
guardians of our cultural and natural treasures, and, on behalf of all 
Americans, I express my deepest thanks.
This year, National Park Week celebrates the strength of our unique and 
diverse system of national parks, and I urge all Americans to share in 
the wonderful experiences these places offer all of us.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 21 through April 27, 
1997, as National Park Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6995 of April 22, 1997

Law Day, U.S.A., 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

This is the 40th year that Americans have celebrated the first day of 
May as Law Day, a special time to reflect on our legal heritage. It is 
an opportunity for all Americans to pause and consider how the rule of 
law has contributed to the freedoms we enjoy, and to our greatness as a 
Nation.
The theme of this year's Law Day commemoration, ``Celebrate Your 
Freedom,'' focuses on the one concept that most defines us as a Nation. 
It was freedom that we fought for when we created this country. It is 
freedom that still sets us apart from many of the world's nations. And 
it is freedom's lamp that still beckons the oppressed to America from 
all parts of the globe.
The quest to ensure our freedom is the essence of what it means to be an 
American, and the bulwark of our freedom is the law and the legal 
system. James Madison once observed that if men were angels, governments 
would not be necessary. Laws are the instruments by which the people, 
through their government, protect themselves from, and regulate their 
relations with, each other. At the same time, laws also serve to 
restrain the power of that government. Finding the proper balance 
between the conflicting interests and rights of individuals, 
corporations, and government has never been easy. But we rely on the 
rule of law itself to protect all that is most precious to us. Without 
it, other nations have descended into a state where force alone prevails 
and justice is a mere hope.
Thanks to the genius of our Founders and the Constitutional system they 
created, Americans have witnessed the steady march of progress toward an 
open, inclusive society. We vote in free, fair elections. We worship 
according to our own faith. We associate freely with whomever we choose. 
And we are able to express our disagreements with our government freely 
and openly. These rights, routinely accepted today, have been maintained 
only through years of testing and reinforcement in our Federal and State 
courts, which have continued to extend freedom and liberty across the 
land.
So when we celebrate our freedom, we also celebrate a system of law that 
makes freedom possible. For more than two centuries, we have prospered 
and endured because we have relied on that system of law. We must keep 
that system strong and vibrant in our national life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20 of April 7, 1961, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 1997, as Law Day. I urge the people of the United States 
to use this occasion to consider anew how our laws protect our freedoms 
and contribute to our national well-being. I call upon members of the 
legal profession, civic associations, educators, librarians, public 
officials, and the media to promote the observance of this day with 
appropriate programs and activities. I also call upon public officials 
to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings 
throughout the day.

[[Page 62]]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 6996 of May 1, 1997

Older Americans Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Each year we set aside the month of May as a special time to pay tribute 
to older Americans and to acknowledge their many contributions to our 
national life. For the better part of this century, through tough times 
and good times, these Americans have raised families, strengthened our 
economy, defended our Nation, and reaffirmed our deepest values. All of 
us who are heirs to their service and sacrifice owe them a profound debt 
of gratitude.
The theme of this year's observance, ``Caregiving: Compassion in 
Action,'' reminds us of one of the most important ways in which we can 
repay that debt. Each day across America, some 22 million caregivers and 
volunteers dedicate themselves to improving the quality of life for 
older family members, friends, and neighbors. By providing personal 
care, housekeeping, transportation, and innumerable other services and 
assistance, these caregivers enable many older Americans to remain in 
their own homes and communities, maintaining a precious measure of 
dignity and independence.
As America's population of older Americans continues to grow in number, 
we will have an even greater need to call on the skills and compassion 
of caregivers. In keeping with the spirit of service that is sweeping 
across our Nation today, I ask that all Americans--every day, but 
especially during Older Americans Month--reach out to an older person in 
need, sharing time, talents, and attention with someone who has already 
shared so much with us. By putting our compassion in action to serve our 
older citizens, we can build a more promising future for all our people.
Older Americans deserve our respect and support for they have worked 
diligently in so many ways to enrich and preserve the way of life we all 
enjoy. Our senior citizens have woven the fabric of our Nation to 
exemplify the values and beliefs that have made our country great.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1997 as Older 
Americans Month. I call upon Government officials, businesses, 
communities, volunteers, educators, and all the people of the United 
States to honor our older Americans and acknowledge the important 
contributions made by their caregivers, this month and throughout the 
year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of

Proclamation 6997 of May 1, 1997

 Loyalty Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Each year, Americans dedicate the first day of May to formally 
acknowledge our love for this great land and our loyalty to the 
principles of freedom and equality on which our Nation was founded. This 
love and loyalty cannot be mandated or legislated; rather, these traits 
spring freely from our hearts and minds.
Looking back across the centuries, we recognize that each generation of 
Americans has been called upon to express its love and loyalty in a 
unique way. Our founders, defying the forces of tyranny, solemnly 
pledged their lives and futures to defend the new Nation they had 
created, a Nation born of reverence for human rights and the principle 
of self-determination. Less than a century later, another generation of 
Americans spilled its blood to preserve the unity of our Nation and to 
ensure that America lived up to its ideals of freedom, justice, and 
equality.
The challenges of our own century have called for an extraordinary 
measure of devotion from millions of our citizens. Through two 
devastating world wars and the decades of the Cold War, Americans laid 
down their lives for love of country and to defend democracy, advance 
human rights, and oppose the specter of oppression.
Today we are blessed to be living in a time of unprecedented peace and 
possibility, when the ideals of democracy and human dignity so 
eloquently articulated by our founders have been widely embraced by 
nations in our own hemisphere and around the world. But we have fresh 
opportunities to prove our love and loyalty to America. The challenge 
for our generation is to realize the promise of our Nation: to be a 
strong and steady influence for peace and freedom across the globe; to 
be a powerful voice for human rights wherever they are silenced; to live 
up to America's promise of justice, equality, and opportunity by 
ensuring that all of our people have the tools and encouragement they 
need to meet their God-given potential.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529, has designated May 1 of each year as 
``Loyalty Day.'' Let us, on this day, remember the contributions of the 
many courageous Americans who have gone before us, and let us keep faith 
with them by reaffirming our love for and loyalty to this Nation they 
sustained with their service and sacrifice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1997, as Loyalty Day. I urge all 
Americans to recall, on this day, the valor and selflessness of all 
those who made this Nation so worthy of our love and loyalty. I call 
upon Gov-

[[Page 64]]

ernment officials to display the flag of the United States and 
to participate in patriotic activities in support of this national 
observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 6998 of May 5, 1997

Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Today, almost 10 million Americans can trace their roots to Asia and the 
Pacific Islands. This month provides a wonderful opportunity to 
recognize and celebrate all the ways in which Asian and Pacific 
Americans have enhanced our Nation and strengthened our communities.
North America was visited regularly by Asian and Pacific traders as 
early as the 16th century, and by the late 1800s, this continent was 
receiving large numbers of immigrants from China, Japan, Korea, the 
Philippines, and the Indian subcontinent. These settlers worked hard, 
turning wilderness into bountiful farmland in Hawaii, opening new 
industries in the West, and helping to build the first transcontinental 
railroad.
Along with a vast array of skills, Americans of Asian and Pacific Island 
ancestry brought their remarkable traditions of hard work and respect 
for family and education to their new country. Their belief in the 
American Dream of equality and opportunity enabled them to face the 
challenges of adversity and discrimination and achieve a record of 
distinguished service in all fields, from academia to government, from 
business to the military, and medicine to the arts. These people and 
their children managed to preserve the rich legacy of their homelands 
while also embracing the best values and traditions that define our 
Nation.
In recent years, newly arrived groups of Asian and Pacific peoples have 
continued to enrich our proud tradition of cultural diversity and endow 
our Nation with energy and vision. Today, as we prepare to enter the 
21st century, we must continually strive to fulfill the ideals that 
originally attracted so many immigrants to our shores.
To honor the accomplishments of Asian and Pacific Americans and to 
recognize their many contributions to our Nation, the Congress, by 
Public Law 102-450, has designated the month of May as ``Asian/Pacific 
American Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1997 as Asian/Pacific American Heritage 
Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
occasion with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 6999 of May 7, 1997

Mother's Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

As we prepare to enter the 21st century, in the midst of a rapidly 
changing world, one thing remains constant--the unconditional love 
between a mother and her child. This love provides us with a cornerstone 
and sanctuary throughout our entire lives. Mothers nurture, challenge, 
and instill strong values in their children, find solutions, arbitrate 
disputes, organize activities, care and teach, influence and lead, give, 
share, and encourage. Their abiding moral principles shape our families, 
our communities, and our national life.
Today, mothers face many different challenges--from balancing the 
responsibilities of home and work, to raising families on their own--
while contending with the often daunting challenges of modern society. 
They do this all while meeting the day-to-day responsibilities of class 
projects, car payments, and the flu season. And yet, they succeed, 
determined to protect what is so precious to them and to make brighter 
futures for themselves, their children, and their Nation.
Each year we welcome the opportunity to set aside a day to acknowledge 
all that our mothers--whether biological, adoptive, or foster--have 
given us. It is a time to reflect on all we have gained from their 
guidance, care, and sacrifice and a time to openly express our gratitude 
and love. The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 
Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as 
``Mother's Day'' and requested the President to call for its appropriate 
observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 11, 1997, as Mother's Day. Whether we 
are able to share this special day with our mothers or are blessed with 
memories of them, in our hearts they are with us always. I urge all 
Americans to express their love and respect for their mothers and to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 7000 of May 7, 1997

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Law enforcement officers are true heroes, quietly risking their lives 
every day to protect our public safety and private property. The 
routine, everyday nature of their courage makes it all the more 
extraordinary. Day and night, these brave men and women leave home, put 
on their badges, and report for duty, putting their lives on the line 
for the rest of us.
Today, an estimated 587,000 men and women are sworn police officers, 
working to enforce our Nation's laws and maintain order in our society. 
As citizens we owe these officers respect and gratitude, and Police Week 
is a welcome time for us to join together and salute these officers for 
the selfless work they carry out so faithfully all year long.
Sadly, during Police Week we also pause, on Peace Officers Memorial Day, 
to remember our fallen officers. Last year, 117 Federal, State, and 
local officers were killed in the line of duty. Although this number 
dropped to the lowest level in over 30 years--and the number of police 
officers killed by firearms alone dropped to 55 from 71 the previous 
year--these statistics, compiled by the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial Fund, remain a cause for great concern. The loss of 
any police officer is a tragedy, and as a Nation, we mourn and remember 
these men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their 
lives. While we can never repay the debt we owe to these fallen officers 
and their families, we can--and must--honor their memory by carrying on 
their crusade to make America a better and safer place.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962 (76 Stat. 676), the 
Congress has authorized and requested the President to designate May 15 
of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the week in which it 
falls as ``Police Week,'' and, by Public Law 103-322 (36 U.S.C. 175), 
has directed that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers 
Memorial Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 1997, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 11 through May 17, 1997, as Police Week. I call upon the people 
of the United States to observe these occasions with appropriate 
ceremonies, programs, and activities. I also request the Governors of 
the United States and of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as well as the 
appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the 
flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day on all 
buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and 
all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also invite all 
Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes on that 
day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 7001 of May 8, 1997

Jewish Heritage Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

The American Jewish community, with its rich and diverse culture, has 
served as a continuous source of ethical and moral values for our great 
Nation since its founding. The principles of Jewish heritage--family, 
community, faith, and service--parallel the ideals that inspired our 
country's founders and that anchor our modern democracy.
Members of the Jewish faith have long added to America's cultural life a 
legacy of law and human compassion, a struggle for freedom and fairness, 
and a love of learning and the arts. Drawing from their proud heritage, 
Jewish citizens have made vital contributions to every sector of 
society, as scientists and soldiers, judges and teachers, artists, 
entrepreneurs, and philanthropists.
Jewish traditions lend special meaning to the spring season. The recent 
celebration of Passover commemorates the exodus of Jewish slaves from 
ancient Egypt. The observance of this religious and historical milestone 
also honors the character of the Jewish people, who, despite continual 
hardship, clung to their enduring faith in God and the promise of a 
brighter future. The annual spring commemorations of Passover, Holocaust 
Memorial Day, and Israel's Independence are occasions for deep 
reflection by American Jewry and demonstrate to all Americans the 
importance of remembrance, faith, freedom, and justice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 11 through May 18, 
1997, as Jewish Heritage Week. I urge all Americans to observe this week 
with appropriate programs and to pay tribute to American Jews for 
sharing their message of hope and perseverance with all of us.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.

Proclamation 7002 of May 9, 1997

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

The United States has the finest, safest transportation system in the 
world--superior highways and waterways, railroads, pipelines, and 
air-

[[Page 68]]

ports. This system unites a diverse Nation, provides economic 
opportunity, and enhances our quality of life by giving our citizens 
almost unrestricted mobility.
As we approach the 21st century, we must maintain the strength and 
reliability of this transportation system. The globalization of our 
economy demands more efficient shipping if we are to remain competitive. 
The growth in passenger traffic spurred by an expanding economy requires 
new and better ways of enabling people to travel safely and 
conveniently. In an unpredictable world, our transportation system must 
be able to quickly move military and other equipment, humanitarian 
supplies, and people to meet the demands of emergencies and natural 
disasters throughout the world.
All levels of government and industry are working together to ensure 
that our transportation system will continue to meet these challenges in 
the years to come. We must also continue to address the need for a 
cleaner environment and for sustainable communities, and we must ensure 
that transportation is available for people with special needs. This 
effort will require new technologies, advanced materials, improved 
operating practices and logistical systems, and other innovations.
We must also strive to educate our youth in technology and 
transportation issues. The Department of Transportation has launched the 
Garrett A. Morgan Technology and Transportation Futures Program to 
pursue this important goal through math, science, and technology 
literacy programs, private-public education partnerships, and other 
initiatives. An African American, Garrett Morgan invented the traffic 
signal and is recognized as the father of our safe transportation 
technology program. He served as a model of public service and as a 
catalyst to enhance transportation education at all levels.
This week, Americans honor the men and women who, like Garrett Morgan, 
have done and are doing so much to design, build, operate, and ensure 
the safety of our transportation system. We salute them for their 
contributions to our Nation and for helping to ensure that our 
transportation system remains the best in the world.
In recognition of the millions of Americans who work every day to meet 
our transportation needs, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 
16, 1957 (36 U.S.C. 160), has designated the third Friday in May of each 
year as ``National Defense Transportation Day'' and, by joint resolution 
approved May 14, 1962 (36 U.S.C. 166), declared that the week in which 
that Friday falls be designated ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 16, 1997, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 11 through May 17, 1997, as National 
Transportation Week. I urge all Americans to observe these occasions 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities, giving due recognition to 
the individuals and organizations that build, operate, safeguard, and 
maintain this country's modern transportation system.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of

Proclamation 7003 of May 14, 1997

National Safe Boating Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

America's scenic waterways--the beautiful lakes, magnificent rivers, and 
immense oceans at our borders--are a national treasure. Some 76 million 
Americans of all ages and abilities--more than one-fourth of our 
Nation's population--take to these vast resources every year to enjoy 
the beauty of the outdoors, each in his or her own way. But boaters too 
often forget that, besides being relaxing and fun, boating can be 
dangerous.
The U.S. Coast Guard's most recent annual statistics reveal 851 
fatalities related to recreational boating, a 13 percent increase from 
the previous year. Tragically, 90 percent of those victims were not 
wearing a life jacket. Because falling overboard and capsizing are the 
two leading causes of all recreational boating fatalities, this safety 
device is essential to boating safety. Refraining from drinking alcohol 
is also essential to assure safe boating, as more than half of all 
boating accidents involve alcohol.
Safe-boating education, which is available through a wide variety of 
sources--the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, U.S. Power Squadrons, State and 
local governments, and numerous private organizations--is another key to 
accident prevention. Ninety percent of all boating fatalities occur on 
boats whose operators had no formal boating safety instruction. By word 
and by example, we must inform and educate both current and future 
generations of boaters to become knowledgeable boat operators. Learn 
about safety equipment and the ``rules of the road.'' Then follow a few 
simple rules: wear a life jacket; never drink while boating; operate at 
safe speeds; and be alert for weather changes.
By making safety the first priority and emphasizing the necessity for 
all boaters, especially children, to wear life jackets, we can help to 
put tragic boating accidents behind us and enjoy more fully the beauty 
and excitement of the open water.
I commend the U.S. Coast Guard, Federal departments and agencies, States 
and local governments, and the many recreational boating organizations 
who are actively promoting saving lives on the water through the theme 
of this year's campaign: ``Life Jackets. They Float. You Don't.''
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices the year-
round, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 
U.S.C. 161), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to 
proclaim annually the seven-day period prior to the Memorial Day Weekend 
as ``National Safe Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 17 through May 23, 1997, as

[[Page 70]]

National Safe Boating Week. I encourage the Governors of the 50 States, the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States to join in observing this occasion and 
to urge all Americans to practice safe boating habits not only during 
this week but also throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 7004 of May 19, 1997

World Trade Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Two statistics sum up both the challenge and the promise of today's 
dynamic global economy: 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside 
the United States, and U.S. exports generated more than $830 billion in 
sales in 1996. The theme of this year's World Trade Week, ``Make 
Locally, Sell Globally,'' exhorts American businesses to take advantage 
of the enormous commercial potential of the international marketplace, 
and we are poised to do so.
Over the past 4 years, trade has spurred more than a quarter of our 
overall domestic economic growth. During this period, the United States 
under the leadership of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 
signed more than 200 new trade agreements and is once again the world's 
leading exporter. In recent months, we have concluded historic 
agreements in the World Trade Organization that opened up the world 
telecommunications services market to U.S. firms. We also have 
negotiated a pact that will eliminate tariffs on information technology 
products by the year 2000. Together, these agreements offer American 
business better access to markets representing more than $1 trillion in 
goods and services and are models for further market-opening 
initiatives.
The North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has not only increased 
trade with our member partners to a level of $425 billion annually, but 
also has provided greater stability to the global economy. We are 
committed to building on this success by achieving a Free Trade Area of 
the Americas, and we look toward a comprehensive trade agreement with 
Chile as the next concrete step in this direction.
Selling globally also requires vigorous trade enforcement efforts, such 
as those we initiated recently by improving the protection of 
intellectual property rights in China and some 20 other countries around 
the world. Our ongoing efforts to eliminate trade barriers in Asia have 
already paid dividends--for example, U.S. exports to Japan have grown by 
more than 40 percent since 1993. We will also continue to strictly 
enforce existing trade laws to ensure that imported goods in U.S. 
markets do not enjoy an unfair advantage over those produced by U.S. 
companies and workers.

[[Page 71]]

We are committed to helping all U.S. businesses continue to succeed--not 
only by opening markets, but also by assisting U.S. exporters. My 
Administration, through the efforts of the Trade Promotion Coordinating 
Committee, has developed a National Export Strategy to help small- and 
medium-size companies sell globally to realize their export potential. 
Our nationwide network of U.S. Export Assistance Centers combines under 
one roof the services of the Department of Commerce, the Small Business 
Administration, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and other agencies to 
improve business access to trade information and financing. Over the 
past 4 years, this network has more than doubled the amount of export 
sales it facilitates. Our finance agencies, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, 
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade and 
Development Agency, also help American businesses compete on a level 
playing field in this increasingly competitive world economy.
We can be proud of this record of achievement, but we must build on it. 
Fair trade and open markets create stable economies in which democracy 
can take root and flourish. The United States alone has the legacy, the 
resources, and the responsibility to lead the world in this endeavor, 
and we must continue to do so.
As we observe World Trade Week, 1997, I am confident that, working 
together, we can sustain America's leadership in the global economy, 
generate millions of new jobs, and improve the quality of life for all 
our people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 18 through May 24, 
1997, as World Trade Week. I invite the people of the United States to 
observe this week with ceremonies, activities, and programs that 
celebrate the potential of international trade.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.

Proclamation 7005 of May 21, 1997

National Maritime Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Throughout America's history--from the Revolutionary War to today's 
global challenges--our United States Merchant Marine has fulfilled its 
mission with patriotism and efficiency, transporting our Nation's 
cargoes in times of both peace and conflict. Our Merchant Marine has 
shown its mettle time and again during major United States military 
engagements, proving to be a crucial component in support of our Armed 
Forces' efforts to protect our national interests and defend our 
freedom. Today, we salute

[[Page 72]]

these skilled civilian seafarers, who continue 
to distinguish their profession and demonstrate their commitment to 
America's security through their unwavering support of our troops abroad 
in both peacekeeping and humanitarian operations.
History has taught us how important a nation's flag presence is on the 
high seas. Heeding the lessons of the past, the Congress and I 
reaffirmed our pledge for a strong U.S.-flag fleet when I signed into 
law the Maritime Security Act of 1996. This legislation sets the course 
for America's Merchant Marine into the 21st century, sustaining a strong 
sealift capability and bolstering national security. The Act will 
strengthen American maritime and allied industries, while energizing our 
efforts to further stimulate the economy through trade and commerce.
As we look to the challenges of the future, we recognize the continuing 
importance of our U.S. domestic maritime fleet to the maintenance of our 
Nation's commercial and defense maritime interests. I commend the 
merchant mariners whose unstinting service has helped maintain both our 
domestic and our international U.S. fleets.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the 
Congress, by a resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 
of each year as ``National Maritime Day'' and has authorized and 
requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its 
observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 1997, as National Maritime Day. I 
urge all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities and by displaying the flag of the United 
States at their homes and in their communities. I also request that all 
ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7006 of May 22, 1997

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

The observance of Memorial Day is one of America's noblest traditions. 
At its core lies the most basic of the beliefs on which our Nation was 
founded: that freedom is so precious it is worth the price of our lives 
to preserve it.
Throughout our history, we have been blessed by the courage and 
commitment of Americans who were willing to pay that price, and more 
than 1.3 million of them have died for our Nation. From Lexington and 
Concord to Iwo Jima and the Persian Gulf, on fields of battle across 
America and

[[Page 73]]

around the world, our men and women in uniform have risked--
and lost--their lives to protect America's interests, to advance the 
ideals of democracy, and to defend the liberty we hold so dear.
This spirit of selfless sacrifice is an unbroken thread woven through 
our history. Wherever they came from, whenever they served, our fallen 
heroes knew they were fighting to preserve our freedom. On Memorial Day 
we remember them, and we acknowledge that we stand as a great, proud, 
and free Nation because of their devotion.
But this is not the only day on which we honor their service and 
sacrifice. Whenever we lend our hearts and hands and voices to the work 
of peace in the world, whenever we show respect for the flag, cast a 
vote in an election, or exercise our freedoms of speech, assembly, and 
worship, we honor our fellow Americans who guaranteed those freedoms 
with their lives. In respect and recognition of these courageous men and 
women, the Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 11, 1950 (64 
Stat. 158), requested that the President issue a proclamation calling 
upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a 
day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day 
when the American people might unite in prayer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 26, 1997, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to join in prayer. I urge 
the press, radio, television, and all other information media to take 
part in this observance.
I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of 
government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff during this 
Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the 
United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control, and I 
request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-
staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7007 of May 30, 1997

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a)(1)(A), and 503(c)(1) of title V of 
the Trade Act of 1974 (``the 1974 Act''), 19 U.S.C. 2461-2466, as 
amended, the President may designate or withdraw designation of 
specified articles pro-

[[Page 74]]

vided for in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTS) as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under 
the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when imported from 
designated beneficiary developing countries.
2. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act, the President is 
authorized to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries 
for purposes of the GSP.
3. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, some beneficiary 
developing countries are subject to the competitive need limitation on 
the preferential treatment afforded under the GSP to eligible products.
4. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, a country that is 
no longer treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to an 
eligible article may be redesignated as a beneficiary developing country 
with respect to such article if imports of such article from such 
country did not exceed the competitive need limitation in section 
503(c)(2)(A) during the preceding calendar year.
5. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, the President may 
disregard the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) with respect to any eligible article if the 
aggregate appraised value of the imports of such article into the United 
States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed the applicable 
amount set forth in section 503(c)(2)(F)(ii).
6. Further, pursuant to subsection 503(d) of the 1974 Act, the President 
may waive the application of the competitive need limitation in section 
503(c)(2)(A) with respect to any eligible article of any beneficiary 
developing country.
7. Pursuant to section 503(a)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act, the President may 
designate articles as eligible articles only for countries designated as 
least-developed beneficiary developing countries under section 
502(a)(2), if the President determines that such articles are not 
import-sensitive in the context of imports from such least-developed 
beneficiary developing countries.
8. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a)(1)(A), and 503(c)(1) of the 1974 
Act, I have determined, after taking into account information and advice 
received from the United States International Trade Commission under 
section 503(a)(1)(A), to designate additional articles as eligible 
articles for purposes of the GSP. In order to do so, it is necessary to 
subdivide and amend the nomenclature of existing provisions of the HTS.
9. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act, and having due 
regard for the eligibility criteria set forth therein, I have determined 
that it is appropriate to designate Cambodia as a beneficiary developing 
country and a least-developed beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP.
10. Pursuant to sections 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that certain beneficiary countries should no longer receive preferential 
tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to certain eligible articles 
imported in quantities that exceed the applicable competitive need 
limitation.
11. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that certain countries should be redesignated as beneficiary developing 
countries with respect to certain eligible articles that had been 
imported pre

[[Page 75]]


viously in quantities that exceeded the competitive need 
limitation of section 503(c)(2)(A).
12. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) should be waived with respect to certain eligible 
articles.
13. Pursuant to section 503(d) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that 
the competitive need limitation of section 503(c)(2)(A) should be waived 
with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary 
developing countries. I have received the advice of the United States 
International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the United 
States are likely to be adversely affected by such waivers and I have 
determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in 
sections 501 and 502(c), that such waivers are in the national economic 
interest of the United States. In order to grant one of those waivers, 
it is necessary to subdivide and amend the nomenclature of existing 
provisions of the HTS.
14. Pursuant to section 503(a)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
to designate certain articles as eligible articles under the GSP only 
for least-developed beneficiary developing countries.
15. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, 19 U.S.C. 2483, as amended, authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to provide that Cambodia is designated as a beneficiary 
developing country and a least-developed beneficiary developing country 
for purposes of the GSP, that one or more countries that have not been 
treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more 
eligible articles should be redesignated as beneficiary developing 
countries with respect to such article or articles for purposes of the 
GSP, and that one or more countries should no longer be treated as 
beneficiary developing countries with respect to an eligible article for 
purposes of the GSP, general note 4 to the HTS is modified as provided 
in section A of Annex I to this proclamation.
    (2) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles for 
purposes of the GSP when imported from beneficiary developing countries, 
the HTS is modified as provided in section B of Annex I to this 
proclamation.

purposes of the GSP when imported from any beneficiary developing 
country other than India, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the 
HTS subheading enumerated in section C(1)(a) of Annex I to this 
proclamation is modified as provided in such Annex section.
      (b) In order to designate an article as an eligible article for 
purposes of the GSP when imported from any beneficiary developing 
country, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the HTS subheading 
enumerated in

[[Page 76]]

section C(1)(b) of Annex I to this proclamation is 
modified as provided in such Annex section.
      (c) In order to restore preferential tariff treatment under the 
GSP to a country that has been excluded from the benefits of the GSP for 
an eligible article, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for each of 
the HTS subheadings enumerated in section C(1)(c) of Annex I to this 
proclamation is modified as provided in such Annex section.
      (d) In order to provide that one or more countries should no 
longer be treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to an 
eligible article for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special 
subcolumn for each of the HTS provisions enumerated in section C(2) of 
Annex I to this proclamation is modified as provided in such Annex 
section.
    (4) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles for 
purposes of the GSP only when imported from designated least-developed 
beneficiary developing countries, the HTS is modified as provided in 
Annex II to this proclamation.
    (5) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 
Act shall apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to 
the beneficiary developing countries set forth in Annex III to this 
proclamation.
    (6) In order to provide for the continuation of previously 
proclaimed staged reductions in the Rates of Duty 1-General subcolumn, 
for goods that fall in the HTS subheadings modified by section B(1) of 
Annex I to this proclamation and that are entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates specified in Annex IV 
to this proclamation, the rate of duty in the HTS set forth in such 
subcolumn for each of the HTS subheadings enumerated in Annex IV to this 
proclamation is deleted and the rate of duty provided in such Annex is 
inserted in lieu thereof.
    (7) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (8) (a) The modifications made by Annexes I, II, and IV to this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set

effective on May 31, 1997.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7008 of May 30, 1997

Small Business Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

America was built on the enterprise of our people--on their ideas, their 
energy, their willingness to take risks, and their willingness to pursue 
their dreams. Throughout the decades, men and women of independence, 
optimism, and determination have come to our shores, confident in the 
knowledge that in America they could build a life for themselves and 
their families through their own initiative, creating and developing 
businesses in every field of endeavor.
The success of the small business community has been a hallmark of our 
free enterprise system, helping to drive the engine of America's economy 
as we compete in the global marketplace. The invaluable contributions of 
small business owners to the strength of our economy are reflected in 
some extraordinary statistics. The recent record growth of the small 
business community has resulted in 840,000 new employer firms over the 
past year--the highest number ever, and a 2-percent increase over the 
last record set in 1995. Small businesses employ 53 percent of America's 
private work force, account for 47 percent of all sales in the country, 
and generate more than half of our private gross domestic product; and 
industries dominated by small business produced almost 1.5 million new 
jobs in the last year alone.
Our challenge now is to help America's small business community build on 
this phenomenal record of success. My Administration is committed to 
giving small business men and women the opportunity to realize their 
dreams. The Small Business Administration has a portfolio guaranteeing 
over $27 billion in loans to 185,000 small businesses that otherwise 
would not have access to such capital. We are encouraging 
microenterprise through the Department of Treasury's Community 
Development Financial Institution Fund, an initiative that makes it 
easier for prospective entrepreneurs to obtain the training and 
financing they need to start their own businesses. Working in 
partnership with State governments, we are striving to help modernize 
our Nation's small and medium-sized manufacturers and removing 
regulatory barriers to the adoption of new technologies in such fields 
as telemedicine, building and construction, and environmental 
technologies. We have also developed a National Export Strategy to help 
America's small and medium-sized businesses realize their export 
potential and compete effectively in the global marketplace.
As we observe Small Business Week, I join all Americans in saluting the 
men and women who have embraced the opportunities our country offers, 
whose hard work is transforming their communities, and whose energy and 
initiative are building our country into the kind of Nation we want to 
be in the 21st century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 1 through June 7, 
1997, as Small Business Week. I call upon Government officials and all 
the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate 
cere-

[[Page 86]]

monies, activities, and programs that celebrate the achievements of 
small business owners and encourage the development of new enterprises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  

<R05>
Proclamation 7009 of June 6, 1997

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Our Nation's flag has always flown in the vanguard of the American 
journey, reminding us of our proud past and beckoning us into a future 
full of promise. Its bold colors reflect the courage and exuberance of 
the American people, and its simple but inspired design symbolizes both 
the unity and diversity that define our Nation.
Adopted by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, the Stars and 
Stripes became the official flag of the young United States and a 
compelling symbol of our new independence. Woven into its folds were the 
hopes, dreams, and determination of the extraordinary individuals who 
founded this country--hopes for a system of government that would honor 
the rights and dignity of every citizen; dreams that their great 
experiment in democracy would succeed; and determination to ensure that 
success, even at the cost of their own lives. Since that time, 
generations of Americans have invested the flag with their own hopes and 
dreams. Millions of immigrants, traveling to these shores to flee 
poverty or oppression, have rejoiced at their first glimpse of the 
American flag, confident that its promise of freedom, equality, and 
opportunity would prove true for them and their families.
We have carried Old Glory to places undreamed of by our founders, from 
the depths of Earth's oceans to the Sea of Tranquility on the Moon. 
Through conflict and in peace, on missions of exploration and on 
missions of mercy, the flag has led us wherever our questing spirits 
have been willing to venture, and whenever America's freedom, security, 
and values have been threatened.
On Flag Day and during National Flag Week, I encourage all Americans to 
join me in reflecting on the proud history and profound meaning of our 
flag. And let us pledge to keep faith with those generations of 
patriots, both military and civilian, who gave their lives to keep the 
flag flying over a Nation that is free, strong, and true to our highest 
ideals.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of 
each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested the President to issue an annual 
proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the Flag 
of the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress 
also requested

[[Page 87]]

the President, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966 
(80 Stat. 194), to issue annually a proclamation designating the week in 
which June 14 occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all 
citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 1997, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 8, 1997, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
suitable places.
I also call upon the people of the United States to observe with pride 
and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, 
also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor our 
Nation, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, 
and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of June, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7010 of June 12, 1997

Father's Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Raising a child is a sacred mission, and the man who welcomes this 
mission and embraces the obligations of fatherhood is someone who truly 
deserves our recognition and gratitude. On Father's Day, we honor all 
the men across our country who have affirmed the importance of 
parenthood by willingly assuming its important responsibilities.
The tight grasp of a newborn baby's tiny hand curled around his or her 
father's finger only hints at the strength of the bond that will grow in 
all the seasons of life between father and child. Caring fathers are not 
content to merely safeguard their children's physical well-being, but 
also seek to foster their spiritual and moral growth, and pass on their 
most cherished values. Mentor, teacher, coach, friend, and hero, a 
father gives his son or daughter all that his mind, his hands, and his 
heart can provide. No work is too hard, no sacrifice is too great if 
doing so will strengthen, protect, nurture, and instill joy in his 
child.
Fathers teach their children to take pride in themselves and their work, 
to assume responsibility for their lives and character, and to 
understand the rewards of sharing with others. Most important, fathers--
whether biological, adoptive, or foster--offer the strong, steady 
current of love that sustains their sons and daughters through the good 
times and bad times that all of us face.

Our Nation is blessed that so many Americans cherish the role of 
fatherhood in our families, for fathers add a crucial stability and 
strength to our lives. On Father's Day, let us honor and give thanks to 
these men who share with their children not only the precious gifts of 
life and love, but also their time, attention, and the kind of caring 
concern that lasts a lifetime.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972 (36 U.S.C. 142a), do hereby proclaim Sunday, June 15, 
1997, as Father's Day. I invite the States, communities, and citizens of 
the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities that demonstrate our deep respect and abiding affection for 
our fathers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7011 of June 30, 1997

To Implement the World Trade Organization Ministerial Declaration on 
Trade in Information Technology Products and the Agreement on Distilled 
Spirits

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

1. On December 13, 1996, the first Ministerial Meeting of the World 
Trade Organization (``the WTO'') issued a Declaration On Trade In 
Information Technology Products (``the ITA''), which established a 
framework for expanding world trade in information technology products 
and enhancing market access opportunities for such products. To 
implement that declaration, 42 WTO members and governments in the 
process of acceding to the WTO agreed to eliminate duties on information 
technology products. These products encompass computers and computer 
equipment, semiconductors and integrated circuits, computer software 
products, telecommunications equipment, semiconductor manufacturing 
equipment, and computer-based analytical instruments. The participants 
further agreed on the common objective of achieving, where appropriate, 
a common classification of such goods for tariff purposes within the 
existing nomenclature of the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding 
System (HS), and on a possible future joint suggestion to the World 
Customs Organization to update existing HS nomenclature or to otherwise 
remedy any divergence in classification of such goods or in 
interpretation of the HS nomenclature.
2. The United States and the European Union, on behalf of its 15 member 
states, also reached agreement at the WTO Ministerial Meeting on the 
elimination of duties on certain distilled spirits.

[[Page 89]]

3. Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA)(19 U.S.C. 
3521(b)) authorizes the President to proclaim the modification of any 
duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX for 
products in tariff categories that were the subject of reciprocal duty 
elimination or harmonization negotiations during the Uruguay Round, if 
the United States agrees to such action in a multilateral negotiation 
under the auspices of the WTO and after compliance with the requirements 
of section 115 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3524). The products covered by the 
ITA and the Agreement on Distilled Spirits were the subject of 
reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round.
4. Accordingly, pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have 
determined to proclaim modifications in the tariff categories and rates 
of duty set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``the HTS''), as 
set forth in the Annexes to this proclamation.
5. Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented the tariff and 
other customs treatment resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade negotiations, as set forth in Schedule XX, with respect to the 
United States. Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (``the NAFTA'') with respect to the 
United States and incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and 
rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply the 
NAFTA. Certain tariff provisions established by these proclamations, 
including staged reductions in rates of duty, and certain NAFTA rules of 
origin must be modified in light of the implementation of the ITA, to 
ensure that the previously proclaimed tariff and other customs treatment 
will be continued, and to take into account the tariff treatment 
provided for in the ITA. Accordingly, I have determined to modify the 
HTS in order to continue or provide such tariff and other customs 
treatment.
6. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (``the 1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts 
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, 
modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other 
import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 111(b) of the URAA and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do hereby 
proclaim:
    (1) In order to provide for the immediate or staged elimination of 
duties on the information technology products covered by the ITA and on 
certain distilled spirits, and to make conforming changes in other 
provisions, the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annexes to this 
proclamation.
    (2) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation shall be 
effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after the dates specified in the Annexes to this 
proclamation.
    (3) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

[[Page 90]]



IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-first.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7012 of July 18, 1997

Captive Nations Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

From its earliest days as a Nation, America has been a champion of 
freedom and human dignity. Our Declaration of Independence was a ringing 
cry against ``the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these 
States'' and affirmed the revolutionary concept that governments derive 
their powers from the free consent of those they govern. For more than 
two centuries our Bill of Rights has guaranteed such basic human rights 
as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and 
freedom from arbitrary arrest. With such a history and heritage, we can 
feel only outrage that millions of people around the world still suffer 
beneath the shadow of oppression, their rights routinely violated by 
their own governments and leaders.
Almost four decades ago, our Nation observed the first Captive Nations 
Week to express formally our solidarity with the oppressed peoples of 
the world. Since that time, thanks to our steadfast advocacy for 
democratic reform and universal human rights, and the courage and 
determination of countless men and women around the globe, the world's 
political landscape has undergone a remarkable transformation. Nations 
once dominated by the Soviet Union and its satellite governments have 
blossomed into new democracies, establishing free market economies and 
free societies that respect individual rights. Families and countrymen 
once divided by walls and barbed wire, now walk together in the fresh 
air of liberty. The unprecedented gathering of 44 countries at the Euro-
Atlantic Partnership Council meeting earlier this month in Madrid 
symbolizes how far we have come in building a stable, democratic, and 
undivided Europe.
Yet while countries like Poland, Romania, and Estonia are no longer 
among the ranks of captive nations, too many others are still held 
hostage by tyranny, and new nations still fall victim to the scourge of 
oppression. Tragically, even as the wave of freedom and democratic 
reform sweeps across Eastern and Central Europe, former Soviet bloc 
countries, and nations in South America, Asia, and Africa, there are 
still governments that derive their strength, not from the consent of 
their citizens, but from terror, repression, and exploitation. Too many 
leaders still fuel the fires of racial, ethnic, and religious hatred; 
too many people still suffer from ignorance, prejudice, and brutality.
As we observe Captive Nations Week this year, let us reaffirm our 
commitment to the American ideals of freedom and justice. Let us 
strengthen our resolve to promote respect for human rights and self-
determination for women and men of every nationality, creed, and race. 
Let us continue to speak out for those who have no voice. It is our 
Nation's obligation to do so, as the world's best hope for lasting peace 
and freedom and as a source of enduring inspiration to oppressed peoples 
everywhere.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week in July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''

[[Page 126]]


NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 20 through July 26, 1997, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to rededicate 
ourselves to supporting the cause of human rights, liberty, peace, and 
self-determination for all the peoples of the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7013 of July 24, 1997

Death of William J. Brennan, Jr.

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

As a mark of respect for the memory of William J. Brennan, Jr., former 
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, I hereby 
order, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States 
of America by section 175 of title 36 of the United States Code, that 
the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all 
public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, 
and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of 
Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and 
possessions until sunset on the day of interment. I also direct that the 
flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United 
States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities 
abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and 
stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7014 of July 25, 1997

National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

On July 27, 1953, a negotiated cease-fire brought an end to the Korean 
War and to some of the most savage fighting in the history of America's 
Armed Forces. More than 54,000 Americans lost their lives, more than 
103,000 were wounded, and thousands more were listed as missing in 
action. To

[[Page 127]]

a nation still recovering from the terrors and hardships of 
World War II, this conflict was a harsh reminder that freedom still had 
enemies at large in the world.
But the Korean War taught us that free nations could work together in 
partnership through the United Nations, standing firm against tyranny 
and in defense of liberty. We were reminded once again of the skill, 
courage, and indomitable spirit of our men and women in uniform. We 
learned that the American people were tough enough and determined enough 
to prevail in the long struggle of the Cold War.
Our victory in that struggle had its roots in the Korean War, and we owe 
our veterans of that conflict a profound debt of gratitude. Many of them 
were still scarred from the battles of World War II when they answered 
the call to duty in Korea. They fought a different kind of war in an 
unfamiliar land, facing a new and fiercely determined enemy. There they 
proved to all the enemies of freedom, and to the world, that America's 
commitment to liberty, democracy, and human rights was not only one of 
words, but also one of deeds.
Etched into the eastern wall of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in our 
Nation's Capital is the simple sentence, ``Freedom Is Not Free.'' On 
this day we honor those who recognized the truth of that inscription and 
were willing to pay freedom's price with their own lives. We salute our 
men and women in uniform who served so valiantly in the Korean War, and 
we remember with sorrow and with pride all those who never came home.
The Congress, by Public Law 104-19 (36 U.S.C. 169m), has designated July 
27, 1997, as ``National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day'' and has 
authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in 
observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 27, 1997, as National Korean War 
Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor and give thanks to 
our Nation's distinguished Korean War veterans. I also ask Federal 
departments and agencies, interested groups, organizations, and 
individuals to fly the American flag at half-staff on July 27, 1997, in 
memory of the Americans who died as a result of their service in Korea.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7015 of July 25, 1997

Parents' Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

There are few experiences in life more challenging or more rewarding 
than being a parent. Holding their child for the first time, parents 
suddenly realize that they are totally responsible for this small person 
entrusted to their care. On Parents' Day, we pay tribute to these quiet 
heroes among us--the mothers and fathers who make a lifetime commitment 
to their children.
Parents work hard to meet their children's need for food, shelter, 
clothing, and protection; but more important, they give their daughters 
and sons the deep and abiding love, guidance, attention, and 
encouragement that empowers them with the values and self-esteem to 
succeed in life. Parents love their children as they are, yet still help 
them to dream big dreams about who they can become.
The more we learn about our children, the more we realize the importance 
of good parenting. As we learned at the recent White House Conference on 
Early Childhood Development and Learning, the first few years of life 
are crucial to a child's emotional, social, and intellectual 
development. As their children's first and most influential teachers, 
parents play an immeasurably important role in helping their sons and 
daughters grow into happy and healthy adulthood.
The responsibilities of parenthood have become even more challenging in 
today's complex world. In many American families, both parents must 
work, struggling to balance the demands of job, home, and family. This 
balancing act is even harder for single parents, who must face the 
challenge of raising their children alone. In our mobile society, 
parents are often less able to rely on an extended family to help them 
provide the care and attention their children need. And today's mothers 
and fathers must protect their children from the ever-present threats of 
drugs, gangs, guns, violence, and unhealthy influences in the media and 
on the Internet.
Recognizing that good parents are the foundation of our society, my 
Administration has strived for the past 4 years to give parents the help 
they need to meet their responsibilities. I signed into law the Family 
and Medical Leave Act of 1993, and we are now proposing an expansion of 
that legislation to allow workers up to 24 hours of unpaid leave each 
year to meet family obligations. We are fighting to make our 
neighborhoods safer and drug-free and to reduce juvenile crime. We have 
expanded and improved Head Start to help parents prepare their young 
children to enter school ready to learn, and we have created an Early 
Head Start Program for children age 3 and under. We succeeded in 
requiring the installation of the V-chip and in helping to develop a 
voluntary ratings system on television so that parents can better 
protect their children from inappropriate material. And we are working 
with the computer industry to provide family-friendly controls that will 
give parents similar tools to use on the Internet.
As we observe Parents' Day this year, I urge all Americans to join me in 
paying tribute to the millions of mothers and fathers--biological and 
adoptive, foster parents and stepparents--whose boundless love and 
selfless ef-

[[Page 129]]

forts are building a better life for their children and for 
our nation. Let us repay that love and effort by striving, in our 
neighborhoods, schools, businesses, community and church organizations, 
and in government at every level, to help parents fulfill their awesome 
responsibilities and create a brighter future for America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, do 
hereby proclaim Sunday, July 27, 1997, as Parents' Day. I invite the 
States, communities, and the people of the United States to join 
together in observing this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities to honor our Nation's parents.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7016 of July 31, 1997

To Implement an Accelerated Schedule of Duty Elimination Under the North 
American Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

1. On December 17, 1992, the Governments of Canada, Mexico, and the 
United States of America entered into the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (``the NAFTA''). The NAFTA was approved by the Congress in 
section 101(a) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation 
Act (``the NAFTA Implementation Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3311(a)) and was 
implemented with respect to the United States by Proclamation 6641 of 
December 15, 1993.
2. Section 201(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3331(b)) 
authorizes the President, subject to the consultation and layover 
requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 
U.S.C. 3313(a)), to proclaim accelerated schedules for duty elimination 
that the United States may agree to with Mexico or Canada. Consistent 
with Article 302(3) of the NAFTA, I, through my duly empowered 
representative, on March 20, 1997, entered into an agreement with the 
Government of Canada and the Government of Mexico providing for an 
accelerated schedule of duty elimination for specific goods. 
Consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA 
Implementation Act with respect to such schedule of duty elimination 
have been satisfied.
3. Pursuant to section 201(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, I have 
determined that the modifications hereinafter proclaimed of duties on 
goods originating in the territory of a NAFTA party are necessary or 
appropriate to (i) maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually 
advantageous concessions with respect to Canada and Mexico provided for 
by the

[[Page 130]]

NAFTA and (ii) to carry out the agreement with Canada and Mexico 
providing an accelerated schedule of duty elimination for specific 
goods.
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483) 
(``the Trade Act''), authorizes the President to embody in the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``the HTS'') the 
substance of the relevant provisions of acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 
201(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act and section 604 of the Trade Act, 
do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to provide for an accelerated schedule of duty 
elimination for specific goods, the tariff treatment set forth in the 
HTS for certain NAFTA originating goods is modified as provided in the 
Annex to this proclamation.
    (2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (3) The amendments made to the HTS by the Annex to this proclamation 
shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse for consumption, on or after July 1, 1997.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

 Proclamation 7017 of August 19, 1997

Women's Equality Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Each year, on Women's Equality Day, we reflect on how far we have 
traveled on our journey to make America live up to the ideals of justice 
and equality articulated so powerfully in the Declaration of 
Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. Few 
constitutional amendments have affected that progress more profoundly 
than the 19th, which guarantees American women the right to vote.
Looking back from today's vantage point, where women hold positions of 
authority and responsibility at almost every level of government, it is 
hard to imagine that, for almost a century and a half, women were barred 
from exercising the most fundamental right of every democracy. There are 
women still living among us who can remember a time when they were 
prevented, by law, from having a role in shaping the destiny of their 
country and the impact of government on their own and their families' 
lives. But thanks to women and men of extraordinary courage and 
conviction, who waged for years a determined campaign for women's 
suffrage, the 19th Amendment was ratified in August of 1920 and opened 
the door for generations of American women to add their vision and 
voices to our national discourse.
This year, we mark another milestone in the life of our democracy: the 
25th anniversary of the enactment of Title IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972. Title IX, building on the spirit of the 19th 
Amendment, prohibits discrimination against women in education and 
sports programs. For a quarter-century, it has enabled American girls 
and women to make the most of their abilities, to dream big dreams, and, 
more important, to achieve those dreams. In large measure, because of 
the 19th Amendment and Title IX, our Nation has reaped the rewards of 
women's talents, accomplishments, wisdom, and perspective. In every 
activity and profession, in the home and outside--as astronauts and 
professional athletes, as teachers and university presidents, as farmers 
and firefighters, as caregivers, Cabinet members, and Supreme Court 
Justices--women have made lasting contributions to the quality of our 
lives and the strength of our democracy.
Today, as Americans engage in a serious and profoundly important 
dialogue on the future of our multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural 
society, we do well to remember that we are all immeasurably enriched 
when we choose the path of inclusion and empowerment. Women's Equality 
Day and the anniversary of Title IX remind us that by demanding an equal 
opportunity for every American, we ensure a brighter future for all 
Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 1997, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the citizens of our great Nation to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 7018 of September 8, 1997

America Goes Back to School, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Americans want the best for our children. We want them to live out their 
dreams, empowered with the tools they need to make the most of their 
lives and to build a future where America remains the world's beacon of 
hope and freedom and opportunity. To do this, we must all make improving 
the quality of education in America one of our highest priorities.
In my State of the Union Address earlier this year, I issued a call to 
action for American education to prepare our Nation for the 21st 
century. Working together, we must make our schools strong and safe, 
with clear standards of achievement and discipline and talented, 
dedicated teachers in every classroom. Every school and every State 
should adopt rigorous national standards, with national tests in 4th-
grade reading and 8th-grade math to make sure our children master the 
basics. We must ensure that every student can read independently and 
well by the end of the 3rd grade. We must connect every classroom and 
library to the Internet by the year 2000 and help all students become 
technologically literate. We must modernize school buildings and expand 
school choice and accountability in public education. And we must 
encourage lifelong learning for all our citizens, from expanding Head 
Start programs to helping adults improve their education and skills.
These goals are ambitious, but they are crucial if we are to prepare for 
the challenges and possibilities of life in the 21st century. With the 
1997 balanced budget agreement, we will begin to meet these goals by 
providing new resources to help children learn to read, the means to 
help connect every school to the Internet, and tens of billions of 
dollars in tax cuts to help families pay for college.
I urge all Americans to become actively involved in their local schools 
and colleges and to make a real commitment to support education 
improvement and give our children the kind of support they need to 
succeed. The Partnership for Family Involvement in Education is setting 
a powerful example in this endeavor. These partners--including the 
Department of Education and more than 3,000 schools, families, colleges 
and universities, community, cultural, and religious groups, businesses, 
elected officials and policymakers, and the men and women of our Armed 
Forces--have pledged their support for our initiative, ``America Goes 
Back to School: Answering the President's Call to Action.'' Through 
their dedication to our children, they are helping America's young 
people grow into responsible and productive

[[Page 135]]
citizens. They are proving 
that when communities unite, every student can achieve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 8 through 
September 14, 1997, as a time when America Goes Back to School. I 
encourage parents, schools, community and State leaders, businesses, 
civic and religious organizations, and the people of the United States 
to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
expressing support for high academic standards and meaningful 
involvement in schools and colleges and the students and families they 
serve.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.

Proclamation 7019 of September 12, 1997

National Week of Food Recovery, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

The American people are blessed with rich natural resources and an 
agricultural sector that is the most efficient and productive in the 
world. It is a tragic reality, however, that in this land of plenty, 
many of our fellow Americans still go hungry each day. This statistic 
becomes even more heartbreaking when we realize that about 27 percent of 
the estimated 356 billion pounds of food that America produces each year 
goes to waste at the retail, wholesale, and consumer levels.
Most of this loss occurs in the commercial food chain, as food travels 
from farms to wholesale markets, manufacturers, supermarkets, company 
cafeterias, and restaurants, and much of it is recoverable. Whether it 
be day-old bread at a bakery or an extra pan of lasagna not served by a 
restaurant or cafeteria, a significant amount of this food is perfectly 
edible and wholesome. Throwing away such food is an intolerable loss, 
because it both denies hungry Americans a vital source of nourishment 
and wastes precious resources. Municipalities across the country 
currently spend about $1 billion a year in tax dollars to dispose of 
excess food.
There is a growing national movement to recover this food and distribute 
it to Americans in need. This movement, led by nonprofit groups and 
energized by new efforts at the Department of Agriculture, is making a 
noticeable difference in the amount of edible excess food that is 
finding its way to hungry people rather than ending up in dumpsters.
Every sector of our society--from individuals to large institutions--can 
do more to glean and recover excess food. Every person can have an 
impact. Individuals can donate canned and boxed goods to food drives; 
they can give their time and money to food recovery organizations; they 
can even

[[Page 136]]
encourage the places where they work--and the businesses they 
patronize--to get involved in this movement.
Food recovery efforts will never replace a strong Federal safety net 
that includes such critical programs as the Food Stamp Program; the 
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children; 
the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs; and nutrition 
education efforts. However, extra food, provided through food recovery, 
can serve as a vital supplement to the diets of millions of Americans in 
need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 14 through September 20, 1997, as 
National Week of Food Recovery, to be held in conjunction with the 
National Summit on Food Recovery. I call on all Americans to observe 
this week by actively participating in and supporting efforts to recover 
food for distribution to hungry Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7020 of September 12, 1997

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Throughout our history, America's promise of individual freedom and 
opportunity has drawn millions upon millions of immigrants from across 
the globe. As these newcomers arrived, they gradually wove their own 
traditions into the tapestry of our Nation's culture and society. The 
world's economy is becoming ever more interdependent and competitive, 
and these changes and others brought on by the revolution in 
communication technologies are lowering many of the old barriers to 
economic, cultural, and intellectual exchange among nations. In this new 
global community, we benefit greatly from the contributions that 
Hispanic Americans bring to our economy and our society.
As the youngest and fastest-growing segment of our population, Hispanic 
Americans are an increasingly vital part of our economy. In the first 3 
years of our Administration, more than 220,000 Hispanic-American-owned 
businesses were created, and in recent years the number of companies 
owned by Hispanic women, in particular, has grown at three times the 
overall rate of business growth. Our citizens with roots in South and 
Central America, the Caribbean, and Spain have inherited an 
entrepreneurial spirit and an intense work ethic that have helped 
energize the strongest American economy in a generation. The new head of 
the Small Business Administration, Aida Alvarez, is a symbol of that 
spirit and its importance to America. Along with Secretary of Energy 
Federico Pena, Under Secretary of Agriculture I. Miley Gonzales, and 
Ambassador Bill Richardson, the United

[[Page 137]]
States Representative to the 
United Nations, Administrator Alvarez reflects my Administration's 
continuing commitment to bring highly qualified Hispanic Americans into 
the highest levels of Government.
Our Hispanic citizens also are vital to America's success in expanding 
trade and developing closer ties with nations throughout the Western 
Hemisphere. Sharing a rich cultural and linguistic heritage with 
Hispanic Americans, these nations are already among our closest trading 
partners, and we hope to further expand our relationships with them at 
the Summit of the Americas next March.
The contributions of Hispanic Americans to the life of our Nation are 
much more than economic. Their strong commitment to family, community, 
and country sets a shining example for all our people. Generations of 
Hispanic Americans have served and sacrificed in America's Armed Forces 
to defend liberty and advance democracy throughout the world. And 
Hispanic culture continues to deeply enrich our social, intellectual, 
and artistic life.
To meet the challenges of the 21st century, we must create a society 
that offers opportunity to all Americans, requires responsibility from 
all Americans, and nurtures a community of all Americans. Hispanic 
Americans throughout our country are working to build such a society. To 
honor them for their dedication to this endeavor and for their many 
contributions to our Nation and our culture, the Congress, by Public Law 
100-402, has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a 
proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as ``National 
Hispanic Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 1997, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon all government officials, 
educators, and the people of the United States to honor this observance 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and I encourage 
all Americans to rededicate themselves to the pursuit of equality.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.

Proclamation 7021 of September 15, 1997

50th Anniversary of the National Security Act of 1947

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

The United States emerged from the crucible of World War II to face a 
political and military landscape changed forever by the events of that 
conflict. The Soviet Union, a vital ally during the war, was fast 
becoming an actively hostile and dangerous opponent. And, as the most 
economically and militarily powerful nation on earth, the United States 
bore the awesome re-

[[Page 138]]
sponsibility of preventing the onset of another and 
even more destructive world war.
Recognizing these harsh new realities, and wise in the hard lessons of 
recent history, President Truman and America's other civilian and 
military leaders determined to create the structures and programs that 
would guarantee our national security and promote lasting world peace. 
The result of their efforts was the National Security Act of 1947. This 
single historic piece of legislation created four extraordinary 
institutions that continue to serve America superbly a half-century 
later: the Department of Defense, the United States Air Force, the 
Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Council.
The complex task of coordinating the operations of ground, sea, and air 
forces during World War II demonstrated the need for unified direction 
of America's Armed Forces in the postwar world. The National Security 
Act answered that need by establishing the Department of Defense. Under 
the civilian control of the Secretary of Defense, and fortified by the 
collective experience, knowledge, and strategic guidance of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, the three military departments within the Department of 
Defense--the Army, Navy, and Air Force--began to work together as a 
powerful team to integrate the operation and administration of all our 
Nation's Armed Forces.
Today, the Department of Defense has realized in large measure the 
objectives stated in the National Security Act. The Armed Forces and the 
unified commands have achieved a remarkable degree of integration in 
organization and operations and remain the best-trained, best-equipped, 
and best-prepared fighting force in the world. Our men and women in 
uniform stand ready to preserve America's freedom and protect our 
national interests whenever and wherever they are threatened.
The Second World War also proved the critical importance of air power to 
the defense of our Nation. With the creation of the United States Air 
Force as an independent armed service within the Department of Defense, 
the National Security Act helped to ensure America's mastery of the 
skies. In the subsequent 50 years, the courage and dedication of the men 
and women of the United States Air Force have been a constant source of 
pride and reassurance to the American people.
With equal devotion, the men and women of the Central Intelligence 
Agency have enabled America to meet the challenges of global leadership 
for the past half-century. Providing ten Presidents and their 
administrations with the strategic intelligence to make informed 
decisions vital to the security of our Nation, these dedicated public 
servants helped America to fight and win the Cold War. Today, in a world 
no longer burdened by superpower confrontation, they remain vigilant in 
the face of more diffuse and complex dangers: from aggression by rogue 
states and terrorism to the spread of weapons of mass destruction and 
international drug trafficking.
In creating the National Security Council, the National Security Act of 
1947 provided the President with an invaluable forum for the 
consideration and coordination of domestic, foreign, and military 
policies related to America's security. Supporting the President, his 
Cabinet, and his other close advisors with sound judgment, analysis, and 
advice, the men and women of the National Security Council can reflect 
with pride on five decades of unparalleled service to our Nation. 
Through the East-West confrontations of

[[Page 139]]
the Cold War to the threshold of 
the 21st century, the National Security Council has played a vital role 
in protecting our Nation's security and in preparing us for the 
challenges of the future.
As we observe the 50th anniversary of the National Security Act of 1947, 
we pay tribute to the vision and determination of a generation of 
American civilian and military leaders. Working together, they 
established the remarkable institutions we celebrate this week; 
institutions that have helped to secure the peace and prosperity that 
America enjoys today. The success of their efforts and of the historic 
legislation enacted half a century ago is reflected in an outstanding 
record of achievement: nuclear war averted, the Cold War won, and the 
nations of the world turning to democracy and free markets.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 14 through September 20, 1997, as 
a time to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the National Security Act 
of 1947. I call upon all Americans to observe this anniversary with 
appropriate programs and activities celebrating the accomplishments of 
this legislation and honoring the service and sacrifice of the thousands 
of dedicated Americans who have strived to carry out its mandate for the 
past five decades.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7022 of September 16, 1997

Citizenship Day and Constitution Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Of all the dates in American history, one of the most important is 
perhaps the least well-known--September 17, 1787. On that day, our 
Nation's Founders signed the Constitution of the United States, a 
document that has steadily grown in stature throughout the world as a 
model for democratic government under the rule of law.
As with most human enterprises, the Constitution was the product of 
compromise. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention brought with 
them to Philadelphia conflicting local and regional concerns, differing 
viewpoints, fears of creating a government that was either too powerful 
or too weak. When the convention seemed close to dissolving with nothing 
accomplished, Benjamin Franklin reminded his fellow delegates that 
history would judge them harshly if they failed in this great experiment 
of self-government: ``. . . [M]ankind may hereafter, from this 
unfortunate instance, despair of establishing governments by human 
wisdom, and leave it to chance, war and conquest.''

[[Page 140]]

But human wisdom did prevail. The delegates devised a framework for 
democracy with an ingenious design of checks and balances, broad 
protection of individual rights, and a mechanism for amendment to ensure 
that it would be able to respond to the ever-changing needs of our 
people. This remarkable document has rightly earned the world's 
admiration for its success in combining structural solidity with 
practical adaptability--a combination that has served our Nation through 
times of rapid change as well as times of stability.
We can measure that success by the thousands of men, women, and children 
who travel to our shores each year, seeking a chance to live out their 
dreams. Many of them know what life can be like without the blessings of 
our Constitution, and their experience is a powerful reminder to us of 
the importance of protecting the Constitution if we are to preserve 
freedom for ourselves and for the generations of Americans to follow. We 
can also learn much from their deep desire for American citizenship and 
their enthusiasm to embrace not only its privileges, but also its 
responsibilities--knowledge of and respect for our laws, a willingness 
to exercise their vote, and reverence for the fundamental American 
values of freedom, tolerance, and equality.
But today American citizenship requires more. At the Presidents' Summit 
for America's Future in Philadelphia this past April, I joined with Vice 
President Gore; former Presidents Ford, Carter, and Bush; General Colin 
Powell; and other national and community leaders in calling for a 
redefinition of American citizenship--a definition that includes a 
profound commitment to community service. Each of us must look into our 
own neighborhoods and communities and reach out to help our fellow 
Americans succeed. We can only fulfill America's bright promise of 
freedom and opportunity by ensuring that every citizen shares in that 
promise.
In commemorating the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the importance of active, responsible citizenship to preserve its 
blessings for our Nation, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 
29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 153), designated September 17 as ``Citizenship 
Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 159), 
requested the President to proclaim the week beginning September 17 and 
ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 1997, as Citizenship Day and 
September 17 through September 23, 1997, as Constitution Week. I call 
upon Federal, State, and local officials, as well as leaders of civic, 
educational, and religious organizations, to conduct meaningful 
ceremonies and programs in our schools, churches, and other community 
centers to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of the 
Constitution and the rights and duties of citizenship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7023 of September 16, 1997

 National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Throughout our Nation's history, the men and women of America's Armed 
Forces have preserved our freedom, protected our security, and upheld 
our democratic values. From the battles of the American Revolution 
through the crucible of two world wars to the challenging peacekeeping 
and humanitarian missions of today's post-Cold War era, our men and 
women in uniform have stood proudly in defense of the United States and 
in the cause of liberty. In the two centuries since our Nation's birth, 
more than a million have paid the price of that liberty with their 
lives.
Joining the ranks of these heroes are the thousands who have been held 
as prisoners of war or whose fate has never been resolved. Many have 
been lost in the chaos of battle, the grief of their loss made more 
acute for their families and their fellow Americans because of the 
inability to determine whether they perished or survived. Captive 
Americans, cruelly stripped of their freedom, treated with contempt and 
brutality, or used as pawns by their captors in a larger political 
struggle, have fought long, lonely battles against despair, physical and 
psychological torture, and the ultimate fear of being forgotten.
But Americans will never forget those who have borne the indignities and 
sufferings of captivity in service to our country, those missing in 
action, or those who died as prisoners of war, far from home and family. 
On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we reaffirm our commitment to those 
still missing and renew our pledge to make every effort to obtain the 
answers to their fate. We can do no less for these American heroes and 
for their families, who have endured such profound loss and whose 
suffering continues as long as their loved ones' fate remains unknown.
On September 19, 1997, the flag of the National League of Families of 
American Prisoners of War and Missing in Southeast Asia will be flown 
over the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Departments of State, 
Defense, and Veterans Affairs, the Selective Service System 
Headquarters, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean War Veterans 
Memorial, and national cemeteries across our country. This black and 
white banner, symbolizing America's missing, is a stark and powerful 
reminder to people around the world that our Nation will keep faith with 
those who have served and sacrificed; that we will not rest until we 
receive the fullest possible accounting of every American missing in 
service to our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, by virtue of the authority vested 
in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
proclaim September 19, 1997, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I ask 
all Americans to join me in honoring former American prisoners of war 
and those whose fate is still undetermined. I also encourage the 
American people to remember with special sympathy and concern the 
courageous families who maintain their steadfast vigil and who persevere 
in their search for answers and for the peace that comes only with 
certainty. Finally, I call upon State and local officials and private 
organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.

Proclamation 7024 of September 19, 1997

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

The American economy today is the envy of the world. Since the beginning 
of my Administration, our economy has created nearly 13 million new 
jobs, unemployment has declined to 4.9 percent, and America has once 
again become the world's leading exporter.
Minority entrepreneurs have played a vital role in this success story. 
With their faith in our free enterprise system, their determination to 
overcome any barriers to success, their willingness to work long and 
hard and to make the most of every opportunity, they epitomize the 
American can-do spirit. They create jobs in communities where jobs are 
most needed, and they set a powerful example of achievement for young 
people seeking to make the most of their lives.
In the years ahead, these minority business men and business women will 
become increasingly important to our Nation's competitive edge in the 
global economy, which will offer great rewards to those who truly 
understand life beyond our borders. Because of their racial, linguistic, 
and cultural diversity, minority entrepreneurs are uniquely positioned 
to meet the needs of this dynamic international marketplace.
Recognizing the contributions that minority enterprises make to the 
social and economic fabric of our Nation, we must continue to remove any 
barriers that prevent talented men and women of every racial and ethnic 
background from participating fully in America's economic mainstream. 
Working in partnership, government and private industry must ensure that 
minority-owned firms have equal access to capital, technical assistance, 
new markets, and opportunities for growth. We must attract new 
entrepreneurs to the marketplace and encourage existing firms to expand. 
By doing so, we can ensure that America's promise will continue to shine 
brightly for all our people.
As we observe Minority Enterprise Development Week, let us honor the 
energy, determination, and optimism of our Nation's minority 
entrepreneurs, whose hard work has done so much to help keep America 
strong, prosperous, and full of hope for the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 21 through 
September 27, 1997, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call on 
all Americans to commemorate this event with appropriate cere-

[[Page 143]]
monies and 
activities in acknowledgment of the many contributions that minority 
entrepreneurs bring to our national life.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.

Proclamation 7025 of September 19, 1997

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

We are a few short years away from the dawn of the 21st century, yet 
much of the challenge and change we have been anticipating is already 
upon us. We are competing today in a truly global economy, an economy 
based on information and technology as well as agriculture and industry. 
We are living in the age of the information revolution, the era of the 
World Wide Web, of daily advances in communications technology where a 
universe of knowledge is only a keyboard and a modem away. We are 
crossing the frontier into a new world, and our only map and compass in 
that world will be education.
We must build an educational system that prepares our young people for 
the jobs of the future. We must empower them with the values, 
experiences, and self-confidence to succeed in our diverse society. We 
must provide them with the knowledge and motivation to reach their full 
human potential--and we must leave no one behind. In devising such an 
educational system, we need only look to America's Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for a model of excellence.
This extraordinary network of institutions, more than a century old, has 
created a legacy of unquestioned accomplishment in fostering student 
success. Founded to educate African Americans in a segregated society, 
these colleges and universities have flourished and built an enviable 
record of achievement in educating America's black scientists, doctors, 
teachers, lawyers, artists, entrepreneurs, community and religious 
leaders, and other professionals. They have provided generations of 
students with access to highly supportive environments for learning. The 
experience and expertise of HBCUs make them an invaluable resource to 
our Nation during this period of significant change.
America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities daily demonstrate 
effective leadership in a multitude of ways: they develop and practice 
innovative academic approaches to ensure student success; they create 
campus programs that offer new solutions to critical social problems; 
they produce cutting-edge research with practical applications; and they 
forge strong global relationships from a myriad of international 
activities. Moreover, against formidable financial odds, they have 
persisted in keeping education

[[Page 144]]
affordable for the constituencies they 
serve, without sacrificing quality. They have never allowed scarce 
funding, poor educational preparation, or societal disadvantage to get 
in the way of their mission to educate and nurture the intellectual 
potential of the black community.
Historically Black Colleges and Universities have done more to make the 
American Dream a reality for African Americans than has any other set of 
institutions in our country. These institutions are poised to enter the 
21st century, ready to build on this tradition of excellence, 
achievement, and reverence for education. We can count on them to 
continue to make vital contributions to our Nation's success and to 
ensure that America lives up to our fundamental values of equality and 
opportunity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 21 through 
September 27, 1997, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon the people of the United States, 
including government officials, educators, and administrators, to 
observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities 
honoring America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities and 
their graduates.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

From the earliest days of our Nation, the men and women who work the 
land have held a special place in America's heart, history, and economy. 
Many of us are no more than a few generations removed from forebears 
whose determination and hard work on farms and fields helped to build 
our Nation and shape its values. While the portion of our population 
directly involved in agriculture has diminished over the years, those 
who live and work on America's farms and ranches continue to make 
extraordinary contributions to the quality of our national life and the 
strength of our economy.
The life of a farmer or rancher has never been easy. The work is hard, 
physically challenging, and uniquely subject to the forces of nature; 
the chemicals and labor-saving machinery that have helped American 
farmers become so enormously productive have also brought with them new 
health hazards; and working with livestock can result in frequent injury 
to agricultural workers and their families.
Fortunately, there are measures we can take to reduce agriculture-
related injuries, illnesses, and deaths. Manufacturers continue to 
improve the safe-

[[Page 145]]
ty features of farming equipment; protective clothing 
and safety gear can reduce the exposure of workers to the health threats 
posed by chemicals, noise, dust, and sun; training in first-aid 
procedures and access to good health care can often mean the difference 
between life and death.
The key to all these safety measures is education. During National Farm 
Safety and Health Week, I encourage America's farmers, ranchers, and 
other agricultural workers to remain alert to the dangers inherent in 
their livelihood. By learning about and using the latest safety features 
of farming equipment and vehicles, wearing personal protective gear and 
clothing, and practicing good preventive health care, they can avoid or 
reduce many of the hazards they face each day. It is particularly 
important to teach our young people on farms and ranches about proper 
safety measures, to provide safe areas where children can play, and to 
monitor their activities. Their experience and maturity must always be 
considered before they are allowed to participate in farm or ranch work.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 21 through 
September 27, 1997, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
government agencies, educational institutions, businesses, and 
professional associations that serve our agricultural sector to 
strengthen efforts to promote safety and health measures among our 
Nation's farm and ranch workers. I ask agricultural workers to take 
advantage of available technology, training, and information that can 
help them prevent injury and illness. I also call upon all Americans to 
observe Wednesday, September 24, 1997, as a day to focus on the risks 
facing young people on our Nation's farms and ranches and to reflect 
during this week on the bounty that we enjoy thanks to the hard work and 
dedication of America's agricultural workers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7027 of September 25, 1997

Austrian-American Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

For more than 200 years, the life of our Nation has been enriched and 
renewed by the many people who have come here from around the world, 
seeking a new life for themselves and their families. Austrian Americans 
have made their own unique and lasting contributions to America's 
strength and character, and they continue to play a vital role in the 
peace and prosperity we enjoy today.
As with so many other immigrants, the earliest Austrians came to America 
in search of religious freedom. Arriving in 1734, they settled in the 
colony

[[Page 146]]
of Georgia, growing and prospering with the passing of the years. 
One of these early Austrian settlers, Johann Adam Treutlen, was to 
become the first elected governor of the new State of Georgia.
In the two centuries that followed, millions of other Austrians made the 
same journey to our shores. From the political refugees of the 1848 
revolutions in Austria to Jews fleeing the anti-Semitism of Hitler's 
Third Reich, Austrians brought with them to America a love of freedom, a 
strong work ethic, and a deep reverence for education. In every field of 
endeavor, Austrian Americans have made notable contributions to our 
culture and society. We have all been enriched by the lives and 
achievements of such individuals as Supreme Court Justice Felix 
Frankfurter; Joel Elias Spingarn, who helped to found the NAACP; 
psychiatrist and educator Alexandra Adler; lyricist Frederick Loewe, who 
helped to transform American musical theater; and architects John 
Smithmeyer and Richard Neutra.
Americans of Austrian descent have also helped to nurture the strong 
ties of friendship between the United States and Austria, a friendship 
that has survived the upheaval of two World Wars and the subsequent 
division of Europe between the forces of East and West. On September 26, 
1945, a conference was convened in Vienna among the nine Austrian 
Federal States that helped to unify the nation and paved the way for 
recognition by the United States and the Allied Forces of the first 
postwar Provisional Austrian Government. Setting the date for the first 
free national elections, this important meeting laid the foundation for 
the strong, prosperous, and independent Austria we know today.
In recognition of the significance of this date to the relationship 
between our Nation and the Federal Republic of Austria, and in gratitude 
for the many gifts that Austrian Americans bring to the life of our 
country, it is appropriate that we pause to celebrate Austrian-American 
Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, by virtue of the authority vested 
in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
proclaim Friday, September 26, 1997, as Austrian-American Day. I 
encourage all Americans to recognize and celebrate the important 
contributions that millions of Americans of Austrian descent have made--
and continue to make--to our Nation's strength and prosperity.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7028 of September 25, 1997

Gold Star Mother's Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

As a free people, Americans have always sought to live our lives in 
peace; but history's harsh lessons have taught us that to remain free, 
we must be

[[Page 147]]
prepared for war. At many times and in many ways throughout 
the year, we remember the millions of selfless Americans whose wartime 
service helped preserve our freedom and the values we hold dear; and it 
is fitting that we should do so. But we must also remember that not all 
of the sacrifices that sustained us were made on the battlefield.
Long after the devastation of war ceases, the destruction left in its 
wake continues to afflict those who survive. For America's Gold Star 
Mothers--who have lost a child in the service of our country--the grief 
is particularly acute. The sons and daughters they cherished through the 
years, whom they guided and comforted through all the joys and 
heartaches of childhood and adolescence, were torn from their lives 
forever with cruel and sudden force. These mothers must live the rest of 
their lives knowing that the talents and ambitions of their children 
will never be fulfilled, that each family gathering or celebration will 
be shadowed by the absence of a dearly loved son or daughter.
Yet despite the enormity of their loss, America's Gold Star Mothers have 
continued to do what comes naturally to mothers: to comfort, to nurture, 
to give of themselves for the benefit of others. Through their devotion 
to our disabled veterans and their families, their generous community 
service, and their dedication to preserving the memory of the fallen, 
Gold Star Mothers remind us in so many poignant ways that true love of 
country often calls for both service and sacrifice.
For these reasons and more, and in recognition of the special burden 
that Gold Star Mothers bear on behalf of all of us, we set aside this 
day each year to honor and thank them and to rededicate ourselves to 
creating a world in which the kind of sacrifice they have been called 
upon to make need never be repeated. The Congress, by Senate Joint 
Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1895), has designated the last 
Sunday in September as ``Gold Star Mother's Day'' and has authorized and 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 28, 1997, as Gold Star 
Mother's Day. I call upon all government officials to display the United 
States flag on government buildings on this solemn day. I encourage the 
American people also to display the flag and to hold appropriate 
meetings in their homes, places of worship, or other suitable places as 
a public expression of the sympathy and respect that our Nation holds 
for our Gold Star Mothers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7029 of October 1, 1997

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Every year we dedicate the month of October to focus on breast cancer 
and to reaffirm our national commitment to eradicate it. But for 
thousands of American women and their families and friends, breast 
cancer is a devastating reality that casts a shadow over their lives 
every day. In this decade alone, nearly half a million women will die of 
breast cancer, and more than 1.5 million new cases of the disease will 
be diagnosed.
Our greatest weapon in the crusade against breast cancer is knowledge; 
knowledge of its causes and knowledge about prevention and treatment. My 
Administration has established a National Action Plan on Breast Cancer 
to unite organizations across the country in a collaborative effort to 
find out more about the disease and how best to respond to it.
The Department of Health and Human Services is taking the lead in this 
national effort, through education and research at the National Cancer 
Institute and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research; through 
nationwide screening and detection programs at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention; through certification of mammography facilities 
by the Food and Drug Administration; through prevention services and 
treatment by health benefit programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; and 
through increased access to clinical treatment trials for cancer 
patients who are beneficiaries in Department of Defense and Department 
of Veterans Affairs programs. The Department of Defense has also 
initiated a breast cancer research program to reduce the incidence of 
breast cancer, increase survival rates, and improve the quality of life 
for women diagnosed with the disease.
We can be proud of the progress we have made. One of the most promising 
recent research achievements is our increased understanding of the role 
of genetics in the cancer process. We have learned that cancer is a 
disease of altered genes and altered gene function, and research into 
the relationship between breast cancer and genes is helping us to better 
understand the basis of the disease. However, we must ensure that 
progress in genetic information is used only to advance and to improve 
the Nation's health--not as a basis for discrimination. That is why this 
year I have urged the Congress to pass a law that prevents health 
insurance plans from discriminating against individuals on the basis of 
genetic information.
High-quality mammography has also proved to be a powerfully effective 
tool in the effort to detect breast cancer in its earliest, most 
treatable stage. The National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer 
Society, and many other professional organizations agree that women in 
their forties benefit from mammography screening, and earlier this year 
I was pleased to sign legislation that will help Medicare beneficiaries 
with cost-sharing for annual screening mammograms. The First Lady has 
also launched an annual campaign to encourage older women to use the 
Medicare mammography screening benefits.

[[Page 149]]
We have real cause for celebration during National Breast Cancer 
Awareness Month this year: recent data show that the breast cancer rate 
for American women is declining. Heartened by this knowledge, let us 
reaffirm our commitment to the crusade against breast cancer. Let us 
ensure that all women know about the dangers of breast cancer, are 
informed about the lifesaving potential of early detection, receive 
recommended screening services, and have access to health care services 
and information. Let us continue to move research forward to improve 
treatments and find a cure for this disease. Working together, we can 
look forward to the day when our mothers, wives, daughters, sisters, and 
friends can live long, healthy lives, free from the specter of breast 
cancer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1997 as National 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and all the people of the United States to reflect on the 
progress we have made in advancing our knowledge about breast cancer and 
to publicly reaffirm our national commitment to controlling and curing 
this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7030 of October 1, 1997

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

In observing the month of October as National Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month, the American people reaffirm our commitment to prevent 
and eliminate violence against women. Domestic violence is not simply a 
private family matter--it is a matter affecting the entire community.
Too many of America's homes have become places where women, children, 
and seniors suffer physical abuse and emotional trauma. Domestic 
violence is a leading cause of injury to women in our country, and it 
occurs among all racial, ethnic, religious, and economic groups. It is a 
particularly devastating form of abuse because it wears a familiar face: 
the face of a spouse, parent, or partner. This violence too often 
extends beyond the home and into the workplace.
My Administration is committed to ending this violence and to protecting 
women in all aspects of their lives, whether in the home, in the 
community, or in the workplace. In 1994, I fought for passage of the 
Violence Against Women Act, which combined tough new penalties for 
offenders with funding for much-needed shelters, counseling services, 
public education, and research to help the victims of violence. The 
Federal penalties

[[Page 150]]
and prevention efforts included in this legislation 
have improved our ability to deter crimes of domestic violence.
Early in my Administration, as outlined in the landmark Crime Bill, I 
established the Office of Violence Against Women in the Department of 
Justice to lead our comprehensive national effort to combine tough 
Federal laws with assistance to States and localities to fight domestic 
violence and other crimes against women. In February 1996, the 
Department of Health and Human Services launched the 24-hour-a-day, 
toll-free National Domestic Violence Hotline, 1-800-797-SAFE, so that 
those in trouble can find out how to get emergency help, find shelter, 
or report abuse. To date, the hotline has received more than 118,000 
calls from all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. We also initiated an Advisory Council on Violence 
Against Women to bring together experts in the field, including 
representatives from law enforcement, business, health and human 
services, and advocates, to focus national attention on successful, 
multifaceted solutions to combating violence and sexual assault.
We cannot simply rest on past efforts. My Administration is continuing 
its work to prevent domestic violence and to care for survivors in their 
communities and workplaces. We are committed to strengthening the health 
care system's ability to screen, treat, prevent, and eliminate family 
violence by supporting training of health care providers and projects to 
assist those in the substance abuse field to address domestic violence. 
We are working to improve collaboration between human services 
providers, advocates, and the criminal justice community to enhance 
responses to domestic violence. The Department of Health and Human 
Services is sponsoring projects and programs to coordinate community 
responses to domestic violence, to focus on youth and children who 
witness violence, and to link child protection services with community 
providers who work with abused women and their children.
Finally, as a further enhancement of my 1995 directive to all Federal 
departments and agencies to conduct employee awareness campaigns on 
domestic violence, the Office of Personnel Management is producing a 
guide to help agency representatives develop programs to prevent and 
respond to all types of workplace violence against Federal employees, 
including domestic violence. This guide, drafted by experts in the areas 
of mental health, investigations, law enforcement, threat assessment, 
and employee relations, will serve as a useful tool in providing step-
by-step information to identify, prevent, and respond to violence so 
that we can protect those in the Federal work force.
I encourage the private sector to expand its role in preventing and 
eliminating domestic violence. We must also strengthen coordinated 
efforts between the public and private sectors to combat domestic 
violence in the home, the community, and the workplace. These efforts 
must ensure that no survivor of domestic violence lives in isolation and 
that the families of victims also have our support. No child should have 
to live in an abusive home. No woman should live in fear in her home, on 
the streets, or on the job. Only through a national commitment to this 
effort can we stop domestic violence and ensure that its survivors are 
safe.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1997 as Na-

[[Page 151]]
tional Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, law 
enforcement agencies, health professionals, educators, community 
leaders, and the American people to join together to end the domestic 
violence that threatens so many of our people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7031 of October 2, 1997

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

America has always been blessed with abundant natural resources; but we 
sometimes fail to recognize that we have been blessed with rich human 
resources as well. Millions of people in thousands of professions have 
built this great country with their labor and made a reality of the 
American Dream for themselves and their families. But for 20 percent of 
our population, that dream has too often been deferred or denied. 
Americans with disabilities have had to overcome barriers in 
communication, transportation, architecture, and attitude to take their 
rightful place in our Nation's work force.
If America is to continue to grow and prosper, if we are to lead the 
challenging global economy of the 21st century, we cannot afford to 
ignore the talents, energy, and creativity of the 54 million Americans 
with disabilities. Thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act, we are 
making significant progress in eliminating workplace discrimination and 
ensuring equal job opportunities for people with disabilities. This 
landmark civil rights legislation, enacted 7 years ago with bipartisan 
support, has opened doors and brought down barriers across our country 
for people with disabilities. It has empowered them with the opportunity 
to become employees, taxpayers, and active participants in the life of 
their communities.
To build on this progress, government at every level must work in 
partnership with business, labor, and community organizations to ensure 
that all Americans, regardless of disability, can live and learn and 
work alongside their fellow citizens. Only when we guarantee the 
inclusion, empowerment, and independence of all our people will America 
fulfill its great promise of freedom and opportunity.
To recognize the full potential of individuals with disabilities and to 
encourage all Americans to work toward their full integration into the 
work force, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 11, 1945, 
as amended (36 U.S.C. 155), has designated October of each year as 
``National Disability Employment Awareness Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 1997 as National Disability


[[Page 152]]
Employment Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, educators, 
labor leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe 
this month with appropriate programs and activities that reaffirm our 
determination to achieve the full integration into the work force of 
people with disabilities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7032 of October 3, 1997

Fire Prevention Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Of all the disasters that confront Americans every year, few cause more 
loss of life and property than fire. Across the country each day, fire 
threatens our communities, our livelihoods, and our lives. Last year 
alone, almost 5,000 men, women, and children perished in fires, and 
nearly 80 percent of these deaths occurred in homes. This tragic 
statistic is a call to action for all of us, not only to remain vigilant 
in our efforts to prevent fires, but also to learn how to react quickly 
and sensibly when fires occur.
Many people do not understand the speed at which fire can spread, the 
intensity of its heat, or the toxic power of its smoke. Because a quick, 
decisive response often means the difference between life and death, it 
is important to learn about fire, to recognize how deadly a threat it 
is, and to react to it immediately. The National Fire Protection 
Association, in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
and our Nation's fire services, has selected ``Know When to Go! React 
Fast To Fire!'' as the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week. This 
theme reinforces a simple but essential element of fire safety: escape 
planning.
Because approximately 80 percent of last year's fatal fires occurred in 
the home, every family should develop a home escape plan. If a smoke or 
fire alarm sounds, everyone must react quickly. When away from home, we 
need to make it a habit to locate the nearest exit in any building we 
occupy. Most important, we must never reenter a burning building.
By following these basic safety rules, we can save lives and reduce the 
risks to our Nation's firefighters. Every 16 seconds, a fire department 
responds to a fire somewhere in the United States. Last year, thousands 
of firefighters were injured, and 92 made the ultimate sacrifice in the 
line of duty. Our Nation will acknowledge the extraordinary dedication 
of these valiant men and women by paying tribute to America's career and 
volunteer firefighters on Sunday, October 5, 1997, at the National 
Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service in Emmitsburg, Maryland.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitu-

[[Page 153]]
tion and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 5 through October 
11, 1997, as Fire Prevention Week. I encourage the people of the United 
States to take an active role in fire prevention not only during this 
week, but throughout the year. I also call upon all Americans to honor 
the courageous members of our Nation's fire and emergency services by 
learning about the dangers posed by fire and by preparing their friends 
and family members to react immediately and safely to fires when they 
occur.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7033 of October 6, 1997

Child Health Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

For children, childhood seems to last forever; but for adults--
particularly for those of us who are parents--it passes in the blink of 
an eye. The little girl smiling at us from her tricycle and the little 
boy running to catch the school bus will soon be driving away to their 
first jobs. One of the greatest gifts we can offer our children while 
they are still in our care is a healthy start in life.
We are making tremendous progress as a nation in helping more children 
get that healthy start. This year I signed into law historic legislation 
to extend health care coverage to millions of uninsured children. This 
$24 billion initiative over 5 years is the largest investment in 
children's health since the creation of Medicaid in 1965. On October 1, 
the Federal Government and the States began a partnership to help 
provide meaningful health insurance to children whose families earn too 
much for Medicaid but too little to afford private coverage.
This new initiative will take an enormous step toward improving the 
health of our Nation's children. In 1995, approximately 10 million of 
them were not covered by health insurance, and they were either 
ineligible for or not enrolled in publicly financed medical assistance 
programs. Last year, another 800,000 uninsured children joined their 
ranks. These children are less likely to receive the primary care 
services they need to maintain good health, and they are at risk of 
receiving lower quality care. Too often they become trapped in a tragic 
downward spiral--poor health keeps them out of school, keeps them from 
pursuing their studies with energy and enthusiasm, and often keeps them 
from acquiring the knowledge and self-esteem they need to reach their 
full potential. With this new children's health initiative, we can 
provide millions of children the coverage they need to grow up healthy 
and strong.
We are making progress in other areas, as well. Thanks to advances in 
medical research and our increasing knowledge about prevention and the 
im-

[[Page 154]]
portance of good nutrition, many childhood diseases and illnesses can 
now be averted. Funding for childhood immunization has doubled since 
1993, and immunization rates are at an all-time high. In addition, we 
recently announced an important Food and Drug Administration regulation 
requiring manufacturers to do studies on pediatric populations for new 
prescription drugs--and those currently on the market--to ensure that 
our prescription drugs have been adequately tested for the unique needs 
of children. We have dramatically increased participation in the Women, 
Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program, providing nutrition 
packages and information and health referrals to more than 7 million 
infants, children, and pregnant women. With the enactment of the 
Kassebaum-Kennedy bill last year, we have helped millions of children 
keep their healthcare coverage when their parents change or lose jobs.
We are also taking strong actions to prevent our children from smoking. 
Each day 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1,000 of them will 
die from a tobacco-related illness. Last year, my Administration issued 
guide-lines to eliminate easy access to tobacco products and to prohibit 
companies from directing advertising towards children.
To acknowledge our profound responsibility to nurture the health and 
development of America's children, the Congress, by joint resolution 
approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), has called for the 
designation of the first Monday in October as ``Child Health Day'' and 
has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of 
this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 6, 1997, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon my fellow Americans to join me on that day, and every 
day throughout the year, in strengthening our national commitment to the 
well-being of our children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7034 of October 6, 1997

German-American Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

America has always drawn its strength from the millions of people who 
have come here in search of freedom and the opportunity to live out 
their dreams. Men and women of different nationalities, different races, 
and different religions have made their own rich and unique 
contributions to our national life.
From their arrival at Jamestown in 1607 until the present day, Germans 
have been among the largest ethnic groups to make their home in our 
country. Like so many others, the earliest German settlements in America 
were

[[Page 155]]
founded by men and women in search of religious liberty. William 
Penn invited a group of German Mennonites to Pennsylvania, which was to 
remain a center of German settlement during the Colonial period. Other 
German communities were founded in New Jersey and New York, as well as 
in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, the Carolinas, and Georgia. In the 19th 
century, German pioneers began to settle in the Midwest and West, and 
today a quarter of our Nation's population can trace its ancestry to 
German origins.
Germans and German Americans have profoundly influenced every facet of 
American life. Great soldiers, such as General Baron von Steuben in our 
Revolutionary War and General Norman Schwarzkopf in the Gulf War, have 
fought to preserve our freedom and defend America's interests. 
Scientists such as Albert Einstein and Wernher von Braun have 
immeasurably broadened our horizons, as have artists like Albert 
Bierstadt, Josef Albers, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Lillian Blauvelt, and 
Paul Hindemith. And generations of German Americans, with their energy, 
creativity, and strong work ethic, have enriched the economic and 
commercial life of the United States. All Americans have benefited 
greatly from the labor, leadership, talents, and vision of Germans and 
German Americans, and it is fitting that we set aside this special day 
to acknowledge their many contributions to our liberty, culture, and 
democracy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 6, 1997, 
as German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize and 
celebrate the many gifts that millions of people of German ancestry have 
brought to our national life.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7035 of October 9, 1997

 Leif Erikson Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Americans have always been a people marked by a spirit of discovery. 
Generations of American explorers and pioneers have pushed against the 
boundaries of the known world, eager to see what lies beyond the next 
horizon. We come by that spirit naturally, for millions of us are 
descended from men and women of courage, vision, and independence who 
left their native lands to seek new possibilities in a new world.
One of the earliest of these was Leif Erikson. Almost a thousand years 
ago, braving the cold and unforgiving North Atlantic, he set out on a 
voyage that would ultimately bring him to this continent and a lasting 
place in his-

[[Page 156]]
tory. But Leif Erikson is more than a symbol of the pioneer 
spirit. He is also a powerful reminder of the long and proud history of 
the sons and daughters of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland 
who endured the hardships of the American frontier to build a new life 
for themselves and their families. These immigrants from the Nordic 
countries, and their descendants, have contributed immeasurably to 
America's strength, character, prosperity, and independent spirit.
Today, the people of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland are 
our partners in building a new Europe. Committed to democracy and self-
determination, they have always reached out to those struggling for 
freedom and equality. We are proud to join them in fostering the 
integration of the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
into the Western family of nations. We also look forward to joining our 
Nordic friends in celebrating in the year 2000 the millennial 
anniversary of Leif Erikson's momentous voyage to our shores. It is 
fitting that we should pay special tribute to Leif Erikson--son of 
Iceland, grandson of Norway--as we begin our own uncharted journey of 
discovery into the new millennium that stretches before us.
In honor of Leif Erikson and of our Nordic-American heritage, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved on September 2, 1964 (Public Law 
88-566), has authorized and requested the President to proclaim October 
9 of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 1997, as Leif Erikson Day. I 
encourage the people of the United States to observe this occasion with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities commemorating our rich Nordic-
American heritage.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7036 of October 9, 1997

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

In times of peace and at moments of great crisis, America has been 
blessed with the steadfast support of friends from other nations. Few 
have proved their friendship with more courage and generosity than 
Casimir Pulaski, who paid for America's independence with his own life.
As a son of Poland, Pulaski knew well the desire for freedom and self-
determination. He fought bravely beside his father and brothers in his 
native land, defending Poland from the aggression of neighboring empires 
with such skill and valor that he was known throughout Europe for his 
military exploits. Ultimately outnumbered by opposing forces, he escaped 
to


[[Page 157]]
France, where he met Benjamin Franklin and offered his services in 
behalf of the American Revolution.
Upon his arrival in America, Pulaski told General Washington that he had 
come to defend liberty and ``to live or die for her.'' True to his word, 
he fought valiantly as a brigadier general in our Continental Army and 
made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation's freedom during the siege of 
Savannah.
More than two centuries later, Americans and Poles alike remember with 
pride and gratitude the outstanding service General Pulaski gave to both 
his native and adopted lands. Today the United States and Poland enjoy 
freedom, prosperity, and the prospect for a bright future as allies in 
NATO, thanks to the unwavering commitment of patriots and heroes like 
Casimir Pulaski.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Saturday, October 11, 
1997, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to 
commemorate this occasion with appropriate programs and activities 
paying tribute to Casimir Pulaski and his contributions to the cause of 
American freedom.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7037 of October 10, 1997

White Cane Safety Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

As we stand at the dawn of the 21st century, new technologies are 
rapidly changing and improving the lives of Americans. For one group of 
Americans in particular--those who are blind or visually impaired--these 
technologies have opened doors to unparalleled opportunities. Blind 
Americans now can more readily access information of all kinds, and 
these advances have brought important improvements to the education, 
careers, and daily lives of blind and visually impaired people.
In this time of extraordinary progress, however, the simple yet 
profoundly useful white cane remains an indispensable tool and symbol of 
independence that has afforded countless blind and visually impaired 
citizens the opportunity to pursue the American Dream. And so, as we all 
share in a new era of expanded technological innovations that improve 
the lives of all of our Nation's citizens, we also celebrate the white 
cane for its ability to empower and recognize it as the embodiment of 
freedom.
As a Nation, let us also reassert our commitment to ensuring equal 
opportunity, equal access, and full participation of citizens with 
disabilities in


[[Page 158]]
our community life. This year, we celebrated the 
reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 
reaffirming our belief that all students can learn and must have the 
opportunities and resources necessary to do so. And we must continue to 
enforce vigorously the Americans with Disabilities Act, so that our 
blind and visually impaired fellow citizens enjoy equal opportunity, 
access to public and private services and accommodations, and a 
workplace free of discrimination.
To honor the numerous achievements of blind and visually impaired 
citizens and to recognize the significance of the white cane in 
advancing independence, the Congress, by joint resolution approved 
October 6, 1964, has designated October 15 of each year as ``White Cane 
Safety Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1997, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon the people of the United States, government officials, 
educators, and business leaders to observe this day with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7038 of October 10, 1997

National School Lunch Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Each year during the month of October, we set aside a week to focus on 
the importance of the National School Lunch Program and its 
contributions to the health and well-being of America's schoolchildren. 
Through this program, established more than 50 years ago by President 
Truman, young people learn firsthand about healthful dietary habits and 
how to make wise choices regarding the foods they eat. And for millions 
of children, many of whom come from families in need, their school lunch 
is the most nutritious meal they will eat during the day.
When President Kennedy proclaimed the first National School Lunch Week 
in 1963, some 68,000 schools were serving lunches to 16 million children 
each day. Today, the program is available in more than 94,000 schools 
across the country, and 26 million students participate daily. This 
dramatic growth proves that the program continues to meet a significant 
need in local communities across the Nation, and its success admirably 
reflects the hard work and commitment of school food-service 
professionals, as well as the support and technical assistance provided 
by State administrators.
The National School Lunch Program also reflects our profound concern for 
the well-being of our young people. By providing them with wholesome, 
nutritious meals day in and day out, we are helping to improve our 
children's overall health, increase their learning capacity, lengthen 
their atten-

[[Page 159]]
tion span, and promote healthful dietary habits that will 
serve them well for a lifetime.
All of these accomplishments are made possible by the many dedicated 
food-service professionals, administrators, educators, parents, business 
and community leaders, and other concerned individuals at the local, 
State, and Federal levels who work in partnership to ensure the 
effectiveness of the National School Lunch Program. We must strive to 
build on their achievements so that this vital program will continue to 
meet the needs of America's children into the next century.
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch Program 
to the nutritional well-being of children, the Congress by joint 
resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law No. 87-780), has designated 
the week beginning the second Sunday in October of each year as 
``National School Lunch Week'' and has requested the President to issue 
a proclamation in observance of that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 12 through October 18, 1997, as 
National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize those 
individuals whose efforts contribute to the success of this program and 
to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7039 of October 10, 1997

Columbus Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

The life and achievements of Christopher Columbus demonstrate how 
powerful and lasting an influence one individual can have on the course 
of human history. Although great explorers reached the shores of this 
continent both before and after Columbus, few have captured the American 
imagination as he has. Perhaps because we have always been an 
adventurous people, eager for challenge and change, we feel a special 
affinity for this extraordinary man who left the safety of known waters 
to pursue his vision across the ocean to the threshold of a new world.
Although his momentous voyages across the Atlantic took place more than 
500 years ago, their impact can still be felt today. Columbus' 
discoveries in the West Indies brought about substantive and continuing 
contact between the peoples of the Old World and the New, contact that 
gave rise to misunderstandings and conflicts that we still seek to 
reconcile today. He also made possible the exploration and settlement of 
North America and opened the door to our continent for generations to 
follow--people of every race and culture and ethnic origin, who have 
given our Nation its rich and

[[Page 160]]
unique diversity. Christopher Columbus, a 
son of Italy whose bold enterprise was made possible by the Spanish 
crown, holds a special place in the hearts of Americans of Italian and 
Spanish heritage. But, as we prepare for our own voyage of discovery 
into the next millennium, all Americans can draw inspiration from the 
character and accomplishments of Columbus. With vision, courage, 
imagination, and optimism, we can create a future bright with promise 
and a new world where all of us can pursue our dreams.
In recognition of the enduring achievements of Christopher Columbus, the 
Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), and an 
Act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250), has requested the President to 
proclaim the second Monday in October of each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 13, 1997, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7040 of October 10, 1997

National Children's Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

With the birth of every child, the world becomes new again. Within each 
new infant lies enormous potential--potential for loving, for learning, 
and for making life better for others. But this potential must be 
nurtured. Just as seeds need fertile soil, warm sunshine, and gentle 
rain to grow, so do our children need a caring environment, the security 
of knowing they are loved, and the encouragement and opportunity to make 
the most of their God-given talents. There is no more urgent task before 
us, as a people and as a Nation, than creating such an environment for 
America's children.
One of the surest ways to do so is to strengthen American families and 
help parents in their efforts to raise healthy, happy children. My 
Administration has worked hard to give parents the tools they need to 
fulfill their crucial responsibilities. We have sought to put tobacco 
and guns out of the reach of children. We are improving the quality of 
our children's schools by making a national commitment to high academic 
and teaching standards. Recognizing the importance of a child's early 
years to his or her development, we have expanded Head Start and 
established Early Head Start for low-income families with children 3 
years old or younger. We have made it easier for millions of parents to 
take time off to be with a sick child

[[Page 161]]
without losing their jobs, and to 
keep their health insurance when they change jobs. We have protected 
Medicaid coverage for 36 million Americans, including about 20 million 
children, and the Balanced Budget Act I recently signed into law will 
provide meaningful health care coverage to millions more uninsured 
children.
But there is still much to be accomplished if we are to ensure that 
America's children grow up to meet their fullest potential. Our next 
important goal must be to build upon our efforts and improve the quality 
and affordability of child care in our Nation. With more people in the 
work force, with more single-parent homes, and with more families in 
which both parents have to work to make ends meet, millions of American 
children are already in some form of day care, and the demand for 
affordable, quality child care is growing. Later this month, the First 
Lady and I will host the White House Conference on Child Care to work 
with and learn from other parents, child care providers and experts, 
business leaders, and economists. Together we will focus on the best 
means to increase the quality, availability, and affordability of child 
care in our Nation.
As we observe National Children's Day this year, let us recommit 
ourselves to creating a society where parents can raise healthy, happy 
children; where every newborn is cherished, where every child is 
encouraged to succeed, and where all our young people are free to pursue 
their dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 12, 1997, as 
National Children's Day. I urge all Americans to express their love and 
appreciation for children on this day and on every day throughout the 
year. I invite Federal officials, State and local governments, and 
particularly all American families to join together in observing this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's 
children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7041 of October 15, 1997

International Rural Women's Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Our world has been continually uplifted and renewed by the contributions 
of women. Women of courage and conscience, women of strength and 
compassion, women of vision and talent have enriched every aspect of 
international society. In our own Nation, the names of such 
extraordinary individuals as Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, Jane 
Addams, Rosa Parks, Dolores Huerta, and so many more, are etched on our 
history and in our hearts. But there are millions of other women who 
live and work among

[[Page 162]]
us whose names will never be known, but whose 
efforts and energy contribute profoundly to the quality of our lives. 
Rural women are numbered among these many quiet heroes.
Today rural women comprise more than one-quarter of the world's 
population, and they form the basis of much of the world's agricultural 
economy. In the United States, working on farms and ranches, they play a 
vital part in ensuring a healthy, safe, and abundant supply of food and 
fiber for our people. In developing countries, as small farmers, 
laborers, and entrepreneurs, rural women help produce most of the food, 
create many of the jobs, and manage most of their countries' natural 
resources. While millions of rural women worldwide live below the 
poverty level, struggling to survive with scarce resources and little 
training and education, they still manage to feed their families and 
contribute to their communities.
When the international community came together in Beijing in 1995 for 
the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women, rural women made 
their voices heard by world leaders, and their hard work and sacrifice 
were at last recognized by people across the globe. Next year, when the 
United States hosts the Second World Conference on Women in Agriculture, 
we will continue to focus on the status of rural women and their 
contributions to our world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1997, as 
International Rural Women's Day in the United States. I call upon the 
American people to observe this day with appropriate programs and 
activities in recognition of the extraordinary contributions rural women 
make to the quality of our lives, both in America and around the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7042 of October 17, 1997

National Forest Products Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

America's forests are a precious resource, making numerous rich 
contributions not only to the natural splendor of our Nation, but also 
to the well-being of our people. Whether part of the vast acreages that 
make up our industrial, State, and National forests or rural woodlots 
and urban forests, they offer us clean water and air, priceless wildlife 
habitat and fisheries, welcome settings for recreation, and breathtaking 
beauty. Our forests also provide us with more tangible products 
essential to everyday living: wood and paper products for our homes, 
schools, and offices, and even medicines and food.


[[Page 163]]
While the wood products we harvest from our forests can be so durable 
that they last for centuries, forest ecosystems themselves are very 
fragile. America's growing population and urban expansion are putting 
ever-increasing demands on forest lands and resources. We must work 
together to devise imaginative forest management approaches that will 
allow us to preserve and cultivate healthy forest ecosystems, meet the 
need for forest products, provide jobs for those who depend on forests 
for their livelihood, and continue to offer Americans enjoyable 
recreational opportunities.
Fortunately, forest research is equipping us with vital knowledge that 
can help us to balance the many and varied demands on our woodlands. 
Thanks to such research, we are now using new products and innovative 
technologies and employing new recycling methods that not only extend 
the available supply of raw materials, but also help us to process those 
materials more efficiently and with fewer harmful by-products. This use 
of science to balance the needs of our people both for forest products 
and a healthy environment will help us to achieve our goal of 
sustainable forest management.
All of us are indebted to past generations of Americans whose vision and 
generosity preserved so many of our Nation's great forests for our use 
and pleasure. Now it falls to us to continue their wise stewardship so 
that we may pass on to future generations this priceless natural legacy.
In recognition of the central role our forests play in the long-term 
welfare of our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 
163), has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October 
of each year as ``National Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 19 through October 25, 1997, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 7043 of October 17, 1997

National Character Counts Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

The roots of America's greatness are embedded in the character of its 
citizens. From our Founders' passion for justice and equality to the 
social consciousness and humanitarian spirit of today's citizens, the 
character of our people has inspired the world. Undeniably, character 
does count for our citizens, our communities, and our Nation, and this 
week we celebrate the


[[Page 164]]
importance of character in our individual lives 
and in the life of our country.
Instilling sound character in our children is essential to maintaining 
the strength of our Nation into the 21st century. The core ethical 
values of trustworthiness, fairness, responsibility, caring, respect, 
and citizenship form the foundation of our democracy, our economy, and 
our society. These qualities are not innate but learned, and we must 
ensure that we nurture them--both through our words and our example--in 
our Nation's young people.
More than any other institution, the family is the cradle of character, 
giving children their first crucial lessons in attitude and behavior. In 
today's complex society, where children are subject to pressures and 
negative influences rarely experienced by earlier generations, parents 
face great challenges as they strive to impart to their children the 
values that will help them become caring and responsible members of 
society.
My Administration has worked hard to give parents new tools to help them 
fulfill their important responsibilities. We worked to require V-chips 
on all new televisions to give parents greater control over what their 
children watch; we collaborated with the television industry to 
encourage the airing of more educational programming for children; and 
we negotiated a breakthrough agreement with the entertainment and 
broadcast industries to create a voluntary ratings system that will help 
parents identify programs containing material inappropriate for 
children. Our proposed funding for the Anti-Gang and Youth Violence 
Strategy will provide for after-school initiatives in communities across 
the country to help keep young people occupied in wholesome activities, 
off the streets, and out of trouble while their parents are at work.
Schools also have an important role in educating our young people about 
the difference between right and wrong. My Administration has recognized 
this by creating partnerships with the States to help our schools do a 
better job of teaching character to America's students. Our push for 
rigorous standards and our promise to open the doors of college to all 
students who work hard let students know that good character really does 
count and will be rewarded with expanded opportunity. We also should 
encourage and commend the schools across our country that have begun to 
incorporate volunteer service as a curriculum requirement, teaching 
students the important life lessons of sharing, compassion, and civic 
responsibility.
Developing strong values in America's children requires the 
participation of all our people. As we observe this special week, I ask 
that all Americans demonstrate in their personal and public lives, and 
teach actively to our country's children, the high ethical standards 
that are essential to good character and to the continued success of our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 19 through October 
25, 1997, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon the people of 
the United States, government officials, educators, religious, 
community, and business leaders, and the States to commemorate this week 
with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation 7044 of October 23, 1997

United Nations Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

In April of 1945, representatives of 50 nations gathered in San 
Francisco for the United Nations Conference on International 
Organization. The leaders assembled for that historic meeting were not 
idle dreamers. They were experienced statesmen and hard realists, 
horrified by the staggering destruction and human misery wrought by two 
world wars, and convinced that the conduct of international affairs must 
change. The United Nations Charter that emerged from their deliberations 
was a document both wise and hopeful--wise in its recognition that 
lasting peace comes only with respect for the dignity and value of every 
human being, and hopeful in its determination to protect future 
generations from the affliction of war.
As with all human enterprises, the United Nations has had its share of 
failure and success in the 5 decades since its Charter was ratified. But 
no one can dispute that the U.N. has worked to make the world a better 
place. Human suffering knows no borders, and men and women of goodwill 
from nations across the globe have dedicated their skills and energy to 
U.N. programs committed to relieving such suffering. For half a century, 
the organizations and programs of the United Nations have fought hunger 
and disease, defended human rights, provided disaster relief, taught 
sustainable development, and cared for refugees.
The United Nations has also fulfilled its mission as a force for peace 
in the world. For 50 years, it has helped to avert another world war and 
prevent nuclear holocaust. Today, it continues working to keep nations 
like El Salvador, Haiti, Cyprus, and Bosnia from further bloodshed. It 
serves as a voice for the international community in defining acceptable 
behavior and punishing those states that ignore the most basic global 
norms of conduct. And the United Nations has become a vital 
international crossroads, where men and women of every race, culture, 
religion, and ethnic background can come together to share their common 
hopes and dreams.
The leaders who gathered in San Francisco so many years ago would 
scarcely recognize our world today. For the first time in history, more 
than half the world's people freely choose their own governments. Free 
markets are expanding, bringing with them exciting opportunities for 
growth and prosperity. The satellite and the microchip have 
revolutionized human communication, changing forever the way we live and 
work and interact. In this new global community, the U.N. mission is as 
important as it was in the waning days of World War II--pursuing peace 
and security, promot-

[[Page 166]]
ing human rights, and striving to help move people 
from poverty to prosperity.
We in the United States must continue our efforts to help the United 
Nations rise to the challenges of our time. Thanks to an ongoing reform 
process, we have seen substantial improvements in management, 
administrative accountability, and the setting of priorities by the U.N. 
This progress has set the stage for broader efforts to ensure that the 
United Nations is fully prepared to continue to pursue the goals laid 
down in its Charter.
As we observe United Nations Day this year, let us remember all those 
whose foresight and determination created this great international 
institution, and let us thank all those who, with courage and 
conviction, continue to fulfill its vital missions.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, October 24, 1997, 
as United Nations Day. I encourage all Americans to acquaint themselves 
with the activities and accomplishments of the United Nations, and to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities 
furthering the goal of international cooperation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7045 of October 24, 1997

National Consumers Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Americans have always had a passion for fairness. It imbues the great 
charters on which our Nation is founded, and it is the cornerstone of 
our legal system. Fairness must also form the foundation of the American 
economy, an economy in which consumers rightly expect a ``fair shake'': 
honest transactions and safe, dependable goods and services.
Our economy has changed enormously during the past 200 years, developing 
from the agrarian system of the 18th century through the Industrial 
Revolution of the 19th century to the information revolution of our own 
era. Today, technological innovation is rapidly transforming our 
relationships with the marketplace and the goods and services we buy. 
However, despite these dramatic changes, basic consumer values remain 
the same. Consumers still expect quality and service for their money; 
they still place great importance on the safety and reliability of the 
products they buy; and they still want to know that businesses will meet 
these expectations.
In the days of Adam Smith, when products were less complicated and their 
quality more easily discerned, caveat emptor was the ruling principle of


[[Page 167]]
the marketplace. In today's economy, where the microchip has 
dramatically altered what we buy and how and where we buy it, products 
and services are much more complex, and consumers need better 
information and greater protection to ensure that the marketplace 
continues to treat them fairly.
The Consumer Bill of Rights, first articulated in President Kennedy's 
1962 Special Message to Congress on Protecting the Consumer Interest, 
has evolved with our economy to meet the changing needs of the American 
people. Consumers today have the right to safety, the right to 
information, the right to choice, the right to be heard, the right to 
consumer education, and the right to service. They also deserve security 
for any personal information provided during the conduct of a 
transaction, whether in person or on the Internet. As we observe 
National Consumer Week, I urge the American people to learn more about 
their rights as responsible consumers and to reward those businesses 
that continue to give them a fair shake.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 25 through October 
31, 1997, as National Consumers Week. I call upon government officials, 
industry leaders, and the American people to recognize the vital 
relationship between our economy and our citizenry, and to join me in 
reaffirming our commitment to fairness in the marketplace.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.

Proclamation 7046 of October 30, 1997

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

As we approach this century's end, many of the blocs and barriers that 
divided the world for 50 years largely have fallen away. All around the 
world, with America's help, nations are moving from conflict to 
cooperation. However, we still face challenges that have taken on new 
and dangerous dimensions: ethnic and religious violence, aggression by 
outlaw states, the illegal drug trade, and threats from international 
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The National Guard and 
Reserve play a vital role in the response of America's Armed Forces to 
this broad spectrum of challenges to our national security, and they are 
an indispensable part of the effort to promote peace and democratic 
values.
While most Americans understand and deeply appreciate the strategic and 
military value of our National Guard and Reserve forces, too often we 
fail to recognize or acknowledge the important contributions of their 
civilian employers. When called upon to share their greatest resource--
employees


[[Page 168]]
serving as citizen-soldiers--these employers subordinate their 
own interests for the good of our country, even when they may incur 
financial hardship and organizational disruption. It is only because of 
the willingness by employers to place our Nation's well-being above 
their own that our National Guard and Reserve are able to provide 
mission-ready and accessible forces to help preserve our freedom and 
protect our national interests. The generosity of these employers is key 
to enabling Reserve components to play an ever greater and more diverse 
role in our country's Armed Forces. By setting aside this special time 
to honor the sacrifice of our Nation's employers, we express our 
heartfelt appreciation to these patriots for employing our citizen-
soldiers, making it possible for them to serve, and helping to keep 
America strong, secure, and free.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2 through 
November 8, 1997, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve 
Week. I encourage all Americans to join me in expressing our heartfelt 
thanks to the civilian employers of the members of our National Guard 
and Reserve for their extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our Nation. 
I also call upon State and local officials, private organizations, 
businesses, and all military commanders to observe this week with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7047 of November 1, 1997

National American Indian Heritage Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

American Indians and Alaska Natives have played a vital role in the life 
of our country, and their many contributions have enhanced the freedom, 
prosperity, and greatness of America today. In celebrating National 
American Indian Heritage Month, we reaffirm our country's commitment to 
remember those contributions and to honor the unique heritage of our 
continent's first inhabitants.
This special observance also reflects our continuing commitment to 
American Indian and Alaska Native tribal governments as an integral part 
of the social, political, and economic fabric of the United States. The 
framers of our Constitution incorporated Indian nations into the 
political and legal framework of this country, forever joining the 
destiny of the tribal nations with that of the American people. By this 
action, our founders charged themselves and future generations with the 
moral obligation to guard the rights and fundamental liberties of our 
country's tribal peoples as zealously as we protect the rights of all 
Americans.



[[Page 169]]
As we enter the next millennium, we have an exciting opportunity to open 
a new era of understanding, cooperation, and respect among all of 
America's people. We must work together to tear down the walls of 
separation and mistrust and build a strong foundation for the future. To 
accomplish this, we must strengthen tribal governments, improve the 
quality of education for American Indian and Alaska Native youth, build 
stable, diversified economies in tribal communities, create high-wage 
jobs, and ensure that all our citizens have the skills, education, and 
opportunities they need to reach their full potential.
The government-to-government relationship between the tribes and the 
United States embodies the fundamental American belief that people of 
widely varied and diverse cultural backgrounds can join together to 
build a great country. Such greatness can be sustained, however, only so 
long as we honor the ideals and principles upon which America is founded 
and abide by our commitments to all our people. In recognition of 
America's moral and legal obligations to American Indians and Alaska 
Natives, and in light of the special trust relationship between tribal 
governments and the Government of the United States, we celebrate 
National American Indian Heritage Month.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1997 as National 
American Indian Heritage Month. I urge all Americans, as well as their 
elected representatives at the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels, 
to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7048 of November 3, 1997

National Adoption Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Most American children are blessed with loving, stable families. But, 
tragically, in our country today there are too many children whose 
parents are unwilling or unable to care for them. While foster care 
offers these children a safe and nurturing temporary haven in their time 
of greatest need, as many as 100,000 foster care kids will need 
permanent homes in the next few years. Many of these children have 
special needs and require the security and stability of an adoptive 
family to develop their full potential. Adoption allows these and other 
children to have the permanent homes they deserve, and it enables many 
dedicated adults to experience the joys and rewards of parenting.

[[Page 170]]
My Administration is working hard to find ways to help encourage 
adoption. On December 14, 1996, I issued a Memorandum to the Secretaries 
of Health and Human Services, the Treasury, Labor, and Commerce and to 
the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, directing them to 
promote efforts to both increase the number of children who are adopted 
or permanently placed each year and to move children more rapidly from 
foster care to permanent homes. I also urged them to increase public 
awareness about the children waiting for permanent families and to 
encourage all Americans to consider the rewards of adoption.
I challenged the members of my Administration to work with States, 
communities, and civic leaders to create a plan for doubling the number 
of adoptions and permanent placements for children to 54,000 by the year 
2002. And on February 14, 1997, the Adoption 2002 report, outlining 
changes in policies and practices necessary to reach this goal, was 
released. Since then, we have been actively implementing the 
recommendations included in the report, and States are reviewing data 
and submitting numerical targets for adoption and guardianships to be 
completed by the year 2002. The Office of Personnel Management has 
published a guide for Federal workers interested in adopting, and the 
Department of Health and Human Services is preparing to make the first 
annual Adoption 2002 Excellence awards later this year. Finally, the 
Congress is considering historic legislation that would provide the 
resources and statutory authority for financial incentives, technical 
assistance, and improved judicial decision-making for children in foster 
care.
As a Nation, we have before us an opportunity to make a real difference 
in the lives of our most vulnerable children. We must continue to 
promote public awareness of the need for adoptive families and to help 
families make the choice to provide loving, permanent homes for the many 
children who otherwise must continue to wait. We must also strengthen 
our support of those families who do choose to adopt. As we observe 
National Adoption Month, we reaffirm our commitment to adoption as a new 
beginning for thousands of children, and we celebrate the many American 
families who have embraced these children by accepting the rewards and 
responsibilities of adoption.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1997 as National 
Adoption Month. I urge all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities to honor adoptive families and to 
participate in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7049 of November 6, 1997

National Day of Concern About Young People and Gun Violence, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

On this day in America, as on every other day, children will die by 
gunfire, and many of them will be killed because other children are 
pulling the trigger. This is a stark and sad reality and a call to each 
of us, not only to raise public awareness of a national tragedy, but 
also to do everything within our power to end the killing.
There is some encouraging news. The Department of Justice recently 
reported that violent crime among youths dropped by more than 9 percent 
in 1996. However, we still have a long way to go in our efforts to save 
lives and help ensure a brighter future for our children.
One of my Administration's highest law enforcement priorities is to 
protect our children from violent crime, and we are especially concerned 
with stopping crimes committed by young people. I am pleased that eight 
of the Nation's largest gun manufacturers have responded to my 
Administration's call to provide child safety lock devices with every 
handgun they sell. We proposed a $60 million increase for the Safe and 
Drug-Free Schools Program this year, which reaches almost all of our 
Nation's school districts. These funds will help communities protect 
students from violence. My Administration also proposed funding for 
after-school initiatives in communities across the country to give our 
young people something positive to say yes to, to keep them off the 
streets, and to keep them out of trouble. Through our Anti-Gang and 
Youth Violence Strategy, we are working to provide for more prosecutors 
and probation officers, tougher penalties, and better gang prevention 
efforts.
But government alone cannot guarantee our children will grow up free 
from violence and fear. Parents, teachers, religious and community 
leaders, businesses, youth organizations, and especially young people 
themselves have a vital part to play. Parents and other adults must set 
a good example for the children in their care and teach them right from 
wrong. Adults who own a gun have a responsibility to keep that weapon 
out of the hands of our youth. Communities must unite to keep schools 
safe and to provide young people with positive, fulfilling activities 
after school and during summers and holidays. Most important, young 
people themselves have a duty to learn that violence solves nothing; to 
act responsibly when confronted by peer pressure by relying on their own 
good judgment, and to encourage their friends and classmates to resolve 
conflicts peacefully.
I am heartened by the knowledge that hundreds of thousands of young 
Americans across the country will have an opportunity on this National 
Day of Concern to sign the Student Pledge Against Gun Violence. By 
making this earnest promise never to take a gun to school, never to use 
a gun to settle a dispute, and to use their influence to keep their 
friends from using guns, these young people will take a giant step 
toward a brighter, safer future.


[[Page 172]]
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 6, 1997, as a 
National Day of Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. On this 
day, I call upon young Americans in classrooms and communities across 
the country to make a solemn decision about their future by signing the 
Student Pledge Against Gun Violence. I further urge all Americans to 
help our Nation's young people avoid violence and grow up to be healthy, 
happy, productive adults.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7050 of November 7, 1997

Veterans Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Americans have always looked to the future. Planning for next week, next 
month, or next year, we rarely dwell on the past, but rather look ahead 
to tomorrow. But each year in November, we pause to look back, to 
reflect with pride and profound gratitude on the achievements of our 
Nation's veterans. The service and sacrifice of these millions of 
courageous men and women is a gleaming thread that weaves, unbroken, 
through the fabric of American history.
More than two centuries ago, the framers of our Constitution outlined in 
a few brief words the burden and privilege that generations of American 
veterans would willingly embrace: to ``provide for the common defence . 
. . and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity . 
. . .'' Since the days of the American Revolution, nearly 42 million 
patriots have taken up arms to defend America and to guarantee that the 
blessings of liberty are, indeed, secure. From Lexington and Concord to 
Fort McHenry and San Juan Hill, from the Argonne Forest to the shores of 
Normandy, from the frozen terrain of Korea to the jungles of Vietnam and 
the sands of Kuwait, America's veterans have risked--and more than half 
a million have lost--their lives to preserve our freedom and defend our 
national interests.
Today, more than 25 million American veterans live among us. They come 
from every walk of life and from every ethnic, religious, and racial 
background. They are our family members, friends, and neighbors, but 
these seemingly ordinary citizens have accomplished extraordinary 
things. They have defended our liberty against every challenge, 
preserved our values, advanced democracy across the globe, and made 
America the world's best hope for freedom and lasting peace.
For these contributions, and for so much more, we owe our veterans an 
enormous debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay. To those who

[[Page 173]]
have completed their service and returned to civilian life, we owe the 
opportunity for a good education, a good job, and the chance to buy a 
home. For those who have suffered injury or illness in service to 
America, we must provide relief, quality health care, and the 
opportunity to live out their dreams. To the families of those still 
missing, we owe the fullest possible accounting and every effort to 
determine the fate of their loved ones. And to those who have died for 
us and for our country, whether here at home or on some foreign 
battlefield, we owe our lasting respect and the pledge to meet America's 
future challenges with the same valor and generosity that infused their 
sacrifice.
In recognition of and gratitude for the contributions of those who have 
served in our Armed Forces, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) 
that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public 
holiday to honor America's veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, November 11, 1997, as Veterans Day. 
I urge all Americans to acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of our 
veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers. I 
call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the 
United States and to encourage and participate in patriotic activities 
in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places 
of worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this 
national observance with suitable commemorative expressions and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7051 of November 20, 1997

National Great American Smokeout Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

For 21 years, this special day has been devoted to communicating a 
simple message: if you smoke, you need to quit--for life. Smoking is the 
largest cause of preventable death in this country, eventually killing 
one of every two people who continue to smoke. Every day, 3,000 
adolescents in America smoke their first cigarette, taking the first 
step to becoming regular smokers, and one-third of these new smokers 
will eventually die of tobacco-related diseases. Each of these 
devastating statistics represents a personal tragedy, needless 
suffering, and irreparable loss.
Because most smokers--more than 80 percent of them--begin smoking before 
their 18th birthday, my Administration is working hard to reach children 
before they decide to start. Last year, I announced tough measures to 
limit children's access to tobacco products and to reduce their appeal 
to young people. Now we are working with the Congress, the public health

[[Page 174]]
community, State attorneys general across the country, and other 
interested organizations to develop and pass comprehensive national 
legislation to reduce teen smoking significantly.
Such legislation must set ambitious targets to cut teen smoking rates 
and stiff financial penalties to help ensure that tobacco companies meet 
those targets. To counteract the pervasive influence of cigarette and 
smokeless tobacco advertising and promotion, we must mount a nationwide 
effort to strip tobacco of its allure, warning our young people of its 
addictive nature and deadly consequences and helping parents discourage 
their children from ever taking up the habit. The Food and Drug 
Administration must have full authority to see to it that industry 
develops less addictive, reduced-risk products. And we must strengthen 
and expand our current efforts to limit the advertising of tobacco to 
children and restrict young people's access to tobacco products.
The Great American Smokeout offers all Americans, smokers and nonsmokers 
alike, an invaluable opportunity to show our young people how much we 
care about them and how much their good health means to us. I urge the 
almost 48 million adult Americans and 4 million of our young people who 
still smoke to set an example of strength and determination by quitting 
for the day and, ultimately, for life. I encourage students across the 
Nation to participate in Smokeout activities designed to teach them 
about the dangers of smoking. I ask all Americans to renew their 
commitment to a smoke-free environment for themselves and for our 
children. If we can accomplish these goals today, we can do so every 
day, creating a better, healthier future for us all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20, 1997, as 
National Great American Smokeout Day. I call upon all Americans to join 
together in an effort to educate our children about the dangers of 
tobacco use, and I urge both smokers and nonsmokers to take this 
opportunity to begin healthier lifestyles that set a positive example 
for young people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7052 of November 21, 1997

Thanksgiving Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Another year has passed on our American journey. The seasons have 
completed another cycle, and it is harvest time in America. Once again, 
millions of us will gather with family and friends to give thanks to God 
for the many blessings that He has bestowed upon us.


[[Page 175]]
This Thanksgiving Day, as every day, we are grateful for the gift of 
freedom, for the vision made real by our Nation's founders and preserved 
by the courage, vigilance, and sacrifice of generations of Americans. We 
are thankful for the bounty and beauty of this great land, which has 
welcomed so many to its shores across the years. We cherish the love of 
our families and friends. We value the opportunity to provide for our 
children's future with the fruits of our honest labor. And, like the 
Pilgrims who celebrated Thanksgiving more than 300 years ago, we thank 
God for bringing us safely to the threshold of a new world, full of 
exhilarating challenge and promise.
In this new world, our children are growing up free from the shadows of 
the Cold War and the threat of nuclear holocaust. Nations once held 
captive by communism are learning the lessons of liberty and democracy. 
A revolution in technology has brought the world closer together and 
holds the prospect of greater knowledge and prosperity for people across 
the globe.
More than three centuries of change and growth separate us from the 
Pilgrims and their Native American friends who sat down together for 
their Thanksgiving meal. But the example and experience of those early 
Americans still hold great meaning for us today. They remind us that 
God's love strengthens and sustains us, both as individuals and as a 
Nation. They remind us that everyone has something to contribute, and 
that we are all richer when we learn to share. They teach us a simple 
but powerful lesson that each new generation of Americans must learn and 
pass on: we need one another. Like the Pilgrims, if we are to flourish 
in our new world, we must do so not as isolated individuals, but as 
members of a family, one America, sharing our gifts and leaving no one 
behind.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 27, 
1997, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all Americans to 
assemble in their homes, places of worship, or community centers to 
share the spirit of goodwill and prayer; to express heartfelt thanks to 
God for the many blessings He has bestowed upon us; and to reach out in 
true friendship to our brothers and sisters across this land who, 
together, comprise our great American family.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7053 of November 21, 1997

National Farm-City Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

When Americans sit down to a meal each day, we sometimes take for 
granted the quality and variety of the food we eat. Our grocery stores, 
su-

[[Page 176]]
permarkets, and restaurants offer us an enormous volume and selection 
of fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, and other food items, but 
we too often forget the hardworking men and women whose skill and effort 
put that food on our tables.
Strengthening our economy and providing food for people around the 
world, American agriculture is a leading global industry and a source of 
pride for our Nation. While producing an abundance of safe and 
affordable food and fiber, America's farmers and ranchers also provide a 
rich source of jobs in the United States. American agriculture employs 
more than 21 million people today, and agriculture-related industries 
continue to expand, pumping a trillion dollars into the American economy 
each year.
During the earliest days of our Nation, most of the crops farmers grew 
were used to feed their families or local consumers. Today, through 
advances in technology and marketing and through partnerships with 
agribusiness industries, research scientists, carriers, shippers, and 
retail distributors, America's farmers produce enough food and fiber to 
help meet the needs of people around the globe.
This week, as Americans gather with family and friends around the dinner 
table to give thanks for their many blessings, it is fitting that we 
count among those blessings the vital farm-city partnerships that have 
done so much to improve the quality of our lives. Rural and urban 
communities, working together to make the most of America's rich 
agricultural resources, continue to contribute immensely to the health 
and well-being of our people and to the vigor of our national economy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21 through 
November 27, 1997, as National Farm-City Week. I call upon citizens in 
urban and rural areas throughout the Nation to acknowledge and celebrate 
the achievements of all those who, working together, produce an 
abundance of agricultural products that strengthen and enrich our 
country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7054 of November 21, 1997

National Family Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

As we approach the end of the 21st century, our world is becoming 
increasingly complex, our society more mobile, and our pace of life more 
rapid. It is at times like this, full of dynamic challenge and change, 
that we need to remember the fundamental values and institutions

[[Page 177]]
that 
strengthen and uplift us. Among the most precious of these are our 
families.
Families come in many forms and sizes. They can number several 
generations or only one; they can include birth parents and stepparents, 
foster children and adopted children. Families are created by ties of 
blood or law, but they are sustained by ties of love and caring.
Few people in our lives will have so profound an effect on us as our 
family members. From the day we are born, the people who live with us, 
nurture us, and guide us play a crucial role in shaping the kind of men 
and women we become. They challenge us to look beyond ourselves and to 
respect and care for others. At their best, they help us to be our best. 
Families are the most basic--and the most important--unit of our 
society.
Recognizing this, we realize that many of our dreams for America begin 
with strong families. We want to be a caring people, and the lessons of 
tolerance, sharing, and compassion are best taught in the home. We want 
to be a peaceful people, and we look to families to teach our young 
people how to respect one another's differences and resolve disputes 
without resorting to violence. We want to be wise people, so we need 
families that value education and acknowledge the importance of lifelong 
learning.
Nothing is more important to our future than preserving and promoting 
strong, loving families. This week, as we gather with our own families 
to celebrate Thanksgiving, let us resolve to do all we can as 
individuals, and as a Nation to help families who are in need, to 
provide support and encouragement for troubled families, and to promote 
policies at the local, State, and Federal level that will help America's 
families to flourish.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 23 through 
November 29, 1997, as National Family Week. I call upon Federal, State, 
and local officials to honor American families with appropriate programs 
and activities; I encourage educators, community organizations, and 
religious leaders to celebrate the strength and values we draw from 
family relationships; and I urge all the people of the United States to 
reaffirm their family ties and to reach out to others in friendship and 
goodwill.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7055 of November 22, 1997

National Family Caregivers Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

During this season of thanksgiving, when we reflect on the many 
blessings that have been bestowed on us as individuals and as a Nation, 
we are espe-

[[Page 178]]
cially grateful for the love of our families and friends. One 
of the most profound ways in which that love is expressed is through the 
generous support provided by caregivers to those who need help if they 
are to remain in their homes and communities.
Caregivers reflect family and community life at its best. Thanks to 
their efforts, Americans with disabilities and a growing number of 
elderly Americans are able to stay in familiar surroundings and to 
maintain their dignity and independence. Caregivers not only enhance the 
quality of life for those they serve, but also greatly reduce the 
demands on the formal system of caregiving services in our Nation.
The statistics describing caregivers in America today tell an 
extraordinary story of generosity and compassion. Nearly one in four 
households is involved in caring for a relative or other loved one in 
need, providing a range of assistance from personal care to household 
help to transportation. Thirty percent of caregivers are caring for two 
or more people, and 64 percent hold down jobs while providing such care. 
Caregivers share not only their time, but also their resources, spending 
some $2 billion a month of their own assets for groceries, medicine, and 
other aid.
There is another side to caregiving in America today. Many older 
relatives now take care of children whose parents, for whatever reason, 
are no longer able to provide that care themselves. These generous men 
and women, who in many cases have already raised families and are 
looking forward to pursuing their own interests in retirement, embrace 
the challenges of parenting a new generation of young people. They give 
millions of our most vulnerable youth the opportunity to grow up in 
stable, loving homes.
These everyday heroes among us deserve our lasting gratitude and 
respect. This week, as we honor the many contributions that family 
caregivers make to the quality of our national life, let us resolve to 
work through our community, religious, social, business, and other 
organizations to offer programs and services that will provide 
caregivers the support and encouragement they need to carry out their 
vital responsibilities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 23 through 
November 29, 1997, as National Family Caregivers Week. I call upon 
Government officials, businesses, communities, educators, volunteers, 
and all the people of the United States to acknowledge the invaluable 
efforts of caregivers this week and throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7056 of December 1, 1997

World AIDS Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
oclamation

For more than 15 years, America and the world have faced the challenges 
posed by HIV and AIDS. This devastating disease respects no borders and 
does not discriminate. In every city, town, and community, we have lost 
sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, life 
partners and friends. HIV and AIDS have affected us all, regardless of 
income, region, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or age. 
Sadly, both the number of people living with AIDS and the number of new 
HIV infections is rising worldwide. This year, as we observe the tenth 
World AIDS Day, we recognize with particular concern the toll HIV and 
AIDS continue to take on our children and youth.
The statistics are heartbreaking. In America alone, more than 7,500 
children under the age of 13 have been diagnosed with AIDS. Every hour 
of every day, two more Americans under the age of 21 become infected 
with HIV. Around the world, more than 1 million children are living with 
HIV and AIDS. Twelve hundred children die of AIDS each day, even as 
1,600 more become infected with the HIV virus. Compounding this tragedy 
is the terrible reality that many of the world's young people who are 
living with HIV and AIDS do not have access to the life-extending drugs 
and medical protocols that our scientists and doctors have developed. 
There is also a critical shortage of prescription drugs suitable for 
children suffering from pediatric HIV and AIDS. Of the 14 approved drugs 
for adults and adolescents, only five are approved for children.
From the earliest days of my Administration, we have sought to meet the 
challenges posed by AIDS with increased resources and action. I am proud 
of our success, with the cooperation of the Congress, in dramatically 
increasing funding for AIDS prevention measures and research. Such 
programs and research have helped to slow the spread of HIV and AIDS and 
have made possible the production of new drugs that are extending the 
lives of people with HIV and AIDS here at home and around the world.
But our progress against the scourge of AIDS has not been the result of 
government action alone. We have been able to make these great strides 
in understanding and treating HIV and AIDS thanks in large part to the 
hard work and commitment of thousands of researchers, health care 
providers, and clinical trial participants. I am proud as well of the 
resounding response of courage, compassion, responsibility, and love 
that the AIDS crisis has brought forth from our people. The lesbian and 
gay community, particularly in the early years of this epidemic, 
energized existing organizations and created new institutions to respond 
to the unmet needs of those living with HIV and AIDS. Educators and 
activists, members of religious and civic groups, business and labor 
organizations, and tens of thousands of other men and women of goodwill 
have joined together to comfort the afflicted and bring an end to this 
disease.
We can rejoice in our progress, but we cannot rest. In May, I announced 
a new HIV vaccine initiative, and I am pleased that the global community 
has joined together in making the development of this vaccine a top 
inter-

[[Page 180]]
national priority. Within 10 years, we hope to have the means to 
stop this deadly virus. But until we reach that day, I call on every 
American to remain with us on our crusade to eradicate this terrible 
epidemic and care for those living with AIDS along the way. As we mark 
World AIDS Day this year, we must continue to provide care for the sick 
and ensure that all have access to the treatment they need. And one of 
our most important tasks now is to strengthen our efforts to educate 
young people about HIV and AIDS and to make available to them and others 
at high risk effective prevention programs. By giving our children real 
hope for a future free from the shadows of HIV and AIDS, we can best 
commemorate the many loved ones we have already lost to the disease 
during its long and tragic course. May their enduring memory light our 
journey toward a vaccine for HIV and a final cure for AIDS.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 1997, as World 
AIDS Day. I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
reaffirming our commitment to defeating HIV and AIDS and to helping 
those who live with the disease. I encourage every American to 
participate in appropriate commemorative programs and ceremonies in 
workplaces, houses of worship, and other community centers and to reach 
out to protect our children and to help all people who are living with 
AIDS.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7057 of December 1, 1997

National Drunk And Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Driving is a privilege enjoyed by millions of Americans. It offers us 
freedom, mobility, and the chance to discover what lies over the next 
hill or around the next bend in the road. But driving also brings with 
it serious responsibilities. Among the most important of these is a 
driver's responsibility to stay sober. Tragically, many Americans ignore 
this responsibility.
Drunk or drugged drivers are a menace not only to themselves, but also 
to the communities in which they drive. Last year alone, they killed 
more than 17,000 of their fellow citizens and injured thousands more. 
Research has shown that teenage drivers and those aged 21 to 34 are most 
likely to drive under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.


[[Page 181]]
We must reaffirm our commitment to educate these and all drivers about 
the dangers of operating a vehicle after consuming alcohol or drugs, and 
we must strengthen law enforcement efforts that will prevent impaired 
drivers from getting behind the wheel in the first place. We must also 
work together as a national community to make drunk and drugged driving 
socially unacceptable, and continue to support educational programs and 
legislation that teach all our citizens the terrible risks of drunk and 
drugged driving. By doing so, we can prevent thousands of deaths and 
injuries each year and protect our families, our friends, and ourselves 
from becoming victims of this deadly behavior.
I am proud of the ``Zero Alcohol Tolerance'' legislation that 45 States 
and the District of Columbia have adopted, making it illegal for drivers 
under the age of 21 who have been drinking to drive a motor vehicle. I 
call upon all Americans, including policymakers, community leaders, 
State officials, parents, educators, health and medical professionals, 
and other concerned citizens to continue to support such legislation and 
to work together to save lives. I challenge American businesses to take 
a stand against impaired driving both on and off the job and to remember 
that an alcohol- and drug-free workplace is the right and responsibility 
of every worker. Finally, in memory of the thousands who have lost their 
lives to drunk and drugged drivers, I ask all motorists to participate 
in ``National Lights on for Life Day'' on Friday, December 19, 1997, by 
driving with vehicle headlights illuminated. In doing so, we will call 
attention to this critical national problem and remind others on the 
road of their responsibility to drive free of the influence of drugs and 
alcohol.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1997 as National 
Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to 
recognize the dangers of impaired driving; to take responsibility for 
themselves and others around them; to prevent anyone under the influence 
of alcohol or drugs from getting behind the wheel; and to help teach our 
young people about the importance and the benefits of safe driving 
behavior.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7058 of December 5, 1997

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

December 7, 1941, marked a turning point in the history of our Nation, a 
defining moment that would alter the lives of millions of Americans and 
change forever America's destiny. On that quiet Sunday morning, the 
forces

[[Page 182]]
of Imperial Japan attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in 
Hawaii, killing or injuring more than 3,000 Americans, crippling our 
Pacific Fleet, and critically damaging our airpower. In that moment of 
supreme crisis, the essential greatness at the core of the American 
spirit was revealed. Our response was not despair, but determination. 
Inspired by the leadership of President Franklin Roosevelt and buoyed by 
his faith that we ultimately would prevail, America went to war.
Looking back across the years, we rightly are still awed by what the 
American people accomplished during World War II. United in spirit and 
purpose after the attack on Pearl Harbor, millions of men and women 
joined the Armed Forces; by war's end, some 15 million had served. They 
fought fiercely and with uncommon courage in battlefields across the 
globe. In the Pacific, step by bloody and painstaking step, they took 
back the islands captured by Imperial Japanese forces in the days after 
Pearl Harbor. The names of those battles still resonate through the 
years: Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima. On the western front, 
facing the daunting power of the Nazi war machine, Americans and our 
Allies struggled and died to liberate Europe, fighting in the stormy 
North Atlantic, in the searing heat of North Africa, and in the flak-
filled skies over France and Germany.
Americans on the home front responded with equal gallantry and strength. 
Stepping forward to close the gap left by departing servicemen, the very 
young, the elderly, minority workers, and women filled America's 
factories and shipyards. Working around the clock, they built the ships, 
planes, tanks, and guns that armed the forces of freedom and made our 
Nation the ``Arsenal of Democracy.'' In fields, on farms, and in 
neighborhood Victory Gardens, they produced the food to sustain our 
Nation, our troops, and our Allies. Millions left their homes to do 
their part, and few American families were untouched by the hardships 
and sacrifices demanded by this unprecedented effort.
While more than half a century separates us from the attack on Pearl 
Harbor, we still can learn much from the example, achievements, and 
heroic deeds of those Americans who preserved the flame of liberty and 
passed it around the world. They taught us that America is the world's 
best hope for freedom and democracy and that we must never shrink from 
the responsibilities of that leadership. They taught us the need for 
constant vigilance, a powerful military, and strength of character. They 
showed us that, when Americans are united in heart and mind, there is 
nothing we cannot accomplish together.
As we remember Pearl Harbor, let us also remember and give thanks for 
that great and gallant leader, Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose memorial we 
dedicated earlier this year in our Nation's Capital. In December of 
1941, in one of our Nation's darkest hours, he proclaimed his faith in 
the ultimate victory of freedom over tyranny that, sadly, he did not 
live to see:

  With confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination 
of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph. So help us God.

The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, has designated December 7, 1997, as 
``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 1997, as National Pearl

[[Page 183]]
Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in honor of the 
Americans who served at Pearl Harbor. I also ask all Federal departments 
and agencies, organizations, and individuals to fly the flag of the 
United States at half-staff on this day in honor of those Americans who 
died as a result of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  

<R05>
Proclamation 7059 of December 9, 1997

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

Human rights are the cornerstone of American democracy. The founders of 
our democracy, in their wisdom, recognized the inherent dignity of every 
human being and enshrined in the Bill of Rights our profound commitment 
to freedom of speech, religion, and assembly and the right to due 
process and a fair trial. Through more than two centuries of challenge 
and change, these guiding principles have sustained us. They form the 
common ground on which our racial, religious, and ethnic diversity can 
flourish.
It is a measure of our greatness as a Nation that each new generation of 
Americans has sought to advance and extend the rights set forth by 
Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence and by the framers 
of our Constitution. Promoting human rights and democracy around the 
world is a central pillar of our foreign policy. We seek to protect and 
advance human rights for all, not only because a world that respects 
such rights will be freer, safer, and more prosperous, but also so that 
we may keep faith with the vision of our founders, who knew that these 
rights are the deepest reflection of America's fundamental values.
This week marks the beginning of the world's celebration of the 50th 
anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The 
adoption of this set of principles by the United Nations on December 10, 
1948, was a landmark event in the course of modern human history. The 
Declaration represented a collective condemnation by nearly 50 U.N. 
member states of the widespread and devastating human rights abuses 
committed prior to and during World War II, and it reflected a consensus 
on what the postwar world should seek to become. Among the Declaration's 
30 articles are affirmations of the right to life, liberty, and personal 
security; the right to freedom of thought, religion, and expression; and 
the right to freedom from slavery, torture, and arbitrary arrest and 
detention.
It was fitting that a great American, Eleanor Roosevelt, played a 
pivotal role in the development of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, which

[[Page 184]]
so closely reflected the tenets of our own Bill of Rights. 
As Chair of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, she led the efforts of 
its 18 members to define basic rights and freedoms and to draft the 
international affirmation of rights that was ultimately adopted by the 
General Assembly. Today, thanks to those efforts, scores of countries 
across the globe have incorporated these fundamental principles into 
their laws and practices, and millions of people are leading freer, 
happier, and more fulfilling lives.
Now our challenge is to reaffirm the universality of these precepts and 
to ensure that all the world's peoples share in their protections. While 
we have made great progress in this endeavor, we must recognize that 
intolerance, discrimination, and persecution continue to darken our 
vision of a better future. Each of us has a part to play in upholding 
human rights for men and women of all political, ethnic, religious, and 
racial backgrounds. The words of Eleanor Roosevelt are both an 
inspiration and a challenge, not only to Americans, but also to citizens 
throughout the international community: ``The destiny of human rights is 
in the hands of all of our citizens and all of our communities.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1997, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 1997, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 1997, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to celebrate these observances with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that demonstrate our 
national commitment to the Bill of Rights, the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, and the promotion of human rights for all people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7060 of December 12, 1997

Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Who Are 
Senior Officials of the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola (``UNITA'') and Adult Members of Their Immediate Families

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

In light of the failure of the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola (``UNITA'') to comply with its obligations under the 
``Accordos de Paz,'' the Lusaka Protocol, and other components of the 
peace process in Angola, and in furtherance of United Nations Security 
Council Resolution 1127 of August 28, 1997, 1130 of September 29, 1997, 
and 1135 of October 29, 1997, I have determined that it is in the 
foreign policy interests of the

[[Page 185]]
United States to restrict the entry into 
the United States of aliens described in section 1 of this proclamation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, by the power vested in me as 
President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the 
United States of America, including sections 212(f) and 215 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f) 
and 1185), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, hereby find 
that the entry into the United States of aliens described in section 1 
of this proclamation as immigrants or nonimmigrants would, except as 
provided for in section 2 of this proclamation, be detrimental to the 
interests of the United States. I do therefore proclaim that:
Section 1. The entry into the United States as immigrants and 
nonimmigrants of senior officials of UNITA and adult members of their 
immediate families, is hereby suspended.
Sec. 2. Section 1 shall not apply with respect to any person otherwise 
covered by section 1 where the entry of such person would not be 
contrary to the interests of the United States.
Sec. 3. Persons covered by section 1 and 2 shall be identified by the 
Secretary of State.
Sec. 4. In identifying persons covered by section 2, the Secretary shall 
consider whether a person otherwise covered by section 1 is an official 
necessary for the full functioning of the Government of Unity and 
National Reconciliation, the National Assembly, or the Joint Commission, 
within the meaning of paragraph 4(a) of United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1127 of August 28, 1997.
Sec. 5. This proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in 
effect until such time as the Secretary of State determines that it is 
no longer necessary and should be terminated.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of State is hereby authorized to implement this 
proclamation pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary of State may 
establish.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-seven, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-second.

Proclamation 7061 of December 16, 1997

Wright Brothers Day, 1997

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

On December 17, 1903, Orville Wright lay inside the first heavier-than-
air powered craft that permitted controlled flight. His brother Wilbur 
stood nearby, steadying the craft at one wing tip. In a few moments, the 
brothers

[[Page 186]]
would know if their years of hard work and painstaking 
experimentation would finally bear fruit. With Wilbur running beside the 
plane to build its momentum, Orville achieved, for a scant 12 seconds 
over a distance of 120 feet, what humankind had always dreamed of--he 
flew.
That historic moment marked the first step in a long journey through the 
skies that would ultimately take Americans beyond Earth's atmosphere and 
into space. The Mars Pathfinder spacecraft that captured the world's 
attention and imagination this past summer reflects the same American 
ingenuity and pioneering spirit that sent the Wrights' fragile craft 
aloft so briefly over Kitty Hawk almost a century ago. With unwavering 
perseverance in the face of many failures, steady conviction in the 
possibility of flight, and a determination to bring their vision to 
reality, the Wright brothers expanded our horizons and also brought the 
world closer together.
We are still reaping the benefits of their extraordinary achievement. 
America's aerospace industry has experienced enormous growth and 
development since the Wright brothers' first flight. It has strengthened 
our economy, created new business and recreational opportunities, freed 
us from many of the limits of time and distance, and made our Nation's 
aviation system the finest in the world. And thanks in large part to the 
efforts of the men and women throughout the Federal Government--in the 
Departments of Transportation and Defense, the National Transportation 
Safety Board, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--
that system is also the safest in the world.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963 (77 Stat. 
402; 36 U.S.C. 169), has designated December 17 of each year as ``Wright 
Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested the President to issue 
annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to 
observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 1997, as Wright Brothers Day.

Executive Order 13045 of April 21, 1997

Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy.
    1-101. A growing body of scientific knowledge demonstrates that 
children may suffer disproportionately from environmental health risks 
and safety risks. These risks arise because: children's neurological, 
immunological, digestive, and other bodily systems are still developing; 
children eat more food, drink more fluids, and breathe more air in 
proportion to their body weight than adults; children's size and weight 
may diminish their protection from standard safety features; and 
children's behavior patterns may make them more susceptible to accidents 
because they are less able to protect themselves. Therefore, to the 
extent permitted by law and appropriate, and consistent with the 
agency's mission, each Federal agency:
(a) shall make it a high priority to identify and assess 
environmental health risks and safety risks that may 
disproportionately affect children; and

(b) shall ensure that its policies, programs, activities, and 
standards address disproportionate risks to children that result 
from environmental health risks or safety risks.
    1-102. Each independent regulatory agency is encouraged to 
participate in the implementation of this order and comply with its 
provisions.
Sec. 2. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this 
order.
    2-201. ``Federal agency'' means any authority of the United States 
that is an agency under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1) other than those considered to 
be independent regulatory agencies under 44 U.S.C. 3502(5). For purposes 
of this order, ``military departments,'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, are 
covered under the auspices of the Department of Defense.
    2-202. ``Covered regulatory action'' means any substantive action in 
a rulemaking, initiated after the date of this order or for which a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published 1 year after the date of this 
order, that is likely to result in a rule that may:
(a) be ``economically significant'' under Executive Order 12866 (a 
rulemaking that has an annual effect on the economy of $100 
million or more or would adversely affect in a material way the 
economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, 
the envi-

[[Page 199]]
ronment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
tribal governments or communities); and

(b) concern an environmental health risk or safety risk that an 
agency has reason to believe may disproportionately affect 
children.
    2-203. ``Environmental health risks and safety risks'' mean risks to 
health or to safety that are attributable to products or substances that 
the child is likely to come in contact with or ingest (such as the air 
we breath, the food we eat, the water we drink or use for recreation, 
the soil we live on, and the products we use or are exposed to).
Sec. 3. Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to 
Children.
    3-301. There is hereby established the Task Force on Environmental 
Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children (``Task Force'').
    3-302. The Task Force will report to the President in consultation 
with the Domestic Policy Council, the National Science and Technology 
Council, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB).
    3-303. Membership. The Task Force shall be composed of the:
(a) Secretary of Health and Human Services, who shall serve as a 
Co-Chair of the Council;

(b) Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who 
shall serve as a Co-Chair of the Council;

(c) Secretary of Education;

(d) Secretary of Labor;

(e) Attorney General;

(f) Secretary of Energy;

(g) Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;

(h) Secretary of Agriculture;

(i) Secretary of Transportation;

(j) Director of the Office of Management and Budget;

(k) Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality;

(l) Chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission;

(m) Assistant to the President for Economic Policy;

(n) Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy;

(o) Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy;

(p) Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; and

(q) Such other officials of executive departments and agencies as 
the President may, from time to time, designate.
Members of the Task Force may delegate their responsibilities under this 
order to subordinates.
    3-304. Functions. The Task Force shall recommend to the President 
Federal strategies for children's environmental health and safety, 
within the limits of the Administration's budget, to include the 
following elements:

[[Page 200]]

(a) statements of principles, general policy, and targeted annual 
priorities to guide the Federal approach to achieving the goals of 
this order;

(b) a coordinated research agenda for the Federal Government, 
including steps to implement the review of research databases 
described in section 4 of this order;

(c) recommendations for appropriate partnerships among Federal, 
State, local, and tribal governments and the private, academic, 
and nonprofit sectors;

(d) proposals to enhance public outreach and communication to 
assist families in evaluating risks to children and in making 
informed consumer choices;

(e) an identification of high-priority initiatives that the 
Federal Government has undertaken or will undertake in advancing 
protection of children's environmental health and safety; and

(f) a statement regarding the desirability of new legislation to 
fulfill or promote the purposes of this order.
    3-305. The Task Force shall prepare a biennial report on research, 
data, or other information that would enhance our ability to understand, 
analyze, and respond to environmental health risks and safety risks to 
children. For purposes of this report, cabinet agencies and other 
agencies identified by the Task Force shall identify and specifically 
describe for the Task Force key data needs related to environmental 
health risks and safety risks to children that have arisen in the course 
of the agency's programs and activities. The Task Force shall 
incorporate agency submissions into its report and ensure that this 
report is publicly available and widely disseminated. The Office of 
Science and Technology Policy and the National Science and Technology 
Council shall ensure that this report is fully considered in 
establishing research priorities.
    3-306. The Task Force shall exist for a period of 4 years from the 
first meeting. At least 6 months prior to the expiration of that period, 
the member agencies shall assess the need for continuation of the Task 
Force or its functions, and make appropriate recommendations to the 
President.
Sec. 4. Research Coordination and Integration.
    4-401. Within 6 months of the date of this order, the Task Force 
shall develop or direct to be developed a review of existing and planned 
data resources and a proposed plan for ensuring that researchers and 
Federal research agencies have access to information on all research 
conducted or funded by the Federal Government that is related to adverse 
health risks in children resulting from exposure to environmental health 
risks or safety risks. The National Science and Technology Council shall 
review the plan.
    4-402. The plan shall promote the sharing of information on academic 
and private research. It shall include recommendations to encourage that 
such data, to the extent permitted by law, is available to the public, 
the scientific and academic communities, and all Federal agencies.
Sec. 5. Agency Environmental Health Risk or Safety Risk Regulations.
    5-501. For each covered regulatory action submitted to OMB's Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for review pursuant to 
Executive Order 12866, the issuing agency shall provide to OIRA the 
following infor-

[[Page 201]]
mation developed as part of the agency's decisionmaking 
process, unless prohibited by law:
(a) an evaluation of the environmental health or safety effects of 
the planned regulation on children; and

(b) an explanation of why the planned regulation is preferable to 
other potentially effective and reasonably feasible alternatives 
considered by the agency.
    5-502. In emergency situations, or when an agency is obligated by 
law to act more quickly than normal review procedures allow, the agency 
shall comply with the provisions of this section to the extent 
practicable. For those covered regulatory actions that are governed by a 
court-imposed or statutory deadline, the agency shall, to the extent 
practicable, schedule any rulemaking proceedings so as to permit 
sufficient time for completing the analysis required by this section.
    5-503. The analysis required by this section may be included as part 
of any other required analysis, and shall be made part of the 
administrative record for the covered regulatory action or otherwise 
made available to the public, to the extent permitted by law.
Sec. 6. Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics.
    6-601. The Director of the OMB (``Director'') shall convene an 
Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics (``Forum''), which will 
include representatives from the appropriate Federal statistics and 
research agencies. The Forum shall produce an annual compendium 
(``Report'') of the most important indicators of the well-being of the 
Nation's children.
    6-602. The Forum shall determine the indicators to be included in 
each Report and identify the sources of data to be used for each 
indicator. The Forum shall provide an ongoing review of Federal 
collection and dissemination of data on children and families, and shall 
make recommendations to improve the coverage and coordination of data 
collection and to reduce duplication and overlap.
    6-603. The Report shall be published by the Forum in collaboration 
with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. The 
Forum shall present the first annual Report to the President, through 
the Director, by July 31, 1997. The Report shall be submitted annually 
thereafter, using the most recently available data.
Sec. 7. General Provisions.
    7-701. This order is intended only for internal management of the 
executive branch. This order is not intended, and should not be 
construed to create, any right, benefit, or trust responsibility, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party 
against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or its employees.

Executive Order 13048 of June 10, 1997

Improving Administrative Management in the Executive Branch

Improvement of Government operations is a continuing process that 
benefits from interagency activities. One group dedicated to such 
activities is the President's Council on Management Improvement (PCMI), 
established by Executive Order 12479 in 1984, reestablished by Executive 
Order 12816 in 1992. In the intervening years, some activities of the 
PCMI have been assumed by the President's Management Council, the Chief 
Financial Officers Council, and the Chief Information Officers Council. 
These organizations are also focussed on improving agencies' use of 
quality management principles. Other functions have been assigned to 
individual agencies. Nonetheless, remaining administrative management 
matters deserve attention across agency lines.
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America and in order to improve agency 
administrative and management practices throughout the executive branch, 
I hereby direct the following:
Section 1. Interagency Council on Administrative Management.

for membership on the Council. Council membership shall also include 
representatives of the Chief Financial Officers Council, the Chief 
Information Officers Council, the Federal Procurement Council, the 
Interagency Advisory Group of Federal Personnel Directors, and the Small 
Agency Council, as well as at-large members appointed by the Chair, as 
he deems appropriate. The Chair shall invite representatives of the

appropriate. The Council shall select a Vice Chair from among the 
Council's membership.
    (b) The Council shall plan, promote, and recommend improvements in

Directors designed to develop, review, revise, and implement 
Governmentwide administrative management policies; and


(3) identify successful administrative management practices, 
including quality management practices, and assist in their 
Governmentwide dissemination and implementation.

Sec. 2. Responsibilities of the Chair. The Chair or, if the Chair 
chooses, the Vice Chair shall:

    (1) convene meetings of the Council;

    (2) preside at formal council meetings;

    (3) establish committees or working groups of the Council, as 
        necessary for efficient conduct of Council functions; and

    (4) appoint, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with 
        personnel practices, other full-time officers or employees of

        specific terms, not exceeding 2 years, to provide expertise to 
        the Council.

Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Agency Heads. To the extent permitted by 
law, heads of departments or agencies represented on the Council shall 
provide their representatives with administrative support needed to 
support Council activities.
Sec. 4. Judicial Review. This order is for the internal management of 
the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United 
States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person.
Sec. 5. Revocation. Executive Order 12816 (creating the President's 
Council on Management Improvement), Executive Order 12552 (establishing 
the executive branch productivity improvement program) and Executive 
Order 12637 (revising the executive branch productivity improvement 
program) are revoked.

Protecting Federal Employees and the Public From Exposure to Tobacco 
Smoke in the Federal Workplace

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America and in order to protect Federal 
Government employees and members of the public from exposure to tobacco 
smoke in the Federal workplace, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy.  It is the policy of the executive branch to 
establish a smoke-free environment for Federal employees and members of 
the public visiting or using Federal facilities. The smoking of tobacco 
products is thus prohibited in all interior space owned, rented, or 
leased by the executive branch of the Federal Government, and in any 
outdoor areas under executive branch control in front of air intake 
ducts.
Sec. 2. Exceptions.  The general policy established by this order is 
subject to the following exceptions: (a) The order does not apply in 
designated smoking areas that are enclosed and exhausted directly to the 
outside and away from air intake ducts, and are maintained under 
negative pressure (with respect to surrounding spaces) sufficient to 
contain tobacco smoke within the designated area. Agency officials shall 
not require workers to enter such areas during business hours while 
smoking is ongoing.
    (b) The order does not extend to any residential accommodation for 
persons voluntarily or involuntarily residing, on a temporary or long-
term basis, in a building owned, leased, or rented by the Federal 
Government.
    (c) The order does not extend to those portions of federally owned 
buildings leased, rented, or otherwise provided in their entirety to 
nonfederal parties.
    (d) The order does not extend to places of employment in the private 
sector or in other nonfederal governmental units that serve as the 
permanent or intermittent duty station of one or more Federal employees.
    (e) The head of any agency may establish limited and narrow 
exceptions that are necessary to accomplish agency missions. Such 
exception shall be in writing, approved by the agency head, and to the 
fullest extent possible provide protection of nonsmokers from exposure 
to environmental tobacco smoke. Authority to establish such exceptions 
may not be delegated.
Sec. 3. Other Locations.  The heads of agencies shall evaluate the need 
to restrict smoking at doorways and in courtyards under executive branch 
control in order to protect workers and visitors from environmental 
tobacco smoke, and may restrict smoking in these areas in light of this 
evaluation.
Sec. 4. Smoking Cessation Programs.  The heads of agencies are 
encouraged to use existing authority to establish programs designed to 
help employees stop smoking.
Sec. 5. Responsibility for Implementation.  The heads of agencies are 
responsible for implementing and ensuring compliance with the provisions 
of this order. ``Agency'' as used in this order means an Executive 
agency, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, and includes any employing unit or 
authority of the Federal Government, other than those of the legislative 
and judicial

[[Page 217]]
branches. Independent agencies are encouraged to comply 
with the provisions of this order.
Sec. 6. Phase-In of Implementation.  Implementation of the policy set 
forth in this order shall be achieved no later than 1 year after the 
date of this order. This 1 year phase-in period is designed to establish 
a fixed but reasonable time for implementing this policy. Agency heads 
are directed during this period to inform all employees and visitors to 
executive branch facilities about the requirements of this order, inform 
their employees of the health risks of exposure to environmental tobacco 
smoke, and undertake related activities as necessary.
Sec. 7. Consistency with Other Laws.  The provisions of this order shall 
be implemented consistent with applicable law, including the Federal 
Service Labor-Management Relations Act (5 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) and the 
National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) Provisions of 
existing collective bargaining agreements shall be honored and agencies 
shall consult with employee labor representatives about the 
implementation of this order. Nothing herein shall be construed to 
impair or alter the powers and duties of Federal agencies established 
under law. Nothing herein shall be construed to replace any agency 
policy currently in effect, if such policy is legally established, in 
writing, and consistent with the terms of this order. Agencies shall 
review their current policy to confirm that agency policy comports with 
this order, and policy found not in compliance shall be revised to 
comply with the terms of this order.
Sec. 8. Cause of Action.  This order does not create any right to 
administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit, 
substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United 
States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person or affect in any way the liability of the executive 
branch under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
Sec. 9. Construction.  Nothing in this order shall limit an agency head 
from establishing more protective policies on smoking in the Federal 
workplace for employees and members of the public visiting or using 
Federal facilities.

Executive Order 13060 of August 21, 1997

Establishing an Emergency Board To Investigate Disputes Between Amtrak 
and its Employees Represented by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way 
Employes

Disputes exist between Amtrak and its employees represented by the 
Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes.
These disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of 
the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) (the ``Act'').
In the judgement of the National Mediation Board, these disputes 
threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree that 
would deprive a section of the country of essential transportation 
service.
NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States; including section 10 of 
the Act (45 U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment of Emergency Board (``Board''). There is 
established, effective August 21, 1997, a Board of three members to be 
appointed by the President to investigate these disputes. No member 
shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of 
railroad employees or any railroad carrier. The Board shall perform its 
functions subject to the availability of funds.
Sec. 2. Report. The Board shall report to the President with respect to 
these disputes within 30 days of its creation.
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by section 10 of the Act, 
from the date of the creation of the Board and for 30 days after the 
Board has submitted its report to the President, no change in the 
conditions out of which the disputes arose shall be made by the parties 
to the controversy, except by agreement of the parties.
Sec. 4. Records Maintenance. The records and files of the Board are 
records of the Office of the President and upon the Board's termination 
shall be maintained in the physical custody of the National Mediation 
Board.
Sec. 5. Expiration. The Board shall terminate upon the submission of the 
report provided for in sections 2 and 3 of this order.

Executive Order 13061 of September 11, 1997

Federal Support of Community Efforts Along American Heritage Rivers

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the National 
Environmental Pol-

[[Page 222]]
icy Act of 1969 (Public Law 91-190), and in order to 
protect and restore rivers and their adjacent communities, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policies.
    (a) The American Heritage Rivers initiative has three objectives: 
natural resource and environmental protection, economic revitalization, 
and historic and cultural preservation.
    (b) Executive agencies (``agencies''), to the extent permitted by 
law and consistent with their missions and resources, shall coordinate 
Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to preserve, protect, 
and restore rivers and their associated resources important to our 
history, culture, and natural heritage.
    (c) Agencies shall develop plans to bring increased efficiencies to 
existing and authorized programs with goals that are supportive of 
protection and restoration of communities along rivers.
    (d) In accordance with Executive Order 12630, agencies shall act 
with due regard for the protection of private property provided for by 
the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. No new regulatory 
authority is created as a result of the American Heritage Rivers 
initiative. This initiative will not interfere with matters of State, 
local, and tribal government jurisdiction.
    (e) In furtherance of these policies, the President will designate 
rivers that meet certain criteria as ``American Heritage Rivers.''
    (f) It is the policy of the Federal Government that communities 
shall nominate rivers as American Heritage Rivers and the Federal role 
will be solely to support community-based efforts to preserve, protect, 
and restore these rivers and their communities.
    (g) Agencies should, to the extent practicable, help identify 
resources in the private and nonprofit sectors to aid revitalization 
efforts.
    (h) Agencies are encouraged, to the extent permitted by law, to 
develop partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments and 
community and nongovernmental organizations. Agencies will be responsive 
to the diverse needs of different kinds of communities from the core of 
our cities to remote rural areas and shall seek to ensure that the role 
played by the Federal Government is complementary to the plans and work 
being carried out by State, local, and tribal governments. To the extent 
possible, Federal resources will be strategically directed to complement 
resources being spent by these governments.
    (i) Agencies shall establish a method for field offices to assess 
the success of the American Heritage River initiative and provide a 
means to recommend changes that will improve the delivery and 
accessibility of Federal services and programs. Agencies are directed, 
where appropriate, to reduce and make more flexible procedural 
requirements and paperwork related to providing assistance to 
communities along designated rivers.
    (j) Agencies shall commit to a policy under which they will seek to 
ensure that their actions have a positive effect on the natural, 
historic, economic, and cultural resources of American Heritage River 
communities. The policy will require agencies to consult with American 
Heritage River communities early in the planning stages of Federal 
actions, take into ac-

[[Page 223]]
count the communities' goals and objectives and 
ensure that actions are compatible with the overall character of these 
communities. Agencies shall seek to ensure that their help for one 
community does not adversely affect neighboring communities. 
Additionally, agencies are encouraged to develop formal and informal 
partnerships to assist communities. Local Federal facilities, to the 
extent permitted by law and consistent with the agencies' missions and 
resources, should provide public access, physical space, technical 
assistance, and other support for American Heritage River communities.
    (k) In addition to providing support to designated rivers, agencies 
will work together to provide information and services to all 
communities seeking support.
Sec. 2. Process for Nominating an American Heritage River.
    (a) Nomination. Communities, in coordination with their State, 
local, or tribal governments, can nominate their river, river stretch, 
or river confluence for designation as an American Heritage River. When 
several communities are involved in the nomination of the same river, 
nominations will detail the coordination among the interested 
communities and the role each will play in the process. Individuals 
living outside the community may not nominate a river.
    (b) Selection Criteria. Nominations will be judged based on the 
following:
      (1) the characteristics of the natural, economic, agricultural, 
scenic, historic, cultural, or recreational resources of the river that 
render it distinctive or unique;
      (2) the effectiveness with which the community has defined its 
plan of action and the extent to which the plan addresses, either 
through planned actions or past accomplishments, all three American 
Heritage Rivers objectives, which are set forth in section 1(a) of this 
order;
      (3) the strength and diversity of community support for the 
nomination as evidenced by letters from elected officials; landowners; 
private citizens; businesses; and especially State, local, and tribal 
governments. Broad community support is essential to receiving the 
American Heritage River designation; and
      (4) willingness and capability of the community to forge 
partnerships and agreements to implement their plan to meet their goals 
and objectives.
    (c) Recommendation Process.
    The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (``CEQ'') shall 
develop a fair and objective procedure to obtain the views of a diverse 
group of experts for the purpose of making recommendations to the 
President as to which rivers shall be designated. These experts shall 
reflect a variety of viewpoints, such as those representing natural, 
cultural, and historic resources; scenic, environmental, and recreation 
interests; tourism, transportation, and economic development interests; 
and industries such as agriculture, hydropower, manufacturing, mining, 
and forest management. The Chair of the CEQ will ensure that the rivers 
recommended represent a variety of stream sizes, diverse geographical 
locations, and a wide range of settings from urban to rural and ensure 
that relatively pristine, successful revi-

[[Page 224]]
talization efforts are 
considered as well as degraded rivers in need of restoration.
    (d) Designation.
      (1) The President will designate certain rivers as American 
Heritage Rivers. Based on the receipt of a sufficient number of 
qualified nominations, ten rivers will be designated in the first phase 
of the initiative.
      (2) The Interagency Committee provided for in section 3 of this 
order shall develop a process by which any community that nominates and 
has its river designated may have this designation terminated at its 
request.
      (3) Upon a determination by the Chair of the CEQ that a community 
has failed to implement its plan, the Chair may recommend to the 
President that a designation be revoked. The Chair shall notify the 
community at least 30 days prior to making such a recommendation to the 
President. Based on that recommendation, the President may revoke the 
designation.
Sec. 3. Establishment of an Interagency Committee. There is hereby 
established the American Heritage Rivers Interagency Committee 
(``Committee''). The Committee shall have two co-chairs. The Chair of 
the CEQ shall be a permanent co-chair. The other co-chair will rotate 
among the heads of the agencies listed below.
    (a) The Committee shall be composed of the following members or 
their designees at the Assistant Secretary level or equivalent:
      (1) The Secretary of Defense;
      (2) The Attorney General;
      (3) The Secretary of the Interior;
      (4) The Secretary of Agriculture;
      (5) The Secretary of Commerce;

      (12) The Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
    The Chair of the CEQ may invite to participate in meetings of the 
Committee, representatives of other agencies, as appropriate.
    (b) The Committee shall:
      (1) establish formal guidelines for designation as an American 
Heritage River;
      (2) periodically review the actions of agencies in support of the 
American Heritage Rivers;
      (3) report to the President on the progress, accomplishments, and 
effectiveness of the American Heritage Rivers initiative; and

[[Page 225]]
      (4) perform other duties as directed by the Chair of the CEQ.
Sec. 4. Responsibilities of the Federal Agencies. Consistent with Title 
I of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, agencies shall:
    (a) identify their existing programs and plans that give them the 
authority to offer assistance to communities involved in river 
conservation and community health and revitalization;
    (b) to the extent practicable and permitted by law and regulation, 
refocus programs, grants, and technical assistance to provide support 
for communities adjacent to American Heritage Rivers;
    (c) identify all technical tools, including those developed for 
purposes other than river conservation, that can be applied to river 
protection, restoration, and community revitalization;
    (d) provide access to existing scientific data and information to 
the extent permitted by law and consistent with the agencies mission and 
resources;
    (e) cooperate with State, local, and tribal governments and 
communities with respect to their activities that take place in, or 
affect the area around, an American Heritage River;
    (f) commit to a policy, as set forth in section 1(j) of this order, 
in making decisions affecting the quality of an American Heritage River;
    (g) select from among all the agencies a single individual called 
the ``River Navigator,'' for each river that is designated an American 
Heritage River, with whom the communities can communicate goals and 
needs and who will facilitate community-agency interchange;
    (h) allow public access to the river, for agencies with facilities 
along American Heritage Rivers, to the extent practicable and consistent 
with their mission; and
    (i) cooperate, as appropriate, with communities on projects that 
protect or preserve stretches of the river that are on Federal property 
or adjacent to a Federal facility.
Sec. 5. Responsibilities of the Committee and the Council on 
Environmental Quality. The CEQ shall serve as Executive agent for the 
Committee, and the CEQ and the Committee shall ensure the implementation 
of the policies and purposes of this initiative.
Sec. 6. Definition. For the purposes of this order, Executive agency 
means any agency on the Committee and such other agency as may be 
designated by the President.
Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order does not create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the 
United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or 
employees, or any other person.

Notice of January 2, 1997

Continuation of Libyan Emergency

On January 7, 1986, by Executive Order No. 12543, President Reagan 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Libya. On 
January 8, 1986, by Executive Order No. 12544, the President took 
additional measures to block Libyan assets in the United States. The 
President has transmitted a notice continuing this emergency to the 
Congress and the Federal Register every year since 1986. The most recent 
notice appeared in the Federal Register on January 5, 1996.
The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been 
resolved. The Government of Libya has continued its actions and policies 
in support of terrorism, despite the calls by the United Nations 
Security Council, in Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 883 (1993), 
that it demonstrate by concrete actions its renunciation of such 
terrorism. Such Libyan actions and policies pose a continuing unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national

[[Page 246]]

security and vital foreign 
policy interests of the United States. For these reasons, the national 
emergency declared on January 7, 1986, and the measures adopted on 
January 7 and January 8, 1986, to deal with that emergency, must 
continue in effect beyond January 7, 1997. Therefore, in accordance with 
Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Libya. This notice 
shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the 
Congress.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    January 2, 1997.



Notice of January 21, 1997

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt 
the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists 
that disrupt the Middle East peace process. By Executive Order 12947 of 
January 23, 1995, I blocked the assets in the United States, or in the 
control of United States persons, of foreign terrorists who threaten to 
disrupt the Middle East peace process. I also prohibited transactions or 
dealings by United States persons in such property. Because terrorists 
activities continue to threaten the Middle East peace process and vital 
interests of the United States in the Middle East, the national 
emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures that took 
effect on January 24, 1995, to deal with that emergency must continue in 
effect beyond January 23, 1997. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who 
threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    January 21, 1997.


Presidential Determination No. 97-16 of February 12, 1997

Immigration Emergency Resulting From Alien Smuggling

Memorandum for the Attorney General

In September 1995, I determined that an immigration emergency was in 
existence with respect to the smuggling into the United States of 
illegal

[[Page 247]]
aliens. I therefore directed the use of up to $6,000,000 from 
the Immigration Emergency Fund to cover costs associated with 
repatriation of foreign nationals intercepted en route to the United 
States. To date, all but $700,000 of that amount has been used to cover 
these costs. While our policy to deter smuggling activity has been 
successful, attempts to smuggle illegal aliens persist and require 
continued efforts on the part of the United States.
Accordingly, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 
404(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, I hereby:
    LDetermine that the immigration emergency determined to exist in 
1995 with respect to the smuggling into the United States of illegal 
aliens persists; and

    LDirect that up to $7,400,000 appropriated by the Congress to the 
Immigration Emergency Fund be used to cover costs associated with the 
repatriation of foreign nationals intercepted en route to the United 
States.
You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees of 
the Congress of this determination and the obligation of funds under 
this authority and to publish it in the Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 97-17 of February 21, 1997

Facilitation Act of 1995, title VI, Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1996, Public Law 
104-107 (``the Act''), I hereby:
    (1) Certify that it is in the national interest to suspend the

(B) Section 114 of the Department of State Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (22 U.S.C. 287e note), as it applies

associated with it;

(C) Section 1003 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 5202); and

(D) Section 37, Bretton Woods Agreement Act (22 U.S.C. 286w), as 
it applies to the granting to the Palestine Liberation 
Organization of


[[Page 248]]
observer status or other official status at any 
meeting sponsored by or associated with the International Monetary 
Fund.
    (2) certify that the Palestine Liberation Organization, the 
Palestinian Authority, and successor entities are complying with the 
commitments described in section 604(b)(4) of the Act.
    (3) certify that funds provided pursuant to the exercise of the 
authority of the Act and the authorities under section 583(a) of Public 
Law 103-236 and section 3(a) of Public Law 103-125 have been used for 
the purposes for which they were intended.
You are authorized and directed to transmit this determination to the 
Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.

THE WHITE HOUSE,

Notice of February 27, 1997

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, I declared a national emergency 
to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of international 
rela-

[[Page 249]]
tions caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by the Government 
of Cuba of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1995, the Government of 
Cuba demonstrated a ready and reckless use of force against U.S. 
registered vessels that entered into Cuban territorial waters that 
resulted in damage and injury to persons on board. In July 1996, the 
Government of Cuba stated its intent to forcefully defend its 
sovereignty against any U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft that might 
enter Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a memorial 
flotilla and peaceful protest. Since these events, the Government of 
Cuba has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the future use of 
reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may 
engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation 
of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in Proclamation 6867.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 97-18 of February 28, 1997

Certification for Major Narcotics Producing and Transit Countries

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 490(b)(1)(A) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, (``the Act''), I hereby 
determine and certify that the following major drug producing and/or 
major drug transit countries/dependent territories have cooperated fully 
with the United States, or taken adequate steps on their own, to achieve 
full compliance with the goals and objectives of the 1988 United Nations 
Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances:

  Aruba, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Dominican 
Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, 
Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, 
and Vietnam.

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 490(b)(1)(B) of the 
Act, I hereby determine that it is in the vital national interests of 
the United States to certify the following major illicit drug producing 
and/or transit countries:

    Belize, Lebanon, and Pakistan.


Analysis of the relevant U.S. vital national interests, as required 
under section 490(b)(3) of the Act, is attached. I have determined that 
the following

[[Page 250]]
major illicit drug producing and/or major transit 
countries do not meet the standards set forth in section 490(b) for 
certification:

    Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria, and Syria.

In making these determinations, I have considered the factors set forth 
in section 490 of the Act, based on the information contained in the 
International Narcotics Control Strategy Report of 1997. Because the 
performance of each of these countries/dependent territories has 
differed, I have attached an explanatory statement for each of the 
countries/dependent territories subject to this determination.
You are hereby authorized and directed to report this determination to 
the Congress immediately and to publish it in the Federal Register.

    Washington, February 28, 1997.

STATEMENTS OF EXPLANATION
Aruba

    Aruba is a major trafficking and staging point for international 
narcotics trafficking organizations which transship cocaine and heroin 
from Colombia, Venezuela and Suriname to the United States and Europe. 
Its key position near the Venezuelan coast with air and sea links to 
South America, Europe, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean locations makes 
it a prime transshipment point. Drug shipments are made primarily via 
containerized cargo, but commercial airlines and cruise ships are also 
used. Although USG law enforcement agencies estimate that about 155 mt 
of cocaine are transshipped through the Caribbean to the United States 
annually, and that more than 100 international trafficking organizations 
operate in that region, Aruba seized only about 170 kg of cocaine and 
about 2\1/2\ kg of heroin in 1996.
    Money laundering organizations use legitimate companies as fronts to 
invest in land development and other construction projects. The 
Government of Aruba's (GOA) Free Trade Zone (FTZ), casinos and resort 
complexes are reported to be attractive venues for money laundering and 
smuggling. A joint Dutch-Aruban Commission in 1996 issued 
recommendations to improve regulation of the FTZ, and invited a U.S. 
Customs technical expert to help implement those recommendations. 
Legislation on the FTZ, casinos and off-shore corporations is pending.
    Aruba is a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (GON), and has 
independent decision-making ability in many drug policy areas. The 
Kingdom of the Netherlands (GON), a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, has not yet extended it to Aruba. The Aruban legislature is 
in the final stages of considering comprehensive criminal law reform, 
expected to be adopted in 1997. The law would create a basis for the 
Kingdom's extension of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, for expanded 
investigative powers for local law enforcement, as well as for 
extradition of nationals subject to service of sentences in Aruba.


[[Page 251]]

    The GOA participated with the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles 
in the establishment of a joint Kingdom-Caribbean Coast Guard, designed 
to patrol the Kingdom's Caribbean coastal waters to interdict drug 
shipments. The GOA established money transaction monitoring entities to 
review unusual transactions in the banking sector. Aruban law 
enforcement officials participated in USG-sponsored training courses for 
drug enforcement during 1996. The GOA has taken limited steps to punish 
corrupt officials, and replaced senior police and justice officials in 
Aruba.
    Corruption is a problem that hinders effective efforts against 
international narcotics traffickers. A joint Netherlands Antilles and 
Aruba court denied a USG extradition request for a Colombian narcotics 
trafficker in 1996. Despite these problems, Aruba generally cooperated 
with the USG to meet the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention.

The Bahamas

    Over the past ten years, successful combined U.S./Bahamian 
counternarcotics efforts have dramatically reduced the amount of cocaine 
and marijuana transiting The Bahamas en route to the United States. This 
downward trend has continued over the last several years. Nevertheless, 
significant quantities of illicit drugs continue to pass through The 
Bahamas. The Bahamas is also a dynamic financial services center and a 
tax haven with bank secrecy laws, which are both factors conducive to 
money laundering. Some marijuana is grown in The Bahamas, but the 
country is not a major drug producer.
    The Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas (GCOB) vigorously 
strives to combat drug trafficking and is extraordinarily cooperative 
with USG counterdrug efforts. The first country to ratify the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention, The Bahamas took further steps during 1996 to implement 
it. Strong anti-money laundering legislation and implementing 
regulations entered into force in 1996. During the year, the GCOB 
continued its successful efforts to strengthen its justice system, with 
assistance from the USG. U.S. and Bahamian law enforcement officials 
continued to work closely together to apprehend drug traffickers. 
Domestic drug abuse remains a problem, but the number of new drug users 
has declined notably since the mid-1980s. Over the past several years, 
The Bahamas has prosecuted and convicted some middle and low-level 
officials on charges of narcotics corruption. The GCOB is also making 
some headway in its efforts to forfeit and dispose of trafficker assets.
    Although enormous progress has been made, more can be done. In 
coming years, The Bahamas should continue to improve the effectiveness 
with which its justice system handles drug cases, further emphasize 
forfeiture of trafficker assets and effectively enforce its new anti-
money laundering controls.

Bolivia

    The Government of Bolivia sustained an intense counternarcotics 
effort again in 1996, cooperating fully with the USG, and took adequate 
steps toward full compliance with the goals and objectives of the 1988 
UN Drug Convention.
    Bolivia's coca crop is the third largest in the world, behind Peru 
and Colombia, but the high yield of Bolivian coca makes Bolivia second 
only to

[[Page 252]]
Peru in terms of the production of cocaine alkaloid. The vast 
majority of the coca for cocaine production is cultivated in Bolivia's 
Chapare region. Coca growers produce cocaine base in rudimentary 
laboratories, then sell it to more sophisticated organizations which 
convert cocaine base into cocaine hydrochloride. Bolivia is believed to 
be the world's second leading producer of refined cocaine hydrochloride.
    During 1996, the Government of Bolivia (GOB) eradicated over 7,500 
hectares of coca in the Chapare--the highest level of eradication since 
1990. Despite the GOB's commitment to this program, eradication reduced 
Bolivia's coca crop by only one percent, as new coca cultivation, both 
within and outside of the Chapare, almost offset eradication. Total 
potential cocaine production in 1996 declined by an estimated 10 
percent, however, from 240 metric tons in 1995 to some 215 metric tons 
of cocaine HCl. New coca does not become harvestable--and capable of 
producing the cocaine alkaloid--for two years.
    In order to confront the problem of new planting, the government 
launched late in 1996 an expanded campaign to detect and destroy new 
coca and seedbeds. For the first time, the GOB also fully applied the 
letter of its own law, arresting several peasants for planting new coca.
    The Minister of Justice produced a package of legislative reforms, 
designed to modernize Bolivia's criminal justice sector. Among the 
reforms were strong anti-money laundering provisions. The government 
presented the package to the Bolivian Congress in January 1997, and is 
seeking passage before the June 1997 presidential elections. In 
addition, a new extradition treaty between the United States and 
Bolivia, which allows for the extradition of Bolivian nationals, entered 
into force in November 1996.
    Overall cocaine base and HCl seizures increased in 1996 compared to 
1995, and HCl seizures in the second half of the year increased 
dramatically. The government established a Chemical Control Directorate. 
Meanwhile, an expanded and increasingly effective Chemical Police Unit, 
aided by counterdrug forces in the Chapare, made chemical seizures well 
above 1995 levels. The government's Seized Asset Directorate, created in 
December 1995, began operations, while asset seizures increased by some 
36 percent over 1995.
    In the coming year, the GOB must work to eliminate and prevent new 
coca cultivation, fully applying the Law 1008 prohibition on new 
planting, and reduce coca cultivation in the Chapare by at least 10 
percent. The GOB should press for the passage and rapid implementation 
of a money laundering law along with a revised Code of Criminal 
Procedures. Faced with an increasingly sophisticated group of Bolivian 
trafficking organizations, the GOB's enforcement strategy must more 
effectively target cocaine HCl processing and trafficking organizations, 
as well as Chapare-based cocaine base laboratories. In addition, we 
expect the GOB to ensure that the Blue Devils Riverine Task Force can 
fully exercise its drug enforcement authority and product results 
consistent with its resources.

Brazil

    International narcotics traffickers use Brazil to transship cocaine 
primarily from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to the United States and 
Europe. Brazil serves as an increasingly significant transit route for 
air shipments of cocaine base from Peru to cocaine labs in Colombia. 
Cocaine also transits

[[Page 253]]
the country by river and overland routes. Law 
enforcement agencies estimate that ten to twenty mt of cocaine transit 
Brazil annually, of which Brazilian authorities seized about three mt of 
cocaine in 1996, a decline from last year's almost six mt. Despite the 
decline, Brazil fully cooperated with the USG to advance the goals of 
bilateral agreements and the 1988 UN Drug Convention.
    In 1996, the area of Brazil bordering Peru was heavily used as a 
staging area for air shipments of cocaine destined for the United 
States. Brazilian trafficking organizations reportedly provided fuel and 
airstrips for illicit trafficking purposes.
    To address this threat, Brazilian authorities destroyed several 
airstrips, and commendably repeated operations when traffickers rebuilt 
those cratered airstrips. In a strong commitment to regional 
cooperation, Brazilian police cooperated with Peruvian and Colombian 
police to deter trafficking in the tri-border area between their 
respective countries.
    Focussing on the maritime trafficking problems in Brazil's major 
seaports, which function as conduits for cocaine shipped to the United 
States, Brazil participated in one U.S. Customs port assessment visit to 
the major ports of Rio de Janeiro and nearby Santos. Brazil also 
tightened enforcement over its chemical companies.
    Brazil entered into an agreement with the USG to train police-
prosecutor-judge task forces to bolster the Government of Brazil's (GOB) 
counternarcotics effort and to enhance coordination between judges, 
prosecutors and police. Corruption is a problem in mid and lower levels 
of the DPF that hinders effective enforcement efforts to control drug 
trafficking through Brazil.
    Authorities disrupted the Saavedra-Shapiama Organization, which 
trafficked cocaine from the Amazon region to the United States. With USG 
assistance, Brazilian authorities in good faith continue to investigate 
this and other narcotics trafficking organizations in the Amazon region. 
In May 1996, the Brazilian Senate approved the Amazon Surveillance 
System (SIVAM). SIVAM is a detection and monitoring system that will be 
used to protect the Amazon region, in part against illicit narcotics 
trafficking.
    Although the Brazilian government did not sign a Letter of Agreement 
(LOA) that would have renewed counternarcotics cooperation with the USG 
in 1996, the GOB has demonstrated a strong interest in continuing its 
counternarcotics relationship with the USG. The almost $1 million of 
1996 counternarcotics funding meant for Brazil instead funded the 
Organization of American States Anti-Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/
CICAD). In addition to demonstrating a commitment to cooperate further 
with the USG on counternarcotics, Brazil participated in important 
multilateral counternarcotics initiatives, including an OAS/CICAD 
meeting in Uruguay.
    Other efforts point of Brazil's achievements in 1996. It proposed a 
National Drug Enforcement Plan in 1996. It also hosted several meetings 
of the of the mini-Dublin Group in Brasilia to coordinate 
counternarcotics assistance from major donors, primarily European 
nations. Demand reduction and other multilateral efforts have 
successfully raised the profile of the danger of drug trafficking and 
abuse in Brazil. Although bank secrecy remained a formidable obstacle in 
the battle against money laundering, and


[[Page 254]]
money laundering occurred in 
Brazil's banks and exchange houses, in 1996 the congress initiated 
debate on a bill to counter money laundering.

Cambodia

    In 1996, Cambodia made significant efforts toward addressing drug 
trafficking and transit problems, which the Royal Government of Cambodia 
has acknowledged. There is a significant flow of heroin transiting 
Cambodia which affects the U.S. and other countries. The National 
Assembly passed a comprehensive counternarcotics law on December 3, 
1996. The statute, drafted with UNDCP assistance and advice, includes 
tough anti-money laundering provisions and commits the government to 
becoming a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.
    Other measures taken by the RGC, either separately or in cooperation 
with the U.S. and other governments and international organizations, 
include reorganizing its ill-trained and equipped 900-person National 
Anti-Narcotics Unit into a more effective 40-person National Anti-Drug 
Unit, participating in UNDCP conferences, and seeking other avenues to 
broaden cooperation with surrounding countries and the international 
community. Cambodian drug interdiction efforts resulted in the seizure 
of 40 kilograms of heroin and the arrest of 12 heroin couriers working 
for Nigerian trafficking organizations. The RGC also continued a program 
of marijuana eradication.
    The skeletal nature of Cambodia's law enforcement infrastructure, 
coupled with an impoverished economy, continues to impede efforts as 
assembling comprehensive information about the drug trade in and through 
the country. These weaknesses have also made the task of providing 
appropriate assistance more critical and, at the same time, more 
difficult. The single most important issue Cambodia faces with regard to 
its drug trafficking problem, however, is the issue of drug-related 
corruption. After the publication in 1995 of allegations tying key 
political and business figures to the drug trade, the RGC publicly 
called for information which would aid in the prosecution of any such 
person. There have, however, been no results yet reported in connection 
with these charges. The U.S. will be looking for efforts to deal 
vigorously with drug-related corruption, which would otherwise 
eventually undermine Cambodia's credibility on the issue of narcotics 
control. USG efforts to assist Cambodia in building stronger law 
enforcement and judicial institutions are based on the premise that the 
upper levels of the RGC will thus have available the appropriate means 
for dealing with the issue.

China

    China continues to play a key role as a major transit route for 
Southeast Asian heroin destined for the U.S. and other Western markets. 
Addiction and violent crime associated with China's proximity to the 
Golden Triangle and its flow of narcotics continue to engage the 
attention of Chinese authorities. In April 1996, China's Ministry of 
Public Security began a nationwide anti-crime campaign called ``Strike 
Hard,'' which placed special emphasis on drug interdiction efforts: 
opium seizures in the first ten months of 1996 were up 26 percent over 
all of 1995, and heroin seizures in the first ten months of 1996 were up 
47 percent over the entire amount seized in 1995. China continues to be 
an active participant in the United Nations Drug Control Program and in 
1996 signed mutual legal assistance treaties, 

[[Page 255]]

with specific attention to 
narcotics trafficking, with Russia, Mexico and Pakistan. It is also a 
party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.
    Counternarcotics and law enforcement cooperation with the United 
States continues to be uneven, although senior U.S. and Chinese 
officials have publicly recognized the common interest in enhanced 
cooperation. Lower level officials continue to express a desire to 
expand cooperation, and working-level dialogue and information sharing 
have improved and expanded in some respects. Chinese officials 
participated in a two-week regional cooperation seminar in Bangkok 
conducted by DEA and in a program to help law enforcement officials 
detect and prevent illegal transshipments of precursor chemicals. U.S. 
Customs representatives also taught interdiction techniques to Chinese 
officials in Sichuan Province. But China in 1996 also denied, ``for 
now,'' a USG request to be allowed to open a joint DEA/FBI office at the 
U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
    China's continued strong stand against crime and official corruption 
has been widely publicized. Chinese leaders and law enforcement 
authorities have recognized that rapid economic growth has contributed 
to the spread of corruption, including among lower level officials. 
Penalties for such transgressions are severe and include execution.
    China is a major chemical producer. The interest PRC officials have 
shown in techniques for controlling sales and shipments of chemical 
precursors indicates growing recognition of China's role as a target for 
criminals seeking to illegally procure or divert such chemicals. China's 
recognition of its susceptibility to money laundering also appears to be 
growing, but domestic mechanisms for assessing and addressing the 
problem are only beginning to catch up to the challenge.

Dominican Republic

    In 1996, the Dominican Republic's attention was focused on election 
year politics. As a result, although the out-going government cooperated 
with counternarcotics operations, it has left the new administration 
with unresolved, long-term narcotics-related issues and an environment 
of public concern about corruption. Despite the absence of a master 
plan, the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) remains deeply 
committed to the war against narcotics trafficking and consumption.
    Following its installation in August 1996, the Fernandez 
administration made an anti-corruption agenda and judicial reform high 
priorities of the GODR. However, the GODR lacks effective enforcement 
mechanisms to eliminate the corruption which undermines the country's 
fragile democratic institutions. Additionally, the country's largely 
unpatrolled coast, its porous border with Haiti, and poorly paid and 
under-equipped police and military make it attractive to Dominican and 
Colombian drug transshipment organizations and domestic drug 
traffickers. The majority of Dominicans condemn the use of illegal drugs 
and support GODR efforts to combat narcotics trafficking; drug 
consumption levels are considered low.
    The Government of the Dominican Republic cooperated fully with the 
United States Government on counternarcotics objectives and goals. Among 
the GODR's accomplishments was the arrest of the Cali cartel's Rolando 
Florian-Feliz, the DR's most wanted narcotics trafficker.

[[Page 256]]

    Due to the absence of effective government supervision of exchange 
houses or remittance operations and the presence of large cash flows 
which could hide money laundering activity, it is believed that 
narcotics money continues to be laundered in the Dominican Republic. 
Money laundering is not likely to diminish until the GODR aggressively 
implements the money laundering legislation. Many Dominicans who have 
committed serious crimes in the United States continue to find refuge in 
the Dominican Republic, since local law bars extradition of nationals. 
While 1996 negotiations for a new extradition treaty with the former 
government did not reach a successful conclusion, the USG is currently 
assessing a resumption of talks with the Fernandez administration.
    Neither the GODR itself nor senior government officials encourage, 
facilitate, or engage in drug trafficking or money laundering as a 
matter of government policy. No evidence exists that senior government 
officials are involved in drug distribution or money laundering. No 
senior government official has been indicted for drug-related corruption 
in 1996.

Ecuador

    International narcotics traffickers from Colombia and Peru 
intensified their efforts to transship cocaine and coca base through 
Ecuador. Trafficking organizations ship about 20-40 metric tons (mt) of 
coca base from Peru through Ecuador to Colombia for refining into 
finished cocaine, and about 30-50 mt of cocaine through Ecuador to the 
United States and Europe. Ecuador seized almost nine mt of cocaine in 
1996.
    Traffickers continued to transship cocaine overland and by river, 
and to smuggle chemicals into Ecuador via the Pan American Highway and 
Ecuador's extensive river network, sometimes committing armed robberies 
of truck drivers transporting chemicals from petroleum companies in 
Ecuador's jungle region.
    Ecuadoran authorities responded commendably to counter traffickers, 
placing emphasis on Guayaquil as a favored cocaine transshipment point. 
Authorities made a nearly seven mt seizure of cocaine from a fishing 
vessel, the Don Celso, and had it returned from international waters to 
search it in Guayaquil. Traffickers had loaded the cocaine into the fuel 
tanks of the 150-ft. fishing vessel.
    The Ecuador National Policy (ENP), with USG assistance, identified a 
major cocaine processing facility just west of Quito in a town called 
Santo Domingo de los Colorados. Authorities dismantled the lab, but many 
said it demonstrated a shift in trafficker activity from neighboring 
countries to Ecuador.
    The Government of Ecuador (GOE) demonstrated its commitment to 
regional counternarcotics cooperation efforts. In an unprecedented law 
enforcement cooperation effort with Peru, Ecuadoran police deported to 
Peru Willer Alvarado Linares, a.k.a. ``Champa,'' a Peruvian drug kingpin 
with close ties to the Cali Cartel. With USG assistance, the ENP 
dismantled a major drug trafficking organization in Ecuador reportedly 
run by a Cali-connected trafficker, Jose Castrillon Henao. Ecuadoran 
authorities continued the prosecution of Jorge Hugo Reyes Torres, a 
jailed drug kingpin, also tied to Cali.

[[Page 257]]

    Although police-military cooperation, maritime cooperation, and 
inadequate money laundering legislation remained problems, GOE officials 
made a good faith effort to resolve these issues. The GOE participated 
in drug enforcement and customs training courses, continued some 
information-sharing efforts, and attended a money laundering seminar.
    The Ecuadoran Supreme Court entered into an agreement with the USG 
on administration of justice. The USG bought five computers and a laser 
printer in support of Ecuador's ambitious judicial reform effort. 
Allegations of corruption in the judiciary and in other branches of the 
government plagued the former Bacaram administration, and now plague the 
current administration of interim President Alarcon, hindering effective 
counternarcotics efforts.
    Despite these problems, Ecuadoran government officials demonstrate 
continued interest in working with the USG to address more effectively 
narcotics trafficking problems that threaten to erode democratic 
institutions. Ecuador is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and has 
bilateral agreements with the USG. Ecuador has fully cooperated with the 
USG to advance the goals and objectives of these agreements.

Guatemala

    Despite the political distractions of the ongoing peace process, 
Guatemala continued to cooperate fully with U.S. counternarcotics goals 
and objectives. Law enforcement cooperation between Guatemala and the 
United States has been excellent. With USG support, Guatemalan 
government (GOG) counternarcotics officials seized almost four metric 
tons of cocaine, a significant increase over previous years.
    GOG experts estimate that at least one out of four Guatemalan adults 
suffers from some sort of chemical dependency, principally alcohol 
abuse. Illicit drug use has not been effectively documented, but GOG 
officials believe it has increased steadily since 1990 and contributes 
to the extremely high level of violence in the country, especially in 
the capital city.
    The Department of Anti-Narcotics Operations (DOAN), the country's 
principal counternarcotics organization, fully cooperated with USG 
agencies on information-sharing, joint operations, and special 
investigations targeting international drug trafficking networks. Also 
in 1996, a major corruption ring centered on customs tax evasion and 
extortion was uncovered, giving the GOG further impetus to criminalize 
money laundering and develop the capability to investigate suspect 
financial transactions.
    Recent information indicates that significant quantities of 
precursor chemicals, mostly ephedrine, are being diverted through 
Guatemala to Mexico and the United States. The government has not yet 
taken steps to halt that traffic, which is not currently illegal in 
Guatemala. The GOG has, however, requested and will receive USG 
technical assistance on how to combat this illicit trafficking. In early 
1997, Guatemala hosted a regional seminar to address the problem of the 
control and regulation of precursor chemicals.
    The GOG does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or 
facilitate illicit production or distribution of narcotic or 
psychotropic drugs or controlled substances, or the laundering of 
proceeds from illegal drug transactions. In addition, no senior 
government official facilitates or encourages 

[[Page 258]]

the illicit production or 
distribution of such drugs or substances or the laundering of proceeds 
from illegal drug transactions.
Haiti

    Haiti continues to cooperate with U.S. counternarcotics goals and 
objectives. The Government of Haiti (GOH) confronts a staggering array 
of issues that compete for the attention of its already stretched 
professional and managerial talent and consequently impedes rapid 
progress on counternarcotics issues. Despite these obstacles, the GOH 
made definite progress in counternarcotics issues in 1996.
    The GOH began to reform its existing narcotics laws and to develop a 
national narcotics plan and money laundering legislation. With USG 
support, a Haitian Coast Guard (HCG) unit was established; a 
Counternarcotics Unit (CNU) was trained; and new chiefs for both units 
were installed. The changeover in leadership of the CNU proved 
particularly time-consuming and, despite sincere efforts, the CNU was 
not functioning in its permanent quarters at the airport by the end of 
1996. Nevertheless, the commitment of the Haitian National Police (HNP) 
leadership to maintain high standards of performance within these two 
units is notable.
    The HCG began operating in August 1996 and scored two major cocaine 
seizures amounting to 938 kgs. in its first two months of operation. The 
interdiction and maritime boarding experience in these two operations 
represented a training opportunity that contributed to the HCG's ability 
to eventually conduct independent operations.
    The USG has made a strong commitment to assist Haiti in establishing 
stable democratic institutions. As a part of this effort, the USG 
intends to work with the GOH towards conclusion of a bilateral maritime 
agreement, and to continue its efforts to assist the GOH with its 
narcotics-related agenda and legal reform programs. The USG will also 
assist the HNP in establishing regional law enforcement contacts and 
continue to provide support for both the HCG and the CNU.
    In 1996, the GOH continued to give USG officials high-level 
assurances of its commitment to drug control, and those assurances have 
been supported by concrete progress in establishing Haitian counter-drug 
institutions. However, Haiti still has a number of major goals to 
achieve before it will be able to take significant, independent action 
in counternarcotics.

Hong Kong

    Hong Kong's role as a money laundering base for the international 
drug trade continues to grow, while its role as a transit point for 
drugs appears to have lessened. There were no drug seizures in the 
United States in the first 10 months of 1996 unequivocally linking Hong 
Kong to the U.S. as a transit point for drugs. The overall pattern of 
drug trafficking in the region, however, continues to point to Hong Kong 
as a key transshipment point for drugs destined for the U.S. and other 
Western markets.
    Hong Kong authorities continued to strengthen the legislative 
framework for combatting narcotics trafficking. They extended licensing 
controls to an additional 21 precursor chemicals, introduced 
implementing legislation for bilateral extradition agreements and 
proposed legislation establishing heavier sentences for drug traffickers 
who target the young. On December 20, 1996, the U.S. and Hong Kong 
signed an agreement for the surrender of fu-

gitive offenders (an 
extradition agreement) and the two sides have initialled a Mutual Legal 
Assistance Agreement that will expand the basis for mutual legal 
assistance over a wide range of criminal activity, including that 
currently covered by a Bilateral Narcotics Agreement, which will be 
terminated by its terms on June 30, 1997.
    Hong Kong's mature and experienced law enforcement structure is 
characterized by dedication and no reported narcotics-related corruption 
among senior officials. Cooperation between the United States and Hong 
Kong on matters relating to drug trafficking and money laundering 
continues to be excellent.

India

    India is the sole producer of licit opium gum for the pharmaceutical 
industry, a significant cultivator of opium poppies in remote regions of 
northwest and northeast India and a transit country for opiates from 
both Southwest and Southeast Asia. Controls over the licit opium 
industry have been continuously tightened for the past five years but, 
due to the method of production, some diversion probably continues. The 
well-developed transportation infrastructure in India, combined with 
porous borders from neighboring source countries, has made India an 
attractive transit country for traffickers.
    As a licit producer of opium, India must meet an additional 
certification requirement. In accordance with Section 490(c) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act, it must maintain licit production and stockpiles 
at levels no higher than those consistent with licit market demand and 
take adequate steps to prevent significant diversion of its licit 
cultivation and production into illicit markets and to prevent illicit 
cultivation and production.
    In 1996, India continued to take steps to curtail diversion of licit 
opium, which remains a concern. The minimum qualifying yield (MQY) for 
relicensing to cultivate opium poppy was raised from 46 to 48 kilograms 
per hectare in most growing areas, and offenses related to cultivation 
and embezzlement of opium are now on par with other trafficking crimes. 
Sentences of up to 20 years' imprisonment can be imposed.
    Although the Government of India (GOI) did not agree to direct USG 
participation in the 1996 opium yield survey, it did allow U.S. 
scientists to observe the survey and to work with Indian scientists to 
include new parameters in future opium yield surveys. A comprehensive 
opium yield survey verifies data on crop yields, establishes practicable 
levels of MQY, and better quantifies diversion.
    Indian opium gum, a principal source of the baine and other 
alkaloids essential to certain pharmaceuticals, is in demand by U.S. and 
other pharmaceutical firms. India once again increased opium poppy 
cultivation because of the pharmaceutical demand and a desire to 
establish once again a stockpile against a crop disaster. Opium 
production rose to 849 mt in 1996 from 833 mt in 1995 (all measures at 
ten percent moisture).
    India has illicit opium poppy cultivation, primarily in areas such 
as Jammu and Kashmir, where GOI control is challenged by insurgent 
groups. USG remote sensing in 1996 indicated illicit cultivation on 
3,400 hectares, with a theoretical yield of 47 metric tons of opium, a 
decrease from the previous year's estimate. However, despite efforts by 
the GOI based on sus-

[[Page 260]]

pect coordinates provided by the USG, it was able to 
find only small areas of poppy cultivation.
    The GOI continues to make progress in controlling the production and 
export of precursor chemicals. The GOI has a cooperative relationship 
with the DEA, especially on precursor chemical issues, and has agreed 
not to allow any shipment unless DEA issues a letter of non-objection. 
Trafficking in illegally produced methaqualone (mandrax), a popular drug 
in Africa, is still believed to be a major problem, although seizures 
fell in 1996.
    Authorities have had limited success in prosecuting major narcotics 
trafficking organizations because of the lack of enforcement funding and 
weaknesses in the investigations infrastructure. The GOI stresses 
cooperation among law enforcement entities. India cooperates in 
``controlled deliveries'' that have resulted in arrests in six 
countries.
    The USG receives reports of narcotics-linked corruption, but cannot 
independently verify the extent. No senior-level politician or 
bureaucrat has been accused of narcotics-related corruption.
    India is party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and Indian officials 
state that it is drafting legislation needed on asset seizures and money 
laundering. In the meantime, its law enforcement agencies are without 
the tools to achieve fully the Convention's goals and objectives.
    India fulfilled the requirements of FAA Section 490(c) to maintain 
licit production and stockpiles at levels no higher than consistent with 
market demand. It also continued to take steps to reduce diversion from 
the licit crop, although not agreeing to use a crop yield survey as the 
basis for setting the minimum qualifying yield for license renewal. The 
GOI, upon receipt of information on suspected illicit crops, acted 
promptly to seek out and destroy the plots. For 1996, India's efforts 
meet the additional certification requirements of FAA Section 490(c). 
The United States continues to work with the GOI in the following areas: 
taking effective action against major narcotics trafficking syndicates 
and kingpins; implementing effective measures on money laundering and 
asset seizure; permitting U.S. participation in opium crop surveys; and 
eradicating illicit poppy cultivation.

Jamaica

    Jamaica produces marijuana and is a significant cocaine transit 
country. The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) made some progress during 1996 
to achieve the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to 
which it became a party in December 1995. In December 1996, the Jamaican 
parliament passed a money laundering law, which, although somewhat 
limited in scope in that it criminalizes only the laundering of the 
proceeds of drug-related crime, is the beginning of a money laundering 
control regime. Although the GOJ has yet to prosecute asset forfeiture 
cases under the relevant 1994 act, it did establish a special unit which 
is currently investigating two such cases. Action on drafting a 
precursor chemical bill was deferred to 1997. GOJ-USG negotiations on a 
maritime counternarcotics cooperation agreement, which commenced in 
1996, had been impeded by Jamaica's declaration of exclusive law 
enforcement authority in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In December 
1996, the GOJ withdrew its EEZ declaration, and negotiations resumed in 
February 1997, in a spirit of cooperation and willingness to conclude an 
agreement. Although the rate of extraditions declined markedly, from six 
in 1995 to one (under a waiver of ex-

[[Page 261]]

tradition) in 1996, partly 
attributable to new Jamaican legal procedures regarding appeals, the GOJ 
expelled or deported to the U.S. eight U.S.-citizen fugitives during 
1996. However, a sizeable number of extradition requests to the GOJ 
remain open.
    According to DEA, Jamaican police counternarcotics cooperation in 
1996 remained at the high levels of 1995, but drug arrests, cocaine 
seizures, and cannabis eradication fell somewhat below the goals and 
objectives of our bilateral letter of agreement (LOA). Signed by the GOJ 
and USG, the 1996 LOA set an objective of significantly increasing drug 
arrests and cocaine and heroin seizures. Drug-related arrests in 1996 
(3,263) were down slightly from the 1995 level (3,705). Cocaine seizures 
in 1996 (236 kg) were also reduced from the 1995 level (571 kg). Heroin 
seizures increased slightly in 1996 (1 kg) compared to 1995 (zero kg). 
Marijuana seizures, on the other hand, increased significantly (52.99 mt 
in 1996, compared to 37.20 mt in 1995), bolstered by one very large 
seizure late in 1996. The 1996 LOA set an eradication goal of 800 
hectares of cannabis. During 1996, 473 hectares were eradicated, 
compared to 695 hectares in 1995, with the area under cultivation 
estimated to be the same both years. U.S.-provided helicopters used to 
assist eradication efforts were grounded for safety reasons for part of 
the year.
    Jamaica's National Council on Drug Abuse (NCDA) continued its demand 
reduction efforts, becoming increasingly self-reliant and prominent. 
Jamaica's national drug control strategy has been drafted and is 
awaiting government approval for implementation. The GOJ has not 
formally charged any senior government official with drug-related 
activity, but several Jamaican policemen and court employees have been 
arrested and charged on drug and drug-related charges. The Jamaican 
media continues to report allegations of drug-related corruption among 
public officials including the police.
    In 1997, in order to fully carry out the goals and objectives of the 
1988 UN Drug Convention, the GOJ needs to strengthen its money 
laundering control law, pass a chemical control law, and continue to 
modernize its full range of drug control laws and penalties. Jamaica's 
greatest challenge will be decisive implementation of such laws. The GOJ 
also needs to conclude a maritime cooperation agreement, intensify its 
effort to respond to U.S. extradition requests, prosecute asset 
forfeiture cases, and increases the conviction rate of those arrested 
for drug-related crimes. On the bilateral level, in order to make better 
use of U.S. counter-drug and anti-crime assistance, Jamaica needs to 
intensify its drug law enforcement and marijuana eradication efforts, 
tighten the security of its export shipments to keep drugs out of them, 
and participate fully in combined maritime counterdrug operations. In 
addition, the GOJ needs to formally approve its national drug control 
strategy and systematically implement it. The GOJ should take decisive 
measures to root out drug-related corruption among public officials 
which undermines drug control efforts.

Laos

    Laos is still a distant third, after Burma and Afghanistan, in world 
production of illicit opium. The 1995/96 growing cycle saw an estimated 
increase of 11% in opium production over the 1994/95 level; this was a 
little over 50% of the record level set in 1989. Regions of Laos covered 
by USG- and UNDCP-funded crop substitution projects, however, saw only 
low levels of poppy cultivation. In May, the Lao Government passed an amend-

[[Page 262]]

ment to its existing drug control law which banned opium production 
and increased penalties for trafficking. It believes, however, that 
rigorous enforcement of the provision outlawing opium production 
requires adequate programs to provide alternative sources of income to 
farmers and continues to press its case for adequate assistance from the 
international community to enable it to fully implement its anti-
narcotics action plan.
    Reservations about its ability to enforce the legislation banning 
opium production notwithstanding, the Government of Laos continued to 
participate actively in regional counternarcotics efforts. It signed a 
UNDCP-sponsored project document on regional law enforcement cooperation 
and hosted a regional working level conference on the trafficking of 
precursor chemicals and the involvement of West African drug traffickers 
in Southeast Asia. Bilateral cooperation with the United States, 
however, remained at the center of Laos' counternarcotics endeavors. USG 
funding of the Houaphan crop control project continued, and the Lao 
formed two additional Special Counternarcotics Units, one in Savannakhet 
and one in Bokeo, with USG assistance. In November, the Lao Government 
approved the assignment of a DEA representative to the American Embassy 
in Vientiane. Overall Lao cooperation with the USG on counternarcotics 
matters remains excellent; while low-level corruption is assumed to 
exist, there is little to indicate high-level or systematic drug-related 
corruption in the Lao government. Laos' vigorous enforcement over the 
coming year of its newly enacted laws outlawing opium production and 
increasing the penalties for drug trafficking will be an important 
signal of its long-term commitment to controlling its drug problem.

Malaysia

    Malaysia is a transit country for heroin bound for the U.S., Europe 
and other destinations. Malaysia's anti-trafficking laws include a 
mandatory death sentence for convicted traffickers. Law enforcement 
authorities are pressing for enactment of a conspiracy law to enable 
prosecution of traffickers who escape prosecution under existing 
criminal statutes. In addition, the Government of Malaysia has 
instituted a number of bureaucratic measures, including the 
establishment of a new interagency group headed by the Prime Minister, 
to bolster enforcement and demand reduction activities. Malaysia is also 
a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.
    Cooperation between Malaysian law enforcement officials and DEA 
continued to expand in 1996. Negotiation of a bilateral Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty between Malaysia and the U.S. is proceeding smoothly. 
Both governments hope to conclude the treaty in 1997. Malaysia and the 
United States also cooperated on drug abuse prevention (demand 
reduction) programs, many of them directed at rehabilitation center 
inmates. These programs are of particular concern to the Malaysian 
Government in view of rising addiction rates. Existing rehabilitation 
centers have also been a focal point of the lower-level narcotics-
related corruption which is known to exist: guard and treatment center 
employees have sold narcotics to inmates. The Malaysian Government has 
proposed an amendment to the Dangerous Drugs Act to strengthen the 
penalty for such activities.
    Malaysia is also beginning to look toward money laundering as a 
vulnerable point in its overall legal and institutional structure. 
Senior government officials have publicly expressed concern about 
possible misuse of Malaysia's offshore financial center, Labuan, to 
launder money. Malaysia has now 

[[Page 263]]

endorsed the Commonwealth Secretariat's 
efforts to produce model anti-money laundering legislation.

Mexico

    The Government of Mexico's (GOM) 1996 counter-drug effort produced 
encouraging results and notable progress in bilateral cooperation. 
President Zedillo has declared the major drug trafficking organizations, 
and the corruption they foster within governmental structures, to be 
Mexico's principal national security threat. He has intensified the 
country's counter-drug effort, in keeping with international human 
rights norms, both through legal reforms and operationally, through the 
expanded participation of the nation's military services.
    Drug seizures and arrests increased in 1996. Mexican authorities 
seized 23.8 mt of cocaine, 383 kgs of heroin, 1015 mt of marijuana, 
171.7 kgs of methamphetamine and 6.7 mt of ephedrine (its chemical 
precursor), and destroyed 20 drug labs. Police arrested 11,283 suspects 
on drug-related charges. Authorities arrested a several major 
traffickers: Juan Garcia Abrego, Gulf cartel leader and one of the FBI's 
``Ten Most Wanted'' fugitive; Jose Luis Pereira Salas, linked to the 
Cali and Juarez cartels; and Manuel Rodriguez Lopez, linked to the 
Castrillon maritime smuggling organization.
    The Mexican Congress passed two critical pieces of legislation which 
have armed the GOM with a whole new arsenal of weapons to use to combat 
money laundering, chemical diversion and organized crime. The GOM 
established organized crime task forces in key locations in northern and 
western Mexico in cooperation with U.S. law enforcement. In an effort to 
confront widespread corruption within the nation's law enforcement 
agencies, former Attorney General Lozano dismissed over 1250 federal 
police officers and technical personnel for corruption or incompetence, 
although some have been rehired, and the GOM indicted two former senior 
GOM officials and a current Undersecretary of Tourism. He also sought to 
expand cooperation with the United States and other governments.
    The United States and Mexico established the High-Level Contact 
Group on Narcotics Control (HLCG) to explore joint solutions to the 
shared drug threat and to coordinate bilateral anti-drug efforts. The 
HLCG met three times during 1996 and its technical working groups met 
throughout the year. Under the aegis of the HLCG, the two governments 
developed a joint assessment of the narcotics threat posed to both 
countries which will be used as the basis for a joint counter-drug 
strategy.
    U.S.-Mexican bilateral cooperation on drug law enforcement continued 
to improve in 1996, particularly in the areas of money laundering, 
mutual legal assistance, and criminal investigations. The USG provided 
training, technical, and material support to personnel of the Office of 
the Mexican Attorney General (PGR), the National Institute to Combat 
Drugs (INCD), the Mexican Treasury, and the Mexican armed forces. The 
Government of Mexico established the important precedent of extraditing 
Mexican nationals to the United States under the provision of Mexico's 
extradition law permitting this in ``exceptional circumstances.'' This 
paves the way for further advances in bringing fugitives to justice. 
Both governments returned record numbers of fugitives in 1996.
    Even with positive results, and good cooperation with the U.S. and 
other governments, the problems which Mexico faces remain daunting. The 

[[Page 264]]

Zedillo Administration has taken important beginning steps against the 
major drug cartels in Mexico, and towards more effective cooperation 
with the United States and other international partners, but the 
strongest groups, such as the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, have yet to be 
effectively confronted. The level of narcotics corruption is very 
serious, reaching into the very senior levels of Mexico's drug law 
enforcement forces, as witnessed by the February 1997 arrest of the 
recently-appointed national counternarcotics coordinator. President 
Zedillo acted courageously to remove him as soon as the internal Mexican 
investigation revealed the problem, but this has been a set-back for 
Mexico's anti-drug effort, and for bilateral cooperation.
    Mexican police, military personnel, prosecutors, and the courts need 
additional resources, training and other support to perform the 
important and dangerous tasks ahead of them. Progress in establishing 
controls on money laundering and chemical diversion must be further 
enhanced and implemented. New capabilities need to be institutionalized. 
Above all, the GOM will have to take system-wide action against 
corruption and other abuses of official authority through enhanced 
screening personnel in sensitive positions and putting into place 
ongoing integrity controls.
    While there are still serious problems, and a number of areas in 
which the USG would like to see further progress, the two governments 
have agreed on the parameters of a joint approach to combat the 
narcotics threat, and are at work on developing this strategy. The drug 
issue will remain one of the top issues in the bilateral agenda and will 
be one of the main issues discussed during President Clinton's planned 
visit to Mexico in April.

Panama

    Panama continued to cooperate with the United States to achieve our 
counternarcotics goals and objectives in 1996. The Government of 
Panama's (GOP) achievements in 1996 included an eradication campaign 
which resulted in the elimination of the country's fledgling coca 
cultivation and significant damage to marijuana cultivation, aggressive 
and effective prevention and education campaigns, and the first-ever 
conviction of a major money launderer from the Colon Free Zone. In one 
of the region's most significant arrests, the GOP captured the Cali 
cartel's primary maritime smuggler, Jose Castrillon Henao, who is 
scheduled for trial in 1997. The USG provided six helicopters to the GOP 
in late 1996, for the express purpose of combatting narcotics.
    Following up on full congressional certification for the past two 
years, and spurred on by last year's legislation tightening money 
laundering regulations, the Government of Panama made Latin America's 
first financial analysis unit operational, resulting in the presentation 
of patterns of money laundering to the GOP's National Security Council 
for eventual prosecution.
    Panama continues to be a major financial and commercial center 
ideally positioned for narcotics smuggling and illicit financial 
transactions. Money laundering remains the primary problem in Panama. 
Local factors facilitating money laundering include bank secrecy, the 
Colon Free Zone, inadequate controls on cash and commodity imports/
exports, lax incorporation regulations, and a dollar-based economy. The 
GOP has taken definite steps to address these problems, including the 
start-up of a financial analysis 

[[Page 265]]

unit and the establishment of 
computerized data bases for tracking financial movements in the Colon 
Free Zone. The GOP also established a financial investigative unit which 
will prepare cases of money laundering for prosecution. Armed with more 
effective legal, policy, and institutional underpinnings, the GOP 
expects to counter money laundering activities more successfully in 
1997.
    The GOP needs to continue to crack down on both money laundering and 
drug trafficking, follow through on reports of suspicious transactions 
by arresting and convicting major money launderers, improve interdiction 
capabilities, and make effective use of the financial analysis unit.

Paraguay

    The government of Juan Carlos Wasmosy cooperated fully with the 
United States in 1996. Government of Paraguay (GOP) anti-drug efforts 
improved substantially, and the government took adequate measures to 
further its compliance with the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention. Scarce resources, public corruption, and an only partially-
reformed legal system remain obstacles to more effective 
counternarcotics action, but the GOP has demonstrated its commitment to 
combatting the drug trade.
    President Wasmosy appointed an activist Director to the National 
Anti-drug Executive Secretariat (SENAD) in June, who immediately sought 
a closer, more productive relationship with the United States and with 
Paraguay's neighbors. Assuming the post with a reputation for honesty, 
Carlos Ayala made cocaine trafficking groups the SENAD's top priority. 
He has removed anti-drug officers implicated in corrupt practices, and 
focused Paraguay's investigative resources on Paraguay's top 
traffickers. Under Ayala's leadership, SENAD developed a comprehensive 
national anti-drug strategy, which President Wasmosy presented to the 
nation in late fall. Ayala also launched a new approach to combat drug 
abuse.
    The Paraguayan Congress, with strong support from the executive 
branch, in December enacted an anti-money laundering law consistent with 
international standards. SENAD Chief Ayala initiated a revision of 
Paraguay's anti-narcotics statute which would explicitly authorize 
undercover operations and controlled deliveries. The GOP is pushing for 
congressional approval of the amendment early in 1997.
    The SENAD continued large-scale marijuana eradication operations, 
worked closely with DEA on training and equipping the Anti-narcotics 
Police (DINAR) Special Intelligence and Investigative Unit, and assessed 
the threat of precursor chemical trafficking and diversion in Paraguay. 
Meanwhile, on the international front, the GOP signed agreements with 
Brazil and Argentina to cooperate in combatting trans-border criminal 
activity, including drug trafficking, and Paraguayan officials initiated 
working-level coordination meetings with counterparts in these 
countries. The SENAD also agreed with Bolivian counterparts to share 
intelligence and to conduct joint operations.
    In 1997, the GOP should secure passage of a strengthened anti-drug 
law and begin to forcefully implement its new money laundering statute. 
The USG will assist the GOP in creating an interagency financial crimes 
investigative unit. Paraguay also must improve its ability to 
investigate drug and other organized crime groups in the tri-border 
area, particularly in the cit-

[[Page 266]]

ies of Pedro Juan Caballero and Ciudad del 
Este, and we expect the GOP to pursue key drug trafficking and 
corruption cases in the coming year.

Peru

    Peru is the world's largest coca producer. The USG has consistently 
urged the Government of Peru (GOP) to fulfill its signatory obligations 
under the 1961 Single Convention and the 1988 UN Drug Convention, 
particularly with regard to reducing its coca production. In 1996, the 
GOP cooperated fully with the United States in efforts to achieve the 
goals and objectives of the UN drug conventions. Last year, total coca 
cultivation decreased by 18 percent, from 115,300 hectares in 1995 to 
94,400 hectares in 1996. The level of cultivation in Peru was the lowest 
since 1986.
    Contributing to the reduction was widespread abandonment of coca 
fields by farmers due to depressed cocaine base prices. Cocaine base 
prices were held below the break-even point by Peruvian National Police 
and Peruvian Air Force actions against the narcotics trafficking 
transportation infrastructure. During 1996, the joint USG-GOP 
alternative development program established a foothold to begin economic 
restructuring in coca cultivating areas. Some 226 communities signed 
agreements to reduce illicit coca cultivation by approximately 15,000 
hectares over the next five years, in exchange for assistance to 
increase productivity and income from licit alternative crops.
    Peruvian National Police operations seized greater amounts of 
cocaine base and coca leaf, but less cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) than in 
1995. Efforts to arrest and prosecute major Peruvian traffickers 
maintained the GOP's stiff narcotics policy, and contributed to disarray 
among major trafficking organizations. Still, there was strong evidence 
that Peruvian traffickers continued to refine cocaine hydrochloride and 
ship it directly to Mexico for distribution in the United States. 
President Fujimori continued to take a tough public stance against 
narcotics corruption, and in 1996 created a special drug court system to 
handle drug offenses. The U.S. Embassy reported that incidents of 
military and police drug corruption were quickly addressed by the GOP.
    In April 1996, the GOP passed Law 824, which established a civilian 
drug council (CONTRADROGAS). CONTRADROGAS was created to coordinate the 
efforts of the various GOP agencies involved in counternarcotics 
efforts, and to implement the Peruvian National Drug Strategy announced 
in 1994.
    In 1997, the GOP must mount an aggressive effort to attract 
additional donor funding to expand alternative development efforts while 
coca farmers are still receptive to licit economic alternatives. The GOP 
must also ensure that the narcotics law enforcement effort which has 
suppressed cocaine base prices is intensified to address riverborne 
narcotics traffic and sustain the existing aerial intercept effort.

Taiwan

    Taiwan's geographical location relative to the Golden Triangle and 
its importance as an advanced regional transportation and shipping 
center make it a major transit point for drugs destined for the U.S. and 
other markets. Taiwan authorities dispute this assessment, citing 
reduced seizures and arrests as a signal of the deterrent effect of 
their considerable counter-

[[Page 267]]

narcotics efforts. The pattern of trafficking 
in the region, however, suggests that because of its geographic location 
and its ports, Taiwan will remain a target for drug traffickers. Taiwan 
law enforcement authorities, in fact, recently expressed concern that 
Hong Kong-based drug traffickers may be collaborating with Taiwan 
organized crime groups to transfer their base of operations to Taiwan 
before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in July of 1997, and 
their cooperation with the U.S. on counternarcotics efforts continues to 
be good.
    Taiwan's law enforcement cooperation with DEA (under the auspices of 
the American Institute in Taiwan) and other U.S. agencies expanded in 
1996. Taiwan is setting up a new National Drug Intelligence Center; we 
envisage increased cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies 
resulting from this. The American Institute in Taiwan and the Taiwan 
Economic and Cultural Representative Office continue to negotiate a 
Memorandum of Understanding to provide a framework for even broader 
counternarcotics cooperation. Taiwan has been conducting an aggressive 
anti-crime campaign on other fronts, as well, including prosecuting 
cases of public corruption. There are, however, no known cases of 
official involvement in narcotics trafficking.
    In 1996, Taiwan also passed money laundering legislation meant to 
bring it into closer conformity with the goals and objectives of the 
1988 UN Drug Convention. While the law enhances the ability of law 
enforcement officials to deal with the problem, it requires a number of 
revisions to enable Taiwan to meet international standards.

Thailand

    Thailand remains a major transit route for drugs destined for the 
U.S. and other markets and produces about one per cent of Southeast 
Asia's opiates. It continues to serve as a model for the region as a 
result of its successful efforts to control opium production and its 
commitment to prosecuting drug producers and traffickers. Opium 
production in the 1995/96 growing season increased from an estimated 25 
metric tons in the previous season to 30 metric tons. The upsurge in 
opium and heroin prices shortly after the destabilization of Khun Sa's 
trafficking operations in Burma was largely responsible for more 
widespread opium cultivation. Thailand's actions to close off sections 
of the Thai border with Burma, however, had helped create the conditions 
leading to Khun Sa's decision to reach a settlement with the SLORC.
    In January of 1996, Thailand extradited a former Member of 
Parliament to the United States for prosecution on drug trafficking 
charges. Two ``Operation Tiger Trap'' defendants (part of drug lord Khun 
Sa's trafficking operation) were also extradited to the U.S. later in 
the year. Thirteen individuals have been arrested thus far in connection 
with this major ``sweep.''
    Thai cooperation with U.S. law enforcement officials remains 
excellent. Thailand's Office of the Narcotics Control Board and the 
Police Narcotics Suppression Bureau continue to exhibit a high degree of 
professionalism. Corruption continues to be a problem in the Police 
Department, which lacks an effective internal security apparatus to hold 
officers accountable for wrongdoing. Elements of the Royal Thai Army and 
Thai Customs have also been publicly accused of corruption. The Royal 
Thai Government as 

[[Page 268]]

a whole, however, supports a policy of active 
measures against drug production and trafficking.
    Thailand is vulnerable to money laundering. A bill to enact 
legislation has been stalled for a number of years. In late November, 
the newly-elected Prime Minister promised the President that the 
legislation would be given special handling to hasten its passage. 
Passage of appropriate anti-money laundering legislation would enable 
Thailand to become a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.
    Like other countries in the region, Thailand may find itself 
becoming an even larger market for the region's opium, heroin and 
amphetamine production as the region's economic expansion continues. We 
will be urging Thailand to enact a conspiracy law to further enhance its 
ability to mount effective counternarcotics efforts and to establish an 
amplified crop control program.

Venezuela

    Venezuela continued to be a major transit country for cocaine 
shipped from Colombia to the United States, and for chemicals 
transhipped through Venezuelan ports, as well as a money laundering 
center. Law enforcement agencies estimate that between 100-200 metric 
tons (mt) of cocaine are shipped through Venezuela to the United States 
and Europe. The Government of Venezuela (GOV) seized only about six mt 
of cocaine, almost identical to the amount it seized in 1995. Heroin 
seizures declined by 27 percent, from 96 kilograms (kg) in 1995 to 70 kg 
in 1996.
    A significant decision this year was President Caldera's appointment 
of a politically powerful drug czar and elevation of this position to a 
cabinet rank. However, the GOV must produce more concrete 
counternarcotics results to match this demonstration of political will 
during the next year.
    Venezuela's main port, Puerto Cabello, is a favored point for 
illicit smuggling by narcotics trafficking syndicates. The same is true 
of other ports along Venezuela's long coastline. Venezuela's airspace 
offers further opportunities for trafficking. Traffickers transport 
cocaine by small aircraft primarily to Venezuela's border states of 
Tachira and Apure. Traffickers risk little by transporting cocaine 
through Venezuela due to weak and ineffectual law enforcement 
interdiction efforts.
    The United States designated Venezuela as a recipient of more than 
$12 million worth of USG drawdown defense equipment. The Venezuelan 
Armed Forces adopted a counterdrug strategy, which defines its role as 
supporting the National Guard (GN) and police forces. The GOV is working 
with the United States to create a Joint Police/Military 
Counternarcotics Intelligence Center. However, much more needs to be 
done to improve communication and coordination between the GN and the 
Navy, Air Force and Army to implement the strategy.
    Maritime cooperation was disrupted by GOV denials of four USG 
requests from United States Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments from 
third country vessels to board suspected Venezuelan narcotics 
trafficking vessels in international waters. However, USG and GOV 
authorities are currently seeking to broker a maritime agreement.
    Although the GOV lacks effective controls over certain precursor 
chemicals, it made significant seizures of chemicals at Puerto Cabello. 
The GOV 

[[Page 269]]

also continued to make significant progress against illicit 
cultivation. Venezuelan authorities identified replantings of about 500 
hectares (ha) of coca and opium poppy fields in the Sierra de Perija 
region on the border with Colombia. With USG assistance, those 
replantings were eradicated. Since 1994, joint efforts have reduced 
estimated illicit plantings from 1,000 ha to 200 ha.
    The GOV permitted the basing of United States military assets and 
personnel in Venezuela in an effort to cooperate on Operation Laser 
Strike, a United States Southern Command regional air interdiction 
operation.
    Money laundering in Venezuela continued in its financial network of 
banks and non-bank institutions because of weak banking supervision and 
regulatory authority. Although Venezuela passed a drug law in 1993 that 
included provisions on money laundering, key provisions are lacking, 
including one on conspiracy.
    Allegations of corruption plague the judicial branch and some 
elements of the GN. Law enforcement agencies believe that corruption in 
the GN is a problem, hobbling the effectiveness of counternarcotics 
efforts. These shortfalls have raised the USG's concern about 
trafficking through Venezuela to the United States. Venezuela must move 
swiftly to reform its judicial branch, whose corruption threatens to 
prevent Venezuela from combatting its drug problem and from protecting 
its democratic institutions and national territory from international 
drug traffickers.
    Despite such problems, eradication efforts, the elevated rank of the 
drug czar, Venezuela's first national epidemiological survey, and other 
counternarcotics efforts reflect the GOV's spirit of cooperation to 
advance the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention and 
bilateral agreements with the United States. However, the USG will 
scrutinize Venezuela's efforts in the coming year and will expect the 
GOV to be vigorously engaged in increased cooperation on drug 
interdiction, money laundering, chemical control, anti-corruption 
efforts and conclusion of a comprehensive bilateral maritime cooperation 
agreement.

Vietnam

    Vietnam's increased trade and tourism have opened new routes for 
Southeast Asian heroin shipments to such consumer markets as Australia, 
North America and Europe. The SRV continues to battle against narcotics 
trafficking but has yet to overcome problems of corruption within the 
military and police. The SRV does, nonetheless, appear to be actively 
engaged on the counternarcotics issue, conducting a demand reduction 
media campaign as well as police operations and crop eradication 
programs. SRV statistics reflect cultivation of 1800 hectares of opium 
poppy during 1995/96. USG estimates, however, place the cultivation 
level at 3,150 hectares.
    Vietnam created a Drug Control Master Plan in 1995 which calls for 
the eradication of opium cultivation by the year 2000. In October of 
1996, the SRV promulgated implementing regulations for articles of the 
criminal code related to narcotics. The new regulations permit asset 
seizures in narcotics cases. Vietnam joined the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations Drug Control Cooperation Program in 1996. Vietnam has also 
stated that it expects to ratify the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 1997. It 
is currently drafting a comprehensive narcotics control law, based on 
the tenets of the 1988 Convention, which is expected to go before the 
National Assembly in 

[[Page 270]]

1997. The law will include statutes related to the 
control of chemical precursors and provide for controlled shipments as 
an investigative technique.
    SRV interdiction efforts resulted in 6,000 narcotics-related arrests 
in 1996, twice as many as in 1995. SRV law enforcement agencies are 
working with the UNDCP to create special counternarcotics squads across 
the country. U.S.-SRV cooperation on narcotics issues expanded 
throughout 1996. Training initiatives included DEA training for Ministry 
of Interior narcotics control teams in Hanoi and U.S. Customs Service 
training for Vietnamese customs officers in Ho Chi Minh City. Several 
senior Vietnamese narcotics officers also traveled to the United States 
for consultations with U.S. counterparts. The U.S. hopes to increase the 
level of its assistance to Vietnam. To that end, it plans to engage the 
SRV in drafting a Memorandum of Understanding on counternarcotics 
cooperation; a successful outcome, however, will depend to a great 
extent on the SRV's coming to grips with the conditionality involved in 
any expanded U.S. assistance.

VITAL NATIONAL INTERESTS JUSTIFICATIONS
Belize

    Because of a significant increase in the detected activities of 
Colombian drug trafficking organizations in Belize in 1995, Belize was 
added to the list of major drug producing and transit countries for 
1996. Belizean traffickers are also working with Mexican groups to move 
the Colombian cocaine north to the United States. These criminal 
activities continued throughout 1996, but the ability of the Government 
of Belize (GOB) to combat them was severely undermined by deeply-
entrenched corruption, which reaches into senior levels of government.
    The GOB's accomplishments weighed against those areas where progress 
was lacking have led to a decision to consider denial of certification 
of Belize. The GOB's accomplishments in 1996, such as its recent 
accession to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and passage of money laundering 
legislation, were achieved only after the United States and other 
countries exerted intense, coordinated pressure. Belizean cocaine 
seizures were down 36 percent and marijuana eradication decreased by 4 
percent from 1995. Finally, the record of arrests and convictions of 
major drug dealers was, likewise, disappointing. During 1996, the GOB 
took no meaningful steps to uncover or punish official corruption.
    Bungled investigations, along with several high-profile trials 
ending in acquittal, including the prosecution of the Home Minister's 
son-in-law for running an illegal airstrip and two immigration officials 
fired from their jobs and accused of corruption in an alien smuggling 
case, have, at a minimum, demonstrated the GOB's deficiencies in its 
efforts.
    The USG urged the GOB to demonstrate its willingness to cooperate 
with the United States in achieving reasonable counternarcotics goals 
and objectives. The GOB, however, is not fully cooperating or taking 
adequate steps to meet the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, especially promises made by the GOB toward the end of the 
year to complete a new extradition treaty and a mutual legal assistance 
treaty. The GOB has been operating under a US-UK extradition treaty.

[[Page 271]]

    Denial of certification would be contrary to U.S. vital national 
interests because it would require the U.S. to vote against multilateral 
development bank funding for Belize, an important element in supporting 
our long-term democracy and economic development goals for the country. 
Such multilateral support reinforces U.S. counternarcotics assistance 
which is designed to help Belize develop strong, independent and 
credible institutions capable of bringing traffickers to justice, 
stemming the flow of narcotics through the country and better guarding 
its own borders.
    Although Belize's counternarcotics efforts fell short of full 
cooperation during 1996, the GOB did take steps which demonstrated an 
effort to work with the USG. It is in the vital national interests of 
the United States to improve the GOB's counternarcotics efforts and 
ensure that they are given the attention required.

Lebanon

    Lebanon appears to have succeeded in the struggle against illicit 
crop cultivation due to the joint Lebanese-Syrian eradication efforts 
since 1992. There appears to be no cultivation of opium and the cannabis 
cultivation (for hashish production) also has all but disappeared. There 
are some small farms in the Baalbek-Hermel region which are still 
engaged in illicit cultivation, but they appear to be few in number. 
When such farms are discovered, arrests are made immediately and the 
crops are eradicated. Lebanese Internal Security Forces (LISF) and the 
Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), with assistance from the Syrian Army, 
reported eradication of approximately 70,000 square meters of cannabis 
in the Baalbek-Hermel region of the Bekaa Valley during June and July. 
There were no other reported eradication efforts during the year.
    However, Lebanon remains a significant transit country for the 
purposes of re-export of cocaine, and many small ``home''-type labs for 
processing opium into heroin are still reported to operate in the Bekaa 
Valley. Several areas of the Bekaa Valley are not under the effective 
control the Government of Lebanon (GOL), and these areas are vulnerable 
to the establishment of illegal labs.
    Although local authorities deny money laundering is a serious 
problem, Lebanon still presents itself to narcotics traffickers as a 
venue for money laundering due to bank secrecy laws, which do not allow 
for official discovery. Corruption remains endemic through all levels of 
Lebanese society, reportedly including law enforcement bodies.
    In March 1996, the GOL acceded to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, but 
with formal reservations regarding certain provisions of the Convention, 
including those which relate to bank secrecy. The United States has 
already indicated its intention to formally object to these reservations 
if Lebanon does not withdraw them. Parliament is studying a draft anti-
drug code, which would make money laundering a crime.
    The GOL has displayed a willingness to cooperate with USG agencies 
during 1996. Unfortunately, Lebanon's reservations to some of the 
provisions of the 1988 UN Drug Convention suggest that the political 
will is not yet sufficient to comply fully with world standards.
    Lebanese trafficking continues to pose a threat to U.S. citizens and 
interests. On the other hand, the United States considers the provision 
of assist-

[[Page 272]]

ance which encourages the continued development of Lebanon's 
economy and infrastructure as critical to peace and stability in the 
Middle East, which is also of vital importance to U.S. interests and 
stability. These factors, combined with Lebanon's sustained positive 
performance in eradication and other anti-narcotics efforts, outweigh 
the threat posed by drug trafficking through Lebanon to the United 
States.

Pakistan

    Pakistan is an important transit country for opiates from 
Afghanistan, a source country for approximately 75 metric tons of opium, 
and a processing country for domestic opium and opium from Afghanistan. 
Most opium poppy cultivation and most laboratory production of morphine 
base and heroin in Pakistan takes place in the Northwest Frontier 
Province (NWFP), which borders Afghanistan. Pakistan has a bilateral 
agreement with the United States that provides funding for law 
enforcement, roads and crop substitution in the NWFP, and demand 
reduction activities.
    Under the government of Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's counternarcotics 
efforts from January through October 1996 were seriously deficient. 
However, the interim government of Meraj Khalid, which replaced the 
Bhutto government in November, took a number of significant 
counternarcotics actions in accordance with the U.S.-Pakistani bilateral 
agreement and the 1988 UN Drug Convention.
    The primary counternarcotics achievement of the Bhutto government 
was a reduction in the cultivation of opium poppy. USG estimates of land 
used for opium poppy decreased 51 percent to 3,400 hectares and the 
estimate of production decreased 52 percent to 75 metric tons from the 
previous year. The Bhutto government also extradited Sialek Jan, wanted 
by the USG on narcotics trafficking charges in March. However, under 
Bhutto, Pakistani authorities failed to act on DEA information on 
specific cases of trafficking, severely cut the budget of the Pakistani 
Anti Narcotics Force (ANF), failed to act on recommendations of the UN 
Drug Control Programs (UNDCP) for improvements to the Narcotics 
Substances Act, and failed to interdict trafficking caravans in 
Baluchistan Province. During Bhutto's tenure, corruption was a 
significant problem, with ANF officials suspected of perpetrating a hoax 
seizure of opium base in June, and subsequently covering up their 
actions.
    Pakistani President Leghari November 5 dismissed the Bhutto 
government for corruption and mismanagement, an act subsequently upheld 
by the Pakistani Supreme Court. Corruption is a severe and chronic 
problem in the Pakistani government, including the ANF, which has no 
bureaucratic system, such as an internal affairs section for 
identifying, investigating and recommending action against corrupt 
officers. No one in a policy-making position in either the Bhutto or 
interim government has been accused of narcotics-related corruption. 
Sufficient legislation exists to control and punish public corruption 
but it is seldom enforced. The interim government in November initiated 
a comprehensive process for holding public officials accountable for 
corrupt practices.
    The interim government in November and December 1996 promulgated 
changes to the Narcotics Substances Act as suggested by UNDCP, restored 
some funds to the ANF, conducted two major raids on heroin laboratories 
in NWFP, extradited to the United States accused trafficker Nasrullah 

[[Page 273]]

Henjrah, and arrested another individual on the U.S. extradition request 
list, Nasir Ali Khan.
    During the course of the year, the Government of Pakistan froze $3.5 
million in assets from 21 traffickers and seized 5.4 metric tons of 
opium and 2.0 metric tons of heroin. These figures represent declines 
from those of 1995.
    Pakistan is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, which it 
ratified in October 1991, but implementing legislation on money 
laundering has not yet been drafted. The revisions to the Narcotic 
Substances Act approved by the interim government bring asset seizure 
and controlled delivery standards to the levels demanded by the 
Convention.
    Vital U.S. national interests could be damaged if Pakistan, under 
the newly-elected government of Nawaz Sharif, were to be denied 
certification. Pakistan is a moderate Islamic state with a nuclear 
weapons capability. Pakistan is the largest contributor of troops for UN 
peacekeeping operations and has provided key cooperation in the 
international fight against terrorism. Denial of certification would be 
viewed in Pakistan as abandonment of a loyal ally and would endanger 
U.S.-Pakistani dialogue on vital issues. Denial of certification could 
also bring to a halt the counternarcotics momentum started in November 
by the caretaker government, and could negatively prejudice the newly 
elected government against counternarcotics cooperation with the United 
States.
    Denial of certification would further endanger U.S. interests by 
requiring the United States to vote against Pakistan in multilateral 
development banks (MDBs). The United States has an interest in seeing 
that the MDBs continue their support of activities such as the GOP's 
Social Action Program and its Financial Sector Reform Project, which are 
essential to Pakistan's human and economic development. Pakistan is one 
of the largest beneficiaries of World Bank and Asian Development Bank 
programs.
    These risks to vital U.S. interests outweigh any potential gain from 
denying certification to Pakistan. Pakistan is a primary conduit for 
opium and morphine base from Afghanistan, the second largest opium 
producer in the world. With continuing conflict and no central 
government in Afghanistan, Pakistan's cooperation is particularly 
important in stopping Southwest Asian drugs.
    During the period of vital national interests certification, the 
United States will strive to work with senior officials of the new 
government to achieve the goals of the UN Drug Convention.


STATEMENTS OF EXPLANATION
Afghanistan

    Afghanistan is second only to Burma as a producer of illicit opium, 
producing approximately 30 percent of the world illicit supply. 
Production flattened in 1996, after steep annual increases earlier in 
the decade. U.S. satellite surveys indicated a very small decrease in 
both cultivation and production, to 37,950 hectares and 1230 metric 
tons, respectively.

[[Page 274]]

    Civil war not only continued but intensified in Afghanistan during 
1996. Between September and December, the Taliban, a movement started by 
religious students, expanded the territory it controls. The Taliban now 
control 90 percent of the land on which opium poppy is cultivated. The 
Taliban have now controlled the province producing the greatest quantity 
of opium for over two years. Both USG and UN Drug Control Program 
(UNDCP) surveys indicate that there were no concerted eradication 
efforts in 1996.
    Law enforcement actions were virtually non-existent. None of the 
factions controlling territory made a serious attempt to disrupt 
narcotics trafficking. Granted that none of the factions has an 
effective law enforcement bureaucracy, the ease with which narcotics 
caravans and refineries continued open operations was nevertheless 
remarkable. In the few instances the USG knows of where arrests were 
made, most suspects were released upon payment of a bribe.
    Taliban leaders, in particular, expressed a desire to cooperate on 
counternarcotics with U.S. and UNDCP officials. However, the major opium 
refining operations are located in Taliban-controlled territory, and the 
Taliban appear to have done nothing to date to discourage cultivation of 
opium poppy. The leaders state they cannot do so until international 
donors provide crop substitution and other assistance.
    Many sources have reported that all major factions require farmers 
to pay a tax on their opium production. Some reports also indicate that 
deeper involvement in trafficking is also common among Afghan leaders.
    The USG strongly promotes the UN Special Mission to Afghanistan's 
efforts to develop a broad-based national government that can address 
the problems of narcotics, terrorism and humanitarian concerns. We 
assist the peoples of Afghanistan, subject to resource availability, 
primarily through UN programs aimed at humanitarian relief, 
reconstruction, and counternarcotics.
    Inasmuch as legislation makes special allowance for continuation of 
such assistance generally and of assistance for Afghanistan 
specifically, notwithstanding any other provision of law, denying 
certification to Afghanistan would have minimal effect in terms of 
implementation of this policy.
    The continued large-scale cultivation and trafficking in 
Afghanistan, combined with the failure to initiate law enforcement 
actions, preclude a determination that Afghanistan has taken adequate 
counternarcotics steps on its own or that it has sufficiently cooperated 
with the USG in counternarcotics efforts, although Afghanistan is a 
party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Accordingly, denial of 
certification is appropriate.

Burma

    Burma produced 84% of the opium cultivated in Asia in 1996 and 
remains the world's largest producer of opium and heroin. Continuing 
lack of resources and commitment to effective drug control policies led 
to near record levels of opium cultivation, totaling 163,000 hectares 
with a potential yield of 2,560 metric tons of opium gum, or enough to 
produce 250 tons of heroin. While the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (SLORC) claimed an improvement in its record with regard to drug 
and precursor chemical seizures, these efforts were marginal, both in 
terms of results and in view of the overall level of opium production 
and trafficking 

[[Page 275]]

in Burma. The drug lord Khun Sa continues to be exempt 
from prosecution or extradition. Ethnic drug trafficking armies such as 
the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the Myanmar National Democratic 
Alliance Army (MNDAA), having negotiated ceasefires with the SLORC which 
permit them limited autonomy, remain armed and heavily involved in the 
heroin trade. Their leaders have used their relationship with Rangoon to 
increase their wealth, but prosperity has not filtered down to the 
ordinary people in the areas they control. Lack of enforcement against 
money laundering and an underdeveloped banking system have created an 
economic environment increasingly conducive to the use of drug profits 
in legitimate commerce. While there is no evidence that the government 
per se encourages or is involved in the drug trade, drug money is 
beginning to permeate the economy.
    The SLORC announced no new drug control policy initiatives in 1996. 
It did conduct some counternarcotics activities in areas controlled by 
the Kachin Defense Army, the Kokang Army, the MNDAA and the UWSA, 
seizing a total of 493 kilos of heroin, over three tons of ephedrine, 
5,677,525 amphetamine tablets and 2668.4 gallons of acetic anhydride. 
These actions did not seriously threaten the drug trafficking activities 
of the organizations in question. The unprecedented chemical precursor 
and amphetamine seizures, however, have alarmed Burmese authorities 
because they signal a possible future stimulants problem for the 
Burmese.
    Negotiations involving the Burmese Government, UNDCP, and Wa leaders 
on the ``Drug Control and Development in the Wa Region of Shan State'' 
project concluded in November. The goal is to bring about a gradual 
reduction of opium cultivation in the Wa area. The Burmese Cabinet has 
not yet formally approved the project. While the project is designed to 
incorporate a monitoring and evaluation component, donors have concerns 
about implementation.
    USG engagement of the Burmese government on counternarcotics issues 
remains limited. DEA maintains a liaison operation with Burmese police 
and military units involved in drug enforcement activities. The Burmese 
have also invited USG participation in a third joint opium yield survey 
in the Shan State. The U.S. will consider further assistance only upon 
the Burmese Government's demonstration of a strong commitment to 
narcotics control, the rule of law and significant political reform.

Colombia

    In 1996, as in previous years, Colombia remained the world's leading 
producer and distributor of cocaine and an important supplier of heroin 
and marijuana. In the same year, coca cultivation in the country 
increased by approximately 30 percent.
    As in 1995, the Colombian Government made only limited progress in 
1996 against the pervasive, narcotics-related corruption from which it 
suffers. In a process which can only be described as flawed, President 
Samper was exonerated of charges of corruption by the Colombian 
Congress. Moreover, Samper remained unwilling to confront fully the drug 
interests that contributed heavily to his Presidential campaign.
    President Samper pledged to push for stricter sentencing laws in 
1994, but there was only limited progress in 1996 to advance 
Congressional passage of legislation which would increase sentences for 
traffickers and 

[[Page 276]]

money launderers. As an apparent consequence, the 
Rodriguez Orejuela brothers--the notorious Cali drug leaders--received 
very light prison sentences which were not commensurate with their 
crimes. The Colombian government did not respond to the USG's request 
for extradition of four major drug traffickers and for most of the year 
it took no action in response to reliable USG information that narcotics 
traffickers continue to run their operations from prison. Troubling also 
was Samper's promotion and public praise for a drug-tainted military 
general--behavior which reinforces USG concern about the credibility of 
his stated commitment to serious narcotics control for Colombia.
    On the eradication front, the Colombian Government's strong 
opposition to testing more than one granular herbicide--in an effort to 
replace less effective liquid herbicides--is especially problematic in 
light of the significant expansion in coca cultivation.
    On the positive side, the serious work on the part of the Colombian 
National Police (CNP) as well as select elements of the military to 
confront drug trafficking must be highlighted. Government agreement to 
expand coca and opium eradication was taken on with determination by the 
CNP despite significant challenges including physical threats and lack 
of proper resources. In this regard, the USG was encouraged by evidence 
of increased cooperation from the Colombian military for the CNP in 
support of illegal crop eradication. The CNP and military also worked 
closely to counter narco- and guerrilla-sponsored public demonstrations 
against eradication.
    There were signs that newly appointed members of the cabinet are 
determined and committed to advance important counternarcotics 
objectives. A noteworthy achievement--pushed also by private Colombian 
citizens--was pressure on the Congress which resulted in passage, with 
retroactivity, of an asset forfeiture law. However, its 
constitutionality is already being challenged by those who would be 
affected by its implementation. In November, bilateral agreement was 
reached to expedite shipboarding procedures and a maritime agreement was 
signed in February 1997. The CNP and the Prosecutor General continued 
their efforts against corruption by firing corrupt police and 
prosecutors and by continuing investigations targetted against official 
corruption. However, without determined and committed leadership, much-
needed legal reform and a supportive political environment, real drug 
control successes by the CNP and other entities will be thwarted.
    Progress observed in some areas holds promise for serious drug 
control efforts in Colombia in the future. Nevertheless, because of 
high-level corruption, the privileged treatment accorded to major 
traffickers currently in jail, light sentencing of traffickers and the 
government's continued stand against extradition, the USG cannot certify 
Columbia as fully cooperating with the United States on drug control, or 
as having taken adequate steps on its own to meet the goals and 
objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.

Iran

    Iran remains an important transit country for opiates from 
Afghanistan and Pakistan destined primarily for processing in Turkey. 
The USG has no recent surveys of opium poppy cultivation in Iran, but 
other sources be-

[[Page 277]]

lieve cultivation has decreased, possibly as a result of 
the influx of cheap Afghan opium.
    The Government of Iran (GOI) has ratified the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, but the USG remains unaware of the passage of implementing 
legislation that would bring Iran into compliance with the requirements 
of the Convention. According to UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) and 
International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) missions that have visited 
the country, and reports received from countries with embassies in Iran, 
the GOI is attempting to meet at least some of the goals and objectives 
of the Convention. The USG cannot evaluate Iranian claims as we do not 
have diplomatic relations. There is no bilateral narcotics agreement or 
cooperation and Iran's performance is measured solely against the 
standards of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.
    The GOI has, according to reports by other nations, begun reaching 
out to Western countries in a very tentative fashion, seeking to 
establish a working counternarcotics relationship. There are, however, 
countervailing pressures and we know of no working law enforcement 
relationship. The GOI, Pakistan and UNDCP participate in a tripartite 
UNDCP law enforcement project, to which Iran contributes important 
resources according to UNDCP. In 1995, the latest year on which Iran 
reported, it claims to have seized 126 mt of opium, 2 mt of heroin and 
11 mt of morphine, as well as lost 133 citizens in battles against 
traffickers. The USG cannot verify these claims. The level of narcotics 
arriving in Turkey does not appear to have diminished according to USG 
sources.
    Credible reports have been received that corruption remains a 
problem. There have been accusations of corruption against individuals 
with access to very high levels of power. Low-level corruption remains a 
problem judging by the number of caravans that successfully evade 
massive physical barriers at Iran's eastern border. We do not know how 
extensively or how equitably Iran administers its anti-corruption 
program.
    Sentences imposed for narcotics trafficking are very harsh and 1,000 
people have been executed for trafficking since 1989.

Nigeria

    Nigeria is the focal point of West African narcotics trafficking. 
Narcotics producing and trafficking organizations in Asia, South America 
and, increasingly, Nigeria itself either use Nigeria as a transshipment 
point or rely on Nigerian courier networks to transport Asian heroin and 
South American cocaine destined for U.S. or European markets. Nigerian 
trafficking organizations are among the leading carriers of Southeast 
and Southwest Asian heroin into the United States. In addition, Nigerian 
traffickers ship cannabis--the only illicit drug produced in Nigeria--to 
Europe and other West African countries. The Government of Nigeria (GON) 
has failed to address corruption adequately among law enforcement and 
other government agencies, hindering counternarcotics efforts.
    Although the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), the one 
positive internal agency working against drug trafficking in Nigeria, 
has attempted to combat trafficking and corruption, the GON has left it 
woefully underfunded. Lack of coordination among police, intelligence 
and other law enforcement agencies also prevents effective progress 
against narco-traffickers.

[[Page 278]]

    Nigerian trafficking organizations operate sophisticated money 
laundering operations in addition to controlling courier networks. These 
organizations have been quick to adapt in response to vigorous 
international law enforcement, as well as to efforts made by the NDLEA 
within Nigeria. They have found new ways to evade detection and to alter 
and expand their narcotics smuggling routes and markets; as GON 
counternarcotics efforts have effectively reduced the amount of drugs 
shipped through international airports within Nigeria, courier networks 
have increasingly relied on overland shipments to transport narcotics. 
Nigerian trafficking organizations actively recruit couriers of diverse 
nationalities, backgrounds and ages.
    Perhaps the most glaring omission by the GON is its failure to 
provide funding for its law enforcement employees, thus making them ever 
more vulnerable to bribery and related forms of corruption, and to 
provide funding for implementation of its laws and strategies. Most law 
enforcement employees are paid far less than is sufficient to feed, 
clothe and house their families. In addition, the GON has taken no 
meaningful steps towards cooperation with the United States on 
extraditions, information sharing or prosecution of arrested fraud 
suspects; nor has it moved significantly towards meeting the goals and 
objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.

Syria

    For several years, Syria has been an important transit country for 
drugs flowing into and out of Lebanon and, in many cases, on to Europe 
and the United States. The increase in seizures in 1996 over 1995 
(especially of hashish) points to increased vigilance by Syrian 
authorities, but could imply as well that the total flow of drugs across 
Syria is increasing. Additionally, the presence of approximately 25,000 
Syrian troops in the Lebanese Bekaa Valley makes Syrian cooperation with 
Lebanese officials a substantial element in the fight against drug 
production and trafficking there. Allegations of corruption against 
Syrian military officials stationed in Lebanon continued in 1996.
    The Government of Syria (SARG) restructured its Syrian National 
Police force in 1996, thus creating a separate and independent Counter-
Narcotics Division. The SARG continued to assist anti-narcotics efforts 
in Lebanon during 1996, donating more than a million fruit trees for the 
Lebanese crop substitution program. Though widespread reports claim that 
Syrian military and security personnel continue to profit from the drug 
trade, the SARG neither initiated corruption investigations nor brought 
anti-narcotics charges against any of these individuals in 1996.
    Syria is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Though Syria made 
significant progress in some anti-narcotics efforts in 1996, including 
more aggressive seizures of hashish and various types of amphetamines, 
it did not meet some of the other goals and objectives of the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention; specifically, the SARG did not move aggressively enough 
against narcotics transiting Syrian territory, especially to and from 
Lebanon, it did not take sufficient action towards locating and 
dismantling drug laboratories in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon, and 
it ignored serious allegations against Syrian officials of involvement 
with drug traffickers. Syria does not have a bilateral narcotics 
agreement with the United States.

Continuation of Iran Emergency

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, 
including its support for international terrorism, efforts to undermine 
the Middle East peace process, and acquisition of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means to deliver them. On May 6, 1995, I issued 
Executive Order 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must 
continue in effect beyond March 15, 1997. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the 
emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency 
separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 
12170, this renewal is distinct from the emergency renewal of October 
1996. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

Memorandum of March 27, 1997

Strengthened Protections for Human Subjects of Classified Research

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the 
Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of 
Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Transportation, the 
Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs, the Director of Central Intelligence, the Administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the Agency 
for International Development, the Administrator of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Director of the National 
Science Foundation, the Chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, [and] 
the Chair of the Consumer Product Safety Commission

I have worked hard to restore trust and ensure openness in government. 
This memorandum will further our progress toward these goals by 
strengthening the Federal Government's protections for human subjects of 
classified research.
In January 1994, I established the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation 
Experiments (the ``Advisory Committee'') to examine reports that the 
government had funded and conducted unethical human radiation 
experiments during the Cold War. I directed the Advisory Committee to 
uncover the truth, recommend steps to right past wrongs, and propose 
ways to prevent unethical human subjects research from occurring in the 
future. In its October 1995 final report, the Advisory Committee 
recommended, among other things, that the government modify its policy 
governing classified research on human subjects (``Recommendations for 
Balancing National Security Interests and the Rights of the Public,'' 
Recommendation 15, Final Report, Advisory Committee on Human Radiation 
Experiments). This memorandum sets forth policy changes in response to 
those recommendations.
The Advisory Committee acknowledged that it is in the Nation's interest 
to continue to allow the government to conduct classified research 
involving human subjects where such research serves important national 
security interests. The Advisory Committee found, however, that 
classified human subjects research should be a ``rare event'' and that 
the ``subjects of such research, as well as the interests of the public 
in openness in science and in government, deserve special protections.'' 
The Advisory Committee was concerned about ``exceptions to informed 
consent requirements and the absence of any special review and approval 
process for human research that is to be classified.'' The Advisory 
Committee recommended that in all classified research projects the 
agency conducting or sponsoring the research meet the following 
requirements:

    --obtain informed consent from all human subjects;
    --inform subjects of the identity of the sponsoring agency;
    --inform subjects that the project involves classified research;

[[Page 282]]

    --obtain approval by an ``independent panel of nongovernmental 
experts and citizen representatives, all with the necessary security 
clearances'' that reviews scientific merit, risk-benefit tradeoffs, and 
ensures subjects have enough information to make informed decisions to 
give valid consent; and

    --maintain permanent records of the panel's deliberations and 
consent procedures.
This memorandum implements these recommendations with some 
modifications. For classified research, it prohibits waiver of informed 
consent and requires researchers to disclose that the project is 
classified. For all but minimal risk studies, it requires researchers to 
inform subjects of the sponsoring agency. It also requires permanent 
recordkeeping.
The memorandum also responds to the Advisory Committee's call for a 
special review process for classified human subjects research. It 
requires that institutional review boards for secret projects include a 
nongovernmental member, and establishes an appeals process so that any 
member of a review board who believes a project should not go forward 
can appeal the boards' decision to approve it.
Finally, this memorandum sets forth additional steps to ensure that 
classified human research is rare. It requires the heads of Federal 
agencies to disclose annually the number of secret human research 
projects undertaken by their agency. It also prohibits any agency from 
conducting secret human research without first promulgating a final rule 
applying the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects, as 
modified in this memorandum, to the agency.
These steps, set forth in detail below, will preserve the government's 
ability to conduct any necessary classified research involving human 
subjects while ensuring adequate protection of research participants.
1. Modifications to the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human 
Subjects as it Affects Classified Research. All agencies that may 
conduct or support classified research that is subject to the 1991 
Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (``Common Rule'') 
(56 Fed. Reg. 28010-28018) shall promptly jointly publish in the Federal 
Register the following proposed revisions to the Common Rule as it 
affects classified research. The Office for Protection from Research 
Risks in the Department of Health and Human Services shall be the lead 
agency and, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, 
shall coordinate the joint rulemaking.

    (a) The agencies shall jointly propose to prohibit waiver of 
informed consent for classified research.
    (b) The agencies shall jointly propose to prohibit the use of 
expedited review procedures under the Common Rule for classified 
research.
    (c) The joint proposal should request comment on whether all 
research exemptions under the Common Rule should be maintained for 
classified research.
    (d) The agencies shall jointly propose to require that in classified 
research involving human subjects, two additional elements of 
information be provided to potential subjects when consent is sought 
from subjects:
(i) the identity of the sponsoring Federal agency. Exceptions are 
allowed if the head of the sponsoring agency determines that provid-

[[Page 283]]

ing this information could compromise intelligence sources 
or methods and that the research involves no more than minimal 
risk to subjects. The determination about sources and methods is 
to be made in consultation with the Director of Central 
Intelligence and the Assistant to the President for National 
Security Affairs. The determination about risk is to be made in 
consultation with the Director of the White House Office of 
Science and Technology Policy.

(ii) a statement that the project is ``classified'' and an 
explanation of what classified means.
    (e) The agencies shall jointly propose to modify the institutional 
review board (``IRB'') approval process for classified human subjects 
research as follows:
(i) The Common Rule currently requires that each IRB ``include at 
least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the 
institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a 
person who is affiliated with the institution.'' For classified 
research, the agencies shall define ``not otherwise affiliated 
with the institution,'' as a nongovernmental member with the 
appropriate security clearance.

(ii) Under the Common Rule, research projects are approved by the 
IRB if a ``majority of those (IRB) members present at a meeting'' 
approved the project. For classified research, the agencies shall 
propose to permit any member of the IRB who does not believe a 
specific project should be approved by the IRB to appeal a 
majority decision to approve the project to the head of the 
sponsoring agency. If the agency head affirms the IRB's decision 
to approve the project, the dissenting IRB member may appeal the 
IRB's decisions to the Director of OSTP. The Director of OSTP 
shall review the IRB's decision and approve or disapprove the 
project, or, at the Director's discretion, convene an IRB made up 
of nongovernmental officials, each with the appropriate security 
clearances, to approve or disapprove the project.

(iii) IRBs for classified research shall determine whether 
potential subjects need access to classified information to make a 
valid informed consent decision.

2. Final Rules. Agencies shall, within 1 year, after considering any 
comments, promulgate final rules on the protection of human subjects of 
classified research.
3. Agency Head Approval of Classified Research Projects. Agencies may 
not conduct any classified human research project subject to the Common 
Rule unless the agency head has personally approved the specific 
project.
4. Annual Public Disclosure of the Number of Classified Research 
Projects. Each agency head shall inform the Director of OSTP by 
September 30 of each year of the number of classified research projects 
involving human subjects underway on that date, the number completed in 
the previous 12-month period, and the number of human subjects in each 
project. The Director of OSTP shall report the total number of 
classified research projects and participating subjects to the President 
and shall then report to the congressional armed services and 
intelligence committees and further shall publish the numbers in the 
Federal Register.

[[Page 284]]

5. Definitions. For purposes of this memorandum, the terms ``research'' 
and ``human subject'' shall have the meaning set forth in the Common 
Rule. ``Classified human research'' means research involving 
``classified information'' as defined in Executive Order 12958.
6. No Classified Human Research Without Common Rule. Beginning one year 
after the date of this memorandum, no agency shall conduct or support 
classified human research without having proposed and promulgated the 
Common Rule, including the changes set forth in this memorandum and any 
subsequent amendments.
7. Judicial Review. This memorandum is not intended to create any right 
or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party 
against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other 
persons.
8. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall publish this 
memorandum in the Federal Register.

                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, May 23, 1997.

Memorandum of Justification Regarding Determination Under Section 620I 
of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as Amended

The Administration fully supports the goal of maintaining open 
humanitarian aid corridors and has actively worked through diplomatic 
channels to encourage the speedy and efficient flow of humanitarian 
goods. The application of section 620I requires a careful consideration 
of the circumstances in each case. This is particularly true with 
respect to Turkey.

[[Page 288]]

Strong feelings of ethnic kinship exist between the Turks and 
Azerbaijanis, and the Turkish government has resisted public pressures 
to become directly involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Until 
March, 1993, Turkey permitted U.S. humanitarian and other non-military 
shipments destined for Yerevan to transit Turkish territory in response 
to the grave situation in Armenia. However, Turkey closed its land 
borders to Armenia in 1993 when local Armenian forces seized large areas 
of Azerbaijan despite UN Security Council resolutions calling for the 
withdrawal of all occupying forces and cessation of hostilities.
Since 1994, Turkey has taken several unilateral steps to improve its 
bilateral ties with Armenia while balancing its relations with 
Azerbaijan and supporting the OSCE's Minsk Group talks on resolving the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Most notably, Turkey reopened an air corridor 
to Armenia in 1995. In another positive step, in March, 1996 Turkish 
Prime Minister Yilmaz publicly expressed willingness to reopen the land 
border with Armenia once Armenia and Azerbaijan agree upon a statement 
of principles for a settlement of the conflict. Turkey's land border 
with Armenia, however, remains closed for the present. A large volume of 
assistance--mostly food and oil--as well as an increasing volume of 
commercial traffic flow by ship through the Turkish Straits to Georgian 
ports for shipment by rail to Armenia. Should the border be reopened, we 
are likely to continue to ship most assistance to Armenia through 
Georgia to take advantage of its more developed rail network.
It is very much in our national security interests not to terminate U.S. 
assistance programs for Turkey. Such a termination would create 
significant difficulties in our bilateral relations, affecting a broad 
range of national security interests. Such a termination would also 
reduce prospects for the successful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict.
Turkey is at the nexus of a number of issues that are critical for the 
U.S. on the Eurasian continent: securing peace in the Balkans, advancing 
a settlement in Cyprus and resolution of Aegean issues, containing Iraq 
and Iran, bringing stability to the Caucasus, implementing the CFE 
treaty, addressing the future of NATO and bringing Caspian Basin oil to 
the West. Turkey hosts the continuing U.S.-led coalition effort to 
protect the Kurdish populations of northern Iraq, and has increasingly 
important and useful relationships with Israel and the moderate Arab 
states of the Middle East. Finally, Turkey is important for U.S. trade 
and investment, and has been designated as one of the ten big emerging 
markets for U.S. companies by the Department of Commerce.
There are over 3,000 uniformed military and civilian DoD personnel 
(excluding dependents) stationed in Turkey, a democratic, secular nation 
in a region with weak democratic traditions, and widespread political 
instability. Incirlik, the easternmost NATO Air Base, and other NATO-
dedicated bases in Turkey are essential for the projection of U.S./NATO 
power into an unstable region having critical oil resources. Some 2,700 
sorties were flown out of Incirlik during the Gulf War.

Notice of May 28, 1997

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Bosnian Serbs

 On May 30, 1992, by Executive Order 12808, President Bush declared a 
national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and 
Montenegro, blocking all property and interests in property of those 
Governments. President Bush took additional measures to prohibit trade 
and other transactions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia 
and Montenegro) by Executive Orders 12810 and 12831, issued on June 5, 
1992, and January 15, 1993, respectively. On April 25, 1993, I issued 
Executive Order 12846, blocking the property and interests in property 
of all commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or 
entities organized or located in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro), and prohibiting trade-related transactions by 
United States persons involving those areas of the Republic of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina controlled by Bosnian Serb forces and the United Nations 
Protected Areas in the Republic of Croatia. On October 25, 1994, because 
of the actions and policies of the Bosnian Serbs, I expanded the scope 
of the national emergency by issuing Executive Order 12934 to block the 
property of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory 
that they control within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well 
as the property of any entity organized or located in, or controlled by 
any person in, or resident in, those areas.
 On December 27, 1995, I issued Presidential Determination No. 96-7, 
directing the Secretary of the Treasury, inter alia, to suspend the 
application of sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro) pursuant to the above-referenced Executive 
orders and to continue to block property previously blocked until 
provision is made to address claims or encumbrances, including the 
claims of the other successor states of the former Yugoslavia. This 
sanctions relief, in conformity with United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1022 of November 22, 1995 (hereinafter the ``Resolution''), 
was an essential factor motivating Serbia and Montenegro's acceptance of 
the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
initialed by the parties in Dayton on November 21, 1995, and signed in 
Paris on December 14, 1995 (hereinafter the ``Peace Agreement''). The 
sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) were accordingly suspended prospectively, effective January 
16, 1996. Sanctions imposed on the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities 
and on the territory that they control within the Republic of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina were subsequently suspended prospectively, effective May 10, 
1996, also in conformity with the Peace Agreement and the Resolution. 
Sanctions against both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) and the Bosnian Serbs were subsequently terminated by United 
Nations Security Council Resolution 1074 of October 1, 1996. This 
termination, however, did not end the requirement of the Resolution that 
blocked funds and assets that are subject to claims and encumbrances 
remain blocked, until unblocked in accordance with applicable law.

[[Page 290]]

In the last year, substantial progress has been achieved to bring about 
a settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia acceptable to the 
parties. Elections occurred in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
as provided for in the Peace Agreement, and the Bosnian Serb forces have 
continued to respect the zones of separation as provided in the Peace 
Agreement. The ultimate disposition of the various remaining categories 
of blocked assets is now being addressed, beginning with the unblocking 
of five Yugoslav vessels located in various United States ports 
effective May 19, 1997.
Until the status of all remaining blocked property is resolved, the 
Peace Agreement implemented, and the terms of the Resolution met, the 
national emergency declared on May 30, 1992, as expanded in scope on 
October 25, 1994, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with 
that emergency must continue beyond May 30, 1997.
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
and the Bosnian Serb forces and those areas of the Republic of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian Serb forces. This

Memorandum of July 16, 1997

Implementation of Revised Air Quality Standards for Ozone and 
Particulate Matter

Memorandum for the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency

I have approved the issuance of new air quality standards to provide 
important new health protection for all Americans by further controlling 
pollution from ozone and particulate matter. These new standards promise 
to improve the lives of millions of Americans in coming years.
Consistent with my Administration's approach to regulatory decision 
making, I also want to ensure that these new standards are implemented 
in a common sense, cost-effective manner. It is critically important 
that these standards be implemented in the most flexible, reasonable, 
and least burdensome manner, and that the Federal Government work with 
State and local governments and other interested parties to this end.
I have determined that there are certain essential elements of an 
approach to implementation that will accomplish these goals. I direct 
you to use the following elements when implementing the new air quality 
standards:

    1. Implementation of the air quality standards is to be carried out 
to maximize common sense, flexibility, and cost effectiveness;

    2. Implementation shall ensure that the Nation continues its 
progress toward cleaner air by respecting the agreements already made by 
States, communities, and businesses to clean up the air, and by avoiding 
additional burdens with respect to the beneficial measures already 
underway in many areas. Implementation also shall be structured to 
reward State and local governments that take early action to provide 
clean air to their residents; and to respond to the fact that pollution 
travels hundreds of miles and crosses many State lines;

    3. Implementation shall ensure that the Environmental Protection 
Agency (``Agency'') completes its next periodic review of particulate 
matter, including review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, 
within 5 years of issuance of the new standards, as contemplated by the 
Clean Air Act. Thus, by July 2002, the Agency will have determined, 
based on data available from its review, whether to revise or maintain 
the standards. This determination will have been made before any areas 
have been designated as ``nonattainment'' under the PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
standards and before imposition of any new controls related to the 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards; and

[[Page 294]]

    4. Implementation is to be accomplished with the minimum amount of 
paperwork and shall seek to reduce current paperwork requirements 
wherever possible.
Excellent preliminary work on the strategy for carrying out these 
implementation principles has been accomplished by an interagency 
Administration group and I commend that group for these important 
efforts. The group's work is set out in the attached plan, which is 
hereby incorporated by reference.
In order for the implementation of these standards to proceed in 
accordance with the goals I have established, I hereby direct you, in 
consultation with all affected agencies and parties, to undertake the 
steps appropriate under law to carry out the attached plan and to 
complete all necessary guidance and rulemaking no later than December 
31, 1998.
This memorandum is for the purposes of internal Administration 
management only, and is not judicially reviewable.
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination and plan 
in the Federal Register.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE
    Washington, July 16, 1997.

Implementation Plan for Revised Air Quality Standards

An interagency Administration group has discussed and evaluated 
approaches for the common sense, flexible, and cost effective 
implementation of the revised National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(NAAQS) for ozone and particulate matter (PM). This document reflects 
the preliminary work by that group on a strategy for implementing these 
health-based standards consistent with the principles discussed by 
President Clinton in his announcement of the standards. The 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will continue to work with other 
Federal agencies, State and local governments, small businesses, 
industry, and environmental and public health groups to fully develop 
and implement this strategy.
This implementation plan provides a road map for areas to attain the 
standards and protect public health without sacrificing economic growth. 
The goals of the plan are to: 1) maintain the progress currently being 
made toward cleaner air and respect the agreements and technological 
progress already made by communities and businesses to pursue clean air; 
2) reward State and local governments and businesses that take early 
action to reduce air pollution levels through cost-effective approaches; 
3) respond to the fact that pollution can travel hundreds of miles and 
cross many State lines; 4) work with the States to develop control 
programs which employ regulatory flexibility to minimize economic 
impacts on businesses large and small to the greatest possible degree 
consistent with public health protection; 5) minimize planning and 
regulatory burdens for State and local governments and businesses where 
air quality problems are regional, not local, in nature; 6) ensure that 
air quality planning and related Federal, State, and local planning are 
coordinated; and 7) recognize the substantial lead time necessary for 
State and local governments and businesses to plan for and meet 
standards for a new indicator of PM.

[[Page 295]]

The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the EPA to set air quality standards to 
protect the public health and the environment without consideration of 
costs. The 1997 revisions to the NAAQS for ground level ozone and PM 
fulfill this requirement. However, the Act recognizes that the EPA and 
the States must work together to develop cost-effective, flexible, and 
fair implementation plans if the standards are to be met as 
expeditiously as practicable.
There are a number of important linkages between these pollutants. There 
is also a linkage between these pollutants and their precursors and 
regional haze problems. Promulgation of the two standards simultaneously 
provides a more complete description of the health and environmental 
effects associated with two of the major components of air pollution. It 
can help States and local areas better manage their air quality by 
focusing on the common precursors of both pollutants and provides the 
opportunity to work jointly with industry to address common sources of 
multiple air pollutants in a comprehensive manner. This will lead to 
more effective and efficient protection of public health and the 
environment.
In addition to the interagency process, the EPA has been soliciting 
other input. While the review of the ozone and PM NAAQS was underway, 
the EPA convened a group of air quality experts representing industry, 
environmental, and public health groups; State and local governments; 
other Federal agencies; and academia under the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act (FACA). This group was charged by the Administrator of the 
EPA to develop innovative, flexible, and cost-effective implementation 
strategies that utilize a mix of control measures to address ozone, PM, 
and regional haze. This group will continue working with the EPA to 
further develop this strategy.
In addition, all Federal agencies will continue to do their part in 
carrying out the Federal responsibilities in the State/Federal 
partnership that has been so successful in improving air quality in the 
United States. In addition, the EPA, in partnership with the other 
Federal agencies, has developed an interagency research program that is 
described in Appendix 1 for the coordination of future research on both 
ground level ozone and PM.

Implementation of Ozone Standard

Phase-out of 1-hour standard

The revised ozone standard is intended to replace the current 1-hour 
standard with an 8-hour standard. However, the 1-hour standard will 
continue to apply to areas not attaining it for an interim period to 
ensure an effective transition to the new 8-hour standard.
Subpart 2 of part D of Title I of the CAA addresses the requirements for 
different classifications of nonattainment areas that do not meet the 
current 1-hour standard (i.e., marginal, moderate, serious, and severe). 
These requirements include such items as mandatory control measures, 
annual rate of progress requirements for emission reductions, and offset 
ratios for the emissions from new or modified stationary sources. These 
requirements have contributed significantly to the improvements in air 
quality since 1990. Although the EPA initially offered an interpretation 
of the CAA in 

[[Page 296]]

the proposed Interim Implementation Policy (IIP) (61 FR 
65764, December 13, 1996) under which the provisions of Subpart 2 would 
not apply to existing ozone nonattainment areas once a new ozone NAAQS 
is promulgated, the EPA has reconsidered that interpretation after 
receiving comments on the proposed IIP. Based on EPA's legal review, the 
Agency has concluded that Subpart 2 should continue to apply as a matter 
of law for the purpose of achieving attainment of the current 1-hour 
standard. Once an area attains the 1-hour standard, those provisions 
will no longer apply and the area's implementation of the new 8-hour 
standard would be governed only by the provisions of Subpart 1 of Part D 
of Title I.
To streamline the process and minimize the burden on existing 
nonattainment areas, the 1-hour standard will cease to apply to an area 
upon a determination by the EPA that an area has attained air quality 
that meets the 1-hour standard. In light of the implementation of the 
new 8-hour standard, which is more stringent than the existing 1-hour 
standard, States will not have to prepare maintenance plans for those 
areas that attain the 1-hour standard. Within 90 days, the EPA will 
publish an action identifying existing nonattainment areas and 
maintenance areas to which the 1-hour standard will cease to apply 
because they have attained the 1-hour standard.
For areas where the air quality does not currently attain the 1-hour 
standard, the 1-hour standard will continue in effect. The provisions of 
Subpart 2 would also apply to designated nonattainment areas until such 
time as each area has air quality meeting the 1-hour standard. At that 
time, the EPA will take action so that the 1-hour standard no longer 
applies to such areas. In any event, the ``bump-up'' provisions of 
Subpart 2, which require areas not attaining the standard by the 
applicable attainment date to be reclassified to the next higher 
classification, will not be triggered by the failure of any area to meet 
the new 8-hour standard. The purpose of retaining the current standard 
is to ensure a smooth legal and practical transition to the new 
standard.

Implementation of New 8-hour Ozone standard

This section discusses the general timeline for implementing the 8-hour 
standard, the importance of regional approaches to address ozone and 
options for classifying and designating areas relative to the 8-hour 
ozone NAAQS.

General Timeline

Following promulgation of a revised NAAQS, the Clean Air Act provides up 
to 3 years for State governors to recommend and the EPA to designate 
areas according to their most recent air quality. In addition, States 
will have up to 3 years from designation to develop and submit State 
Implementation Plans (SIPs) to provide for attainment of the new 
standard. Under this approach, areas would be designated as 
nonattainment for the 8-hour standard by 2000 and would submit their 
nonattainment SIPs by 2003. The Act allows up to 10 years plus two 1-
year extensions from the date of designation for areas to attain the 
revised NAAQS.

Regional Strategy

Ozone is a pollutant that travels great distances and it is increasingly 
clear that it must be addressed as a regional problem. For the past 2 
years the EPA has been working with the 37 most eastern States through 
the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) in the belief that reducing 
interstate 

[[Page 297]]

pollution will help all areas in the OTAG region attain the 
NAAQS. A regional approach can reduce compliance costs and allow many 
areas to avoid most traditional nonattainment planning requirements. The 
OTAG was sponsored by the Environmental Council of States, with the 
objective of evaluating ozone transport and recommending strategies for 
mitigating interstate pollution. The OTAG completed its work in June 
1997 and forwarded recommendations to the EPA. Based on these 
recommendations, in September 1997, the EPA will propose a rule 
requiring States in the OTAG region that are significantly contributing 
to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance of attainment in 
downwind States to submit SIPs to reduce their interstate pollution. The 
EPA will issue the final rule by September 1998.
If the States choose to establish a regional emission cap-and-trade 
system, modeled on the current acid rain program, reductions can be 
obtained at a lower cost. The EPA will encourage and assist the States 
to develop and implement such a program. Most important, based on the 
EPA's review of the latest modeling, a regional approach, coupled with 
the implementation of other already existing State and Federal Clean Air 
Act requirements, will allow the vast majority of areas that currently 
meet the 1-hour standard but would not otherwise meet the new 8-hour 
standard to achieve healthful air quality without additional local 
controls.
Areas in the OTAG region that would exceed the new standard after the 
adoption of the regional strategy, including areas that do not meet the 
current 1-hour standard, will benefit as well because the regional 
NO<INF>X</INF> program will reduce the extent of additional local 
measures needed to achieve the 8-hour standard. In many cases these 
regional reductions may be adequate to meet CAA progress requirements 
for a number of years, allowing areas to defer additional local 
controls.

Transitional Classification

For areas that attain the 1-hour standard but not the new 8-hour 
standard, the EPA will follow a flexible implementation approach that 
encourages cleaner air sooner, responds to the fact that ozone is a 
regional as well as local problem, and eliminates unnecessary planning 
and regulatory burdens for State and local governments. A primary 
element of the plan will be the establishment under Section 172(a)(1) of 
the CAA of a special ``transitional'' classification for areas that 
participate in a regional strategy and/or that opt to submit early plans 
addressing the new 8-hour standard. Because many areas will need little 
or no additional new local emission reductions to reach attainment, 
beyond those reductions that will be achieved through the regional 
control strategy, and will come into attainment earlier than otherwise 
required, the EPA will exercise its discretion under the law to 
eliminate unnecessary local planning requirements for such areas. The 
EPA will revise its rules for new source review (NSR) and conformity so 
that States will be able to comply with only minor revisions to their 
existing programs in areas classified as transitional. During this 
rulemaking, the EPA will also reexamine the NSR requirements applicable 
to existing nonattainment areas, in order to deal with issues of 
fairness among existing and new nonattainment areas. The transitional 
classification will be available for any area attaining the 1-hour 
standard but not attaining the 8-hour standard as of the time the EPA 
promulgates designa-

[[Page 298]]

tions for the 8-hour standard. Areas will follow the 
approaches described below based on their status.
(1) Areas attaining the 1-hour standard, but not attaining the 8-hour 
standard, that would attain the 8-hour standard through the 
implementation of the regional NO<INF>X</INF> transport strategy for the 
East.
Based on the OTAG analyses, areas in the OTAG region that can reach 
attainment through implementation of the regional transport strategy 
would not be required to adopt and implement additional local measures. 
When the EPA designates these areas under section 107(d), it will place 
them in the new transitional classification if they would attain the 
standard through implementation of the regional transport strategy and 
are in a State that by 2000 submits an implementation plan that includes 
control measures to achieve the emission reductions required by the 
EPA's rule for States in the OTAG region. This is 3 years earlier than 
an attainment SIP would otherwise be required. The EPA anticipates that 
it will be able to determine whether such areas will attain based on the 
OTAG and other regional modeling and that no additional local modeling 
would be required.
(2) Areas attaining the 1-hour standard but not attaining the 8-hour 
standard for which a regional transport strategy is not sufficient for 
attainment of the 8-hour standard.
To encourage early planning and attainment for the 8-hour standard, the 
EPA will make the transitional classification available to areas not 
attaining the 8-hour standard that will need additional local measures 
beyond the regional transport strategy, as well as to areas that are not 
affected by the regional transport strategy, provided they meet certain 
criteria. To receive the transitional classification, these areas must 
submit an attainment SIP prior to the designation and classification 
process in 2000. The SIP must demonstrate attainment of the 8-hour 
standard and provide for the implementation of the necessary emissions 
reductions on the same time schedule as the regional transport 
reductions. The EPA will work with affected areas to develop a 
streamlined attainment demonstration. By submitting these attainment 
plans earlier than would have otherwise been required, these areas would 
be eligible for the transitional classification and its benefits and 
would achieve cleaner air much sooner than otherwise required.
(3) Areas not attaining the 1-hour standard and not attaining the 8-hour 
standard
The majority of areas not attaining the 1-hour standard have made 
substantial progress in evaluating their air quality problems and 
developing plans to reduce emissions of ozone-causing pollutants. These 
areas will be eligible for the transitional classification provided that 
they attain the 1-hour standard by the year 2000 and comply with the 
appropriate provisions of section (1) or (2) above depending upon which 
conditions they meet.
Areas not Eligible for the Transitional Classification
For these areas, their work on planning and control programs to meet the 
1-hour standard by their current attainment date (e.g., 2005 for 
Philadelphia and 2007 for Chicago) will take them a long way toward 
meeting the 8-hour standard. While the additional local reductions that 
they will need to achieve the 8-hour standard must occur prior to their 
8-hour attainment date (e.g., 2010), for virtually all areas the 
additional reductions needed to achieve the 8-hour standard can occur 
after the 1-hour attainment date. 

[[Page 299]]

This approach allows them to make 
continued progress toward attaining the 8-hour standard throughout the 
entire period without requiring new additional local controls for 
attaining the 8-hour standard until the 1-hour standard is attained. 
These areas, however, will need to submit an implementation plan within 
3 years of designation as nonattainment for the new standard for 
achieving the 8-hour standard. Such a plan can rely in large part on 
measures needed to attain the 1-hour standard. For virtually all of 
these areas, no additional local control measures beyond those needed to 
meet the requirements of Subpart 2 and needed in response to the 
regional transport strategy would be required to be implemented prior to 
their applicable attainment date for the 1-hour standard. Nonattainment 
areas that do not attain the 1-hour standard by their attainment date 
would continue to make progress in accordance with the requirements of 
Subpart 2; the control measures needed to meet the progress requirements 
under Subpart 2 would generally be sufficient for meeting the control 
measure and progress requirements of Subpart 1 as well.

Implementation of Particulate Matter Standards

As required under the Act, within the next 5 years the EPA will complete 
the next periodic review of the PM criteria and standards, including 
review by the CASAC. As with all NAAQS reviews, the purpose is to update 
the pertinent scientific and technical information and to determine 
whether it is appropriate to revise the standards in order to protect 
the public health with an adequate margin of safety or to protect the 
public welfare. Although the EPA has concluded that the current 
scientific knowledge provides a strong basis for the revised PM<INF>10</INF> 
and new PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards, there remain scientific 
uncertainties associated with the health and environmental effects of PM 
and the means of reducing them.
The following steps discussed below and in Appendix 1, Interagency 
Research Program, will address these concerns. First, recognizing the 
importance of developing a better understanding of the effects of fine 
particles on human health, including their causes and mechanisms, as 
well as the species and sources of PM<INF>2.5</INF>, the EPA will 
continue to sponsor research, particularly in these areas. Second, the 
Administrator of the EPA will promptly initiate a new review of the 
scientific criteria on the effects of airborne particles on human health 
and the environment. Within 90 days, the EPA will develop and provide to 
CASAC a plan and proposed schedule for this review to assure that the 
review is completed within 5 years. The plan and schedule will be 
published in the Federal Register. Thus, by July 2002, the Agency will 
have determined, based on data available from its review, whether to 
revise or maintain the standards. This determination will have been made 
before any areas have been designated nonattainment under the PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
standards and before imposition of any new controls related to the 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards.

Implementation of New PM<INF>2.5</INF> NAAQS

As set forth in the EPA's final action regarding PM, the EPA is 
establishing a new indicator for fine particles (i.e., PM<INF>2.5</INF>) 
and promulgating new PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards. Monitoring and planning 
will be required before control measures to address these standards 
would be required. Therefore, the first pri-

[[Page 300]]

ority for implementing them 
is establishment of a comprehensive monitoring network to determine 
ambient fine particle concentrations across the country. The monitoring 
network will help the EPA and the States determine which areas do not 
meet the new air quality standards, what are the major sources of 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> in various regions, and what action is needed to clean 
up the air. The EPA and the States will consult with affected 
stakeholders on the design of the network and will then establish the 
network, which will consist of approximately 1,500 monitors. All 
monitors will provide for limited speciation, or analysis of the 
chemical composition, of the particles measured. At least 50 of the 
monitors will provide for a more comprehensive speciation of the 
particles. The EPA will work with states to deploy the PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
monitoring network. Based on the ambient monitoring data we have seen to 
date, these would generally not include agricultural areas. The EPA will 
fund the cost of purchasing the monitors, as well as the cost of 
analyzing particles collected at the monitors to determine their 
chemical composition.
Because the EPA is establishing standards for a new indicator for PM 
(i.e., PM<INF>2.5</INF>), it is critical to develop the best information 
possible before attainment and nonattainment designation decisions are 
made. Three calendar years of Federal reference method monitoring data 
will be used to determine whether areas meet or do not meet the 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards. Three years of data will be available from 
the earliest monitors in the spring of 2001, and 3 years of data will be 
available from all monitors in 2004. Following this monitoring schedule 
and allowing time for data analysis, Governors and the EPA will not be 
able to make the first determinations as to which areas should be 
designated nonattainment until at least 2002, 5 years from now. The 
Clean Air Act, however, requires that the EPA make designation 
determinations (i.e., attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable) 
within 2 to 3 years of revising a NAAQS. To fulfill this requirement, in 
1999 the EPA will issue ``unclassifiable'' designations for 
PM<INF>2.5</INF>. These designations will not trigger the planning or 
control requirements of part D of Title I of the Act.
When the EPA designates PM<INF>2.5</INF> nonattainment areas pursuant to 
the Governors' recommendations beginning in 2002, areas will be allowed 
3 years to develop and submit to the EPA pollution control plans showing 
how they will meet the new standards. Areas will then have up to 10 
years from their redesignation to nonattainment to attain the PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
standards with the possibility of two 1-year extensions.
In developing strategies for attaining the PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards, 
it is important to focus on measures that decrease emissions that 
contribute to regional pollution. Available information indicates that 
nearly one-third of the areas projected not to meet the new PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
standards, primarily in the Eastern United States, could come into 
compliance as a result of the regional SO<INF>2</INF> emission 
reductions already mandated under the Clean Air Act's acid rain program, 
which will be fully implemented between 2000 and 2010. Similarly, the 
Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission, consisting of Western 
States and tribes, committed to reducing regional emissions of 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> precursors (sulfates, nitrates, and organics) to 
improve visibility across the Colorado Plateau.
As detailed PM<INF>2.5</INF> air quality data and data on the chemical 
composition of PM<INF>2.5</INF> in different areas become available, the 
EPA will work with the 

[[Page 301]]

States to analyze regional strategies that could 
reduce PM<INF>2.5</INF> levels. If further cost-effective regional 
reductions will help areas meet the new standard, the EPA will encourage 
States to work together to use a cap-and-trade approach similar to that 
used to curb acid rain. This acid rain program delivered environmental 
benefits at a greatly reduced cost.
Given the regional dimensions of the PM<INF>2.5</INF> problem, local 
governments and local businesses should not be required to undertake 
unnecessary planning and local regulatory measures when the problem 
requires action on a regional basis. Therefore, as long as the States 
are doing their part to carry out regional reduction programs, the areas 
that would attain the PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards based on full 
implementation of the acid rain program would not face new local 
requirements. Early identification of other regional strategies could 
also assist local areas in completing their programs to attain the 
PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards after those areas have been designated 
nonattainment.
The EPA will also encourage States to coordinate their PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
control strategy development and efforts to protect regional visibility. 
Visibility monitoring and data analysis will support both PM<INF>2.5</INF> 
implementation and the visibility program.

Implementation of Revised PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS

In its rule, the EPA is revising the current set of PM<INF>10</INF> 
standards. Given that health effects from coarse particles are still of 
concern, the overall goal during this transition period is to ensure 
that PM<INF>10</INF> control measures remain in place to maintain the 
progress that has been achieved toward attainment of the current 
PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS (and which provides benefits for PM<INF>2.5</INF>) 
and protection of public health.
To ensure that this goal is met, the existing PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS will 
continue to apply until certain critical actions by the EPA, and by 
States and local agencies, have been taken to sustain the progress 
already made. For areas not attaining the existing PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS 
when the revised standards go into effect, those standards remain in 
effect until the EPA has completed a section 172(e) rulemaking to 
prevent backsliding. The EPA will propose this rulemaking in the Fall of 
1997. For areas attaining the existing PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS, the EPA 
will retain the existing PM<INF>10</INF> NAAQS until the State submits 
and the EPA approves the section 110 SIP which States are required to 
submit within 3 years of a NAAQS revision. Once those areas have an 
approved SIP, the EPA will take action so the standard no longer 
applies. In addition, the EPA will take action within 3 years to 
designate areas for the revised PM<INF>10</INF> standards.

Cost-Effective Implementation Strategies

There is a strong desire to drive the development of new technologies 
with the potential of greater emission reduction at less cost. It was 
agreed that $10,000 per ton of emission reduction is the high end of the 
range of reasonable cost to impose on sources. Consistent with the 
State's ultimate responsibility to attain the standards, the EPA will 
encourage the States to design strategies for attaining the PM and ozone 
standards that focus on getting low cost reductions and limiting the 
cost of control to under $10,000 per ton for all sources. Market-based 
strategies can be used to re-

[[Page 302]]

duce compliance costs. The EPA will 
encourage the use of concepts such as a Clean Air Investment Fund, which 
would allow sources facing control costs higher than $10,000 a ton for 
any of these pollutants to pay a set annual amount per ton to fund cost-
effective emissions reductions from non-traditional and small sources. 
Compliance strategies like this will likely lower the costs of attaining 
the standards through more efficient allocation, minimize the regulatory 
burden for small and large pollution sources, and serve to stimulate 
technology innovation as well.

Additional Future Activities and Coordination with Other Federal
Departments and Agencies

The approaches outlined above for implementation of the current and new 
ozone standards will be developed in the future in much greater detail. 
In order to ensure that the final details are practical, incorporate 
common sense, and provide the appropriate steps toward cleaning the air, 
input is needed from many stakeholders such as representatives of State 
and local governments, industry, environmental groups, and Federal 
agencies. The EPA will continue seeking such advice from a range of 
stakeholders and, after evaluating their input, propose the necessary 
guidance to make these approaches work. Moreover, the EPA will continue 
to work with a number of Federal agencies to ensure that those agencies 
comply with these new standards in cost-effective, common sense ways. 
The guidance and rules (e.g., revisions to NSR and conformity) will be 
completed by the end of 1998.
The EPA will continue to work with the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) because small businesses are particularly concerned about the 
potential impact resulting from future control measures to meet the 
revised PM and ozone standards. The EPA, in partnership with SBA, will 
work with the States to include in their SIPs flexible regulatory 
alternatives that minimize the economic impact and paperwork burden on 
small businesses to the greatest possible degree consistent with public 
health protection.
The EPA and the Department of Defense will continue to work towards 
assuring that the CAA's general conformity provisions are applied 
appropriately so as to maintain the air quality benefits of this 
requirement consistent with the Department's goals for cost-saving 
consolidation of the defense infrastructure and the economic viability 
for civilian use of former military bases, in support of base 
realignment and closure activities.
In addition, understanding that critical training using smoke and 
obscurants must continue to ensure the training and readiness of the 
military, the EPA will work with the Department of Defense to develop a 
policy that ensures that a local area will not be redesignated to 
nonattainment solely on the basis of the use of obscurants or smoke for 
such purposes. While there is a need to keep the public informed of 
violations of air quality standards, if any were to occur, there is no 
need to curtail the training or limit it to certain weather conditions.
The EPA will also work closely with the Department of Agriculture and 
the Agriculture Air Quality Task Force on any agricultural issues 
associated with the ozone and PM standards. By establishing new 
standards for particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in 
diameter (PM<INF>2.5</INF>), as opposed 

[[Page 303]]

to tightening the existing 
standards for particles smaller than 10 micrometers (PM<INF>10</INF>), 
the EPA is actually focusing regulatory attention away from farming and 
tilling issues. Indeed, soils and agriculture comprise a much smaller 
portion of the PM<INF>2.5</INF> problem than they do of the PM<INF>10</INF> 
problem. The EPA will issue guidance to the States to ensure that in 
meeting the PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards they focus their control 
strategies on sources of fine particles, rather than coarse particles 
(those particles larger than PM<INF>2.5</INF>).
Finally, the EPA will continue to work with the interagency group 
addressing fire and air quality issues. The EPA recognizes the 
inevitability of fire, and the important role of fire in natural 
systems. The interagency group will develop policies and practices to 
assure compatibility between fire and air quality programs consistent 
with public health, safety, and environmental protection.

Appendix 1

Interagency Research Program

The EPA has concluded that the current scientific knowledge provides a 
strong basis for the revised ozone and PM<INF>10</INF> standards and the 
new PM<INF>2.5</INF> standards. However, for both pollutants there exist 
uncertainties about the health effects and their causes that can benefit 
from further study. The complex chemistry of their formation and the 
potential for the regional transport of their precursor pollutants and 
ozone and PM also needs to be better understood to design effective 
control strategies to reduce their concentrations in the ambient air. 
The research program is structured to prioritize those projects that 
ensure research activities are focused on high-priority topics and that 
the research carried out by various agencies is both complementary and 
timely. The EPA will reach out to form partnerships with the private 
sector and State and local governments in performing the research 
wherever possible.

Particulate Matter Research

As discussed elsewhere, the EPA will complete another full scientific 
and technical review of the PM standards by 2002. Simultaneous with the 
planning for the current criteria review in 1993, the EPA began a 
process of increasing emphasis on PM research. As discussed above, 
commenters on the proposed PM NAAQS also expressed significant concerns 
about the science. The steps discussed below are intended to address the 
concerns raised by the commenters.
Based on the recently completed comprehensive scientific review, the EPA 
is again reassessing its research priorities to address the most recent 
understanding of these uncertainties with the development of two 
documents, entitled PM Research Needs for Human Health Risk Assessment 
and ORD PM Research Program Strategy. These documents are designed to 
highlight significant health research needs and EPA/ORD's strategy to 
address a subset of those needs as well as research needs for 
implementing the standards. Both documents were reviewed by the Clean 
Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) in a November 1996 meeting, 
and are currently undergoing revisions to address CASAC comments.
These documents, in turn, will help to guide an expansion of an ongoing 
government-wide effort to target and coordinate Federal research on 
particulate matter. The EPA, in partnership with other Federal agencies, 
will de-

[[Page 304]]

velop a greatly expanded coordinated interagency PM research 
program. The program will contribute to expanding the science associated 
with particulate matter health effects, as well as developing improved 
monitoring methods and cost-effective mitigation strategies. For 
example, the Department of Health and Human Services is conducting 
research on respiratory disease and could undertake surveillance of PM-
related health effects. Significant emphasis will be placed on 
coordinating research on health effects, biological mechanism causing 
effects, monitoring, source-receptor relationships, speciation of PM, 
identification of sources, control technologies and regional transport 
for particulate matter with corresponding research on ozone and other 
related pollutants including regional haze. To assist State and local 
efforts in completing planning requirements and reducing PM, the EPA 
will work cooperatively with the Department of Agriculture, Department 
of Defense, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and 
other affected Federal agencies to refine existing, limited analytical 
models for PM<INF>10</INF> and to develop new reliable predictive models 
for PM<INF>2.5</INF>.

Tropospheric (Ground Level) Ozone Research

To ensure that the ozone NAAQS and their implementation continue to be 
based on the best available science, the EPA will continue its research 
efforts on tropospheric or ground level ozone. As with the setting and 
implementation of virtually all health-based environmental standards, 
there remain scientific uncertainties associated with the effects of 
ozone and the means of reducing them. The EPA has participated in an 
intergovernmental public/private partnership called the North American 
Research Strategy for Tropospheric Ozone (NARSTO) that involves a 
coordinated effort to identify and address key issues in the emissions, 
transport, and mitigation of photochemical pollutants. Further, with the 
completion of the ozone Criteria Document, the EPA has reassessed the 
uncertainties and research needs on the health and ecological effects of 
ozone at workshops held in March and May 1997, respectively. The EPA is 
currently developing a health and ecological effects research needs 
document for ozone, which will be submitted for review by CASAC.
In addition, the EPA will continue broader efforts to coordinate Federal 
research on tropospheric ozone. The public/private NARSTO partnership is 
a model cooperative effort already begun in the area of atmospheric 
processes and risk management. NARSTO's membership spans government, 
utilities and other industries, and the academic community--all 
following a single national research agenda. The EPA will also work in 
partnership with other Federal agencies to address research needs on 
ozone health and ecological effects. For example, the Department of 
Health and Human Services is conducting research on respiratory disease 
and could undertake surveillance of ozone-related health effects. These 
research efforts will be coordinated to ensure research activities are 
focused on high-priority topics and that the research carried out by 
various agencies is complementary. Significant emphasis will be placed 
on coordinating both health effects, monitoring, source-receptor, and 
control technologies for ozone with corresponding research on 
particulate matter and other related pollutants subject to significant 
regional transport.

Notice of July 31, 1997

Continuation of Iraqi Emergency

On August 2, 1990, by Executive Order 12722, President Bush declared a 
national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by 
the actions and policies of the Government of Iraq. By Executive Orders 
12722 of August 2, 1990, and 12724 of August 9, 1990, the President 
imposed trade sanctions on Iraq and blocked Iraqi government assets. 
Because the Government of Iraq has continued its activities hostile to 
United States interests in the Middle East, the national emergency 
declared on August 2, 1990, and the measures adopted on August 2 and 
August 9, 1990, to deal with that emergency must continue in effect 
beyond August 2, 1997. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the 
national emergency with respect to Iraq.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Notice of September 24, 1997

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to UNITA

On September 26, 1993, by Executive Order 12865, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
(``UNITA''), prohibiting the sale or supply by United States persons or 
from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of 
arms and related material of all types, and petroleum and petroleum 
products to the territory of Angola, other than through designated 
points of entry. The order also prohibits the sale or supply of such 
commodities to UNITA. Because of our continuing international 
obligations and because of the prejudicial effect that discontinuation 
of the sanctions would have on the Angolan peace process, the national 
emergency declared on September 26, 1993, and the measures adopted 
pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect 
beyond September 26, 1997. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) 
of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the 
national emergency with respect to UNITA.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 97-35 of September 26, 1997

Presidential Determination on Classified Information Concerning the Air 
Force's Operating Location Near Groom Lake, Nevada

Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency [and] the Secretary of the Air Force

I find that it is in the paramount interest of the United States to 
exempt the United States Air Force's operating location near Groom Lake, 
Nevada (the subject of litigation in Kasza v. Browner (D. Nev. CV-S-94-
795-PMP) and Frost v. Perry (D. Nev. CV-S-94-714-PMP)), from any 
applicable requirement for the disclosure to unauthorized persons of 
classified information concerning that operating location. Therefore, 
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6961(a), I hereby exempt the Air Force's operating 
location near Groom Lake, Nevada, from any Federal, State, interstate, 
or local provision respecting control and abatement of solid waste or 
hazardous waste disposal that would require the disclosure of classified 
information concerning that operating location to any unauthorized 
person. This exemption shall be effective for the full one-year 
statutory period.
Nothing herein is intended to: (a) imply that in the absence of such a 
Presidential exemption, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
(RCRA) or any other provision of law permits or requires disclosure of 
classified information to unauthorized persons; or (b) limit the 
applicability or enforcement of any requirement of law applicable to the 
Air Force's operating location near Groom Lake, Nevada, except those 
provisions, if any, that would require the disclosure of classified 
information.
The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized and directed to publish 
this determination in the Federal Register.

Notice of September 30, 1997

Continuation of Iran Emergency

On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a 
national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the 
situation in Iran. Notices of the continuation of this national 
emergency have been transmitted annually by the President to the 
Congress and the Federal Register. The most recent notice appeared in 
the Federal Register on October 31, 1996. Because our relations with 
Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing 
the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is still underway, the 
national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, must continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 1997. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 

[[Page 312]]

1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran. 
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Assistance Act, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

In accordance with section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(``the Act'') (8 U.S.C. 1157), as amended, and after appropriate 
consultation with the Congress, I hereby make the following 
determinations and authorize the following actions:

The admission of up to 83,000 refugees to the United States during FY 
1998 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the 
national interest; provided, however, that this number shall be 
understood as including persons admitted to the United States during FY 

[[Page 313]]

1998 with Federal refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian 
immigrant admissions program, as provided below.

The 83,000 admissions shall be allocated among refugees of special 
humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the 
following regional allocations; provided, however, that the number 
allocated to the East Asia region shall include persons admitted to the 
United States during FY 1998 with Federal refugee resettlement 
assistance under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988, as contained 
in section 101(e) of Public Law 100-202 (Amerasian immigrants and their 
family members); provided further that the number allocated to the 
former Soviet Union shall include persons admitted who were nationals of 
the former Soviet Union, or in the case of persons having no 
nationality, who were habitual residents of the former Soviet Union, 
prior to September 2, 1991:

                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
      Africa...........................................    7,000

Within the Europe ceiling are 5,000 unfunded reserve numbers allocated 
to the former Soviet Union for use as needed provided that resources 
within existing appropriations are available to fund the cost of their 
admission. The 3,000 unfunded unallocated numbers shall be allocated as 
needed if resources within existing appropriations are available to fund 
the cost of their admission. Unused admissions numbers allocated to a 
particular region within the 75,000 federally funded ceiling may be 
transferred to one or more other regions if there is an overriding need 
for greater numbers for the region or regions to which the numbers are 
being transferred. You are hereby authorized and directed to consult 
with the Judiciary Committees of the Congress prior to any such use of 
the unallocated numbers or reallocation of numbers from one region to 
another.

Pursuant to section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act 
of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(b)(2), I hereby determine that 
assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for admission to the 
United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will 
contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States and 
designate such persons for this purpose.

An additional 10,000 refugee admissions numbers shall be made available 
during FY 1998 for the adjustment to permanent resident status under 
section 209(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1159(b)) 
of aliens who have been granted asylum in the United States under 
section 208 of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1158), as this is justified by 
humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.

In accordance with section 101(a)(42)(B) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 
1101(a)(42)) and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I 
also specify that, for FY 1998, the following persons may, if otherwise 
qualified, be considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the 
United States within their countries of nationality or habitual 
residence:
    a. Persons in Vietnam

Notice of October 17, 1997

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to Significant Narcotics 
Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions of significant foreign narcotics traffickers 
centered in Colombia, and the unparalleled violence, corruption, and 
harm that they cause in the United States and abroad. The order blocks 
all property and interests in property of foreign persons listed in an 
Annex to the order, as well as foreign persons determined to play a 
significant role in international narcotics trafficking centered in 
Colombia, to materially assist in, or provide financial or technological 
support for or goods or services in support of, the nar-

[[Page 317]]

cotics trafficking activities of persons designated in or pursuant to the 
order, or to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, 
persons designated in or pursuant to the order. The order also prohibits 
any transaction or dealing by United States persons or within the United 
States in such property or interests in property. Because the activities 
of significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to 
threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States and to cause unparalleled violence, corruption, and harm 
in the United States and abroad, the national emergency declared on 
October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 21, 1997. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency for 1 
year with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

    October 17, 1997.



Memorandum of November 4, 1997

Authorization To Redelegate Certain Responsibilities Vested in the 
President and Delegated to the Secretary of State

Memorandum for the Secretary of State

By the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, including section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, to 
the extent that you consider doing so appropriate to facilitate the 
consolidation of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the 
Department of State, I hereby authorize you to redelegate to any officer 
of the executive branch any or all authorities vested in the President 
that are delegated to the Secretary of State by any act, order, 
determination, delegation of authority, regulation, or Executive order 
heretofore or hereinafter enacted or issued and that have been or may be 
redelegated to the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and 
International Security Affairs.
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the

Notice of November 12, 1997

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons 
(``weapons of mass destruction'') and the means of delivering such 
weapons. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and 
the means of delivering them continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
November 14, 1994, and extended on November 14, 1995 and November 14, 
1996, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 1997. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency declared in 
Executive Order 12938.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

                      Subpart A--General Standards


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-1  Purpose and scope.

    (a) The maintenance of the highest standards of honesty, integrity, 
impartiality, and conduct by regular employees and special Government 
employees is essential to assure the proper performance of Government 
business and the maintenance of confidence by citizens in their 
Government. The avoidance of misconduct and conflicts of interest on the 
part of regular employees and special Government employees through 
informed judgment is indispensable to the maintenance of these 
standards.
    (b) This part is intended to foster the foregoing concepts. It is 
issued in compliance with the requirements of Executive Order No. 11222 
of May 8, 1965, and is based upon the provisions of that order, the 
regulations of the Civil Service Commission issued thereunder (part 735 
of 5 CFR Ch. I), and the statutes cited elsewhere in this part.
    (c) This part, among other things reflects prohibitions and 
requirements imposed by the criminal and civil laws of the United 
States. However, the paraphrased restatements of criminal and civil 
statutes contained in this part are designed for informational purposes 
only and in no way constitute an interpretation or construction thereof 
that is binding upon the Federal Government. Moreover, this part does 
not purport to paraphrase or enumerate all restrictions or requirements 
imposed by statutes, Executive Orders, regulations or otherwise upon 
Federal employees and former Federal employees. The omission of a 
reference to any such restriction or requirement in no way alters the 
legal effect of that restriction or requirement and any such restriction 
or requirement, as the case may be, continues to be applicable to 
employees and former employees in accordance with its own terms. 
Furthermore, attorneys employed by an agency are subject to the canons 
of professional ethics of the American Bar Association.

<R05>

subpart relating to employees are applicable also to special Government 
employees.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-4  General standards of conduct.

    (a) All employees shall conduct themselves on the job in such a 
manner that the work of their agency is efficiently accomplished and 
courtesy, consideration, and promptness are observed in dealings with 
the Congress, the public, and other governmental agencies.
    (b) All employees shall conduct themselves off the job in such a 
manner as not to reflect adversely upon their agency or the Federal 
service.
    (c) In all circumstances employees shall conduct themselves so as to 
exemplify the highest standards of integrity. An employee shall avoid 
any action, whether or not specifically prohibited by this subpart, 
which might result in, or create the appearance of:
    (1) Using public office for private gain;
    (2) Giving preferential treatment to any person;
    (3) Impeding Government efficiency or economy;
    (4) Losing complete independence or impartiality;
    (5) Making a Government decision outside official channels; or
    (6) Affecting adversely the confidence of the public in the

<R05>
Sec. 100.735-5  Responsibilities of employees.

    (a) The Executive Clerk for the White House Office and the Counselor 
for each other agency shall distribute copies of this subpart to each 
employee and special Government employee within 30 days after the 
effective date thereof. In the case of a new employee or special

distribution, a copy shall be furnished at the time of his entrance on 
duty. All employees and special Government employees shall familiarize 
themselves with the contents of this subpart.
    (b) Copies of Executive Order 11222, regulations, and statutes 
referred to in Sec. 100.735-1, together with various explanatory 
materials are available for inspection in the Office of the Executive 
Clerk for the White House Office and the Counselor for each other agency 
at any time during regular business 

[[Page 328]]

hours. Employees are encouraged to 
consult these basic materials in any case of doubt as to the proper 
application or interpretation of the provisions of this subpart.
    (c) Attention of all employees is directed to House Concurrent 
Resolution 175, 85th Congress, 2d session, 72 Stat. B12, the ``Code of 
Ethics for Government Service'', which is attached to this subpart as 
Appendix A.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-6  Interpretation and advisory service; counseling.

    (a) The agency head shall appoint a Counselor for the agency who 
shall serve also as the agency's designee to the Civil Service 
Commission on matters covered by this part. Communications between the 
Counselor and employee shall be confidential, except as otherwise 
determined by the agency head.
    (b) The Counselor for the agency shall notify all employees and 
special Government employees of the availability of counseling services, 
and of how and where such services are available. Such notification 
shall be made within 90 days after the effective date of this subpart 
and periodically thereafter. In the case of a new employee or special 
Government employee appointed after the date of such notification, 
notification shall be given at the time of his entrance on duty.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-7  Disciplinary action.

    (a) A violation of any provision of this subpart by an employee may 
be cause for appropriate disciplinary action which may be in addition to 
any penalties prescribed by law. (As to remedial action in cases where 
an employee's financial interests result in a conflict or apparent 
conflict of interest, see Sec. 100.735-26.)
    (b) Any disciplinary or remedial action taken pursuant to this 
subpart shall be effected in accordance with any applicable laws, 
Executive orders, and regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-8  Conflicts of interest.

    (a) A conflict of interest may exist whenever an employee has a 
substantial personal or private interest in a matter which involves his 
duties and responsibilities as an employee. The maintenance of public 
confidence in Government clearly demands that an employee take no action 
which would constitute the use of his official position to advance his 
personal or private interest. It is equally important that each employee 
avoid becoming involved in situations which present the possibility, or 
even the appearance, that his official position might be used to his 
private advantage.
    (b) Neither the pertinent statutes nor the standards of conduct 
prescribed in this subpart are to be regarded as entirely comprehensive. 
Each employee must, in each instance involving a personal or private 
interest in a matter which also involves his duties and responsibilities 
as an employee, make certain that his actions do not have the effect or 
the appearance of the use of his official position for the furtherance 
of his own interests or those of his family or his business associates.
    (c) The principal statutory provisions relating to bribery, graft, 
and conflicts of interest are contained in Chapter 11 of the Criminal 
Code, 18 U.S.C. 201-224. Severe penalties are provided for violations, 
including variously fine, imprisonment, dismissal from office, and 
disqualification from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit 
under the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 100.735-9  Disqualification because of private financial interests.

    (a) Unless authorized to do so as provided hereafter in this 
section, no employee shall participate personally and substantially as a 
Government employee in a particular matter in which to his knowledge he 
has a financial interest (18 U.S.C. 208).
    (1) For the purposes of this section--
    (i) An employee participates personally and substantially in a 
particular matter through decision, approval, disapproval, 
recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise;
    (ii) A particular matter is a judicial or other proceeding, 
application, request for ruling or other determination, contract, claim, 
controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter; and
    (iii) A financial interest is the interest of the employee himself 
or his 

[[Page 329]]

spouse, minor child, partner, organization in which he is serving 
as officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment.
    (b) An employee who has a financial interest (other than a financial 
interest exempted under paragraph (c) of this section) in a particular 
matter which is within the scope of his official duties shall make a 
full disclosure of that interest to the Counselor for the agency in 
writing. He shall not participate in such matter unless and until he 
receives a written determination by the agency head pursuant to section 
208 of Title 18, United States Code, that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect of him. If the agency head does 
not make such a determination he shall direct such remedial action as 
may be appropriate under the provisions of Sec. 100.735-26.
    (c) The financial interests described in this paragraph are hereby 
exempted pursuant to the provisions of section 208 of Title 18, United 
States Code, from the restrictions of paragraph (a) of this section and 
of section 208 of Title 18 as being too remote or inconsequential to 
affect the integrity of an employee's services in a matter.
    (1) Stocks, bonds, policies, properties, or interests in a mutual 
fund, investment company, trust, bank, or insurance company, as to which 
the employee has no managerial control or directorship. In the case of a 
mutual fund or investment company, this exemption applies only where the 
assets of the fund or company are diversified; it does not apply where 
the fund or company advertises that it specializes in a particular 
industry or commodity.
    (2) Interest in an investment club: Provided, That the fair value of 
the interest involved does not exceed $5,000, and that the interest does 
not exceed one-fourth of the total assets of the investment club.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-10  Additional prohibitions--regular employees.

    (a) In addition to the disqualification described in Sec. 100.735-9, 
a regular employee is subject to the following major prohibitions.
    (1) He may not, except in the discharge of his official duties, 
represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a matter in 
which the United States is a party or has an interest. This prohibition 
applies both to paid and unpaid representation of another (18 U.S.C. 203 
and 205).
    (2) He may not, after his Government employment has ended, represent 
anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which 
the United States is a party or has an interest and in which he 
participated personally and substantially for the Government (18 U.S.C. 
207(a)).
    (3) He may not, for 1 year after his Government employment has 
ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with 
a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and 
which was within the boundaries of his official responsibility during 
the last year of his Government service (18 U.S.C. 207(b)). (This 
temporary restraint is permanent if the matter is one in which he 
participated personally and substantially. See subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph.)
    (4) He may not receive any salary, or supplementation of his 
Government salary, from a private source as compensation for his 
services to the Government (18 U.S.C. 209). (See Sec. 100.735-13.)
    (b) Exemptions or exceptions from the prohibitions described in 
paragraph (a) of this section are permitted under certain circumstances. 
For the method of obtaining such exemptions or exceptions, see paragraph 
(d) of Sec. 100.735-12.

<R05>
Sec. 100.735-11  Additional prohibitions--special Government employees.

    (a) In addition to the disqualification described in Sec. 100.735-9, 
a special Government employee is subject to the following major 
prohibitions.
    (1) He may not, except in the discharge of his official duties--
    (i) Represent anyone else before a court or Government agency in a 
matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and in 
which he has at any time participated personally and substantially for 
the Government (18 U.S.C. 203 and 205), or

[[Page 330]]

    (ii) Represent anyone else in a matter pending before his agency 
unless he served there no more than 60 days during the previous 365 (18 
U.S.C. 203 and 205). He is bound by this restraint despite the fact that 
the matter is not one in which he has ever participated personally and 
substantially.
    (2) He may not, after his Government employment has ended, represent 
anyone other than the United States in connection with a matter in which 
the United States is a party or has an interest and in which he 
participated personally and substantially for the Government (18 U.S.C. 
207(a)).
    (3) He may not, for 1 year after his Government employment has 
ended, represent anyone other than the United States in connection with 
a matter in which the United States is a party or has an interest and 
which was within the boundaries of his official responsibility during 
the last year of his Government service (18 U.S.C. 207(b)). (This 
temporary restraint is permanent if the matter is one in which he 
participated personally and substantially. See subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph.)
    (b) Exemptions or exceptions from the prohibitions described in 
paragraph (a) of this section are permitted under certain circumstances; 
for the method of obtaining such exemptions or exceptions, see paragraph 
(d) of Sec. 100.735-12.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-12  Exemptions and exceptions from prohibitions of conflict of interest statutes.

    (a) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an employee, 
if it is not otherwise inconsistent with the faithful performance of his 
duties, from acting without compensation as agent or attorney for any 
person in a disciplinary, loyalty, or other Federal personnel 
administration proceeding involving such person.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an employee 
from acting, with or without compensation, as agent or attorney for his 
parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or for any estate for 
which, he is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee or 
other personal fiduciary, except in those matters in which he has 
participated personally and substantially as a Government employee, 
through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the rendering 
of advice, investigation, or otherwise, or which are the subject of his 
official responsibility, as defined in section 202(b) of Title 18 of the 
United States Code, provided that the agency head approves.
    (c) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an employee 
from giving testimony under oath or from making statements required to 
be made under penalty for perjury or contempt.
    (d) In addition to the exemptions and exceptions described in this 
section and in Sec. 100.735-9, the conflict of interest statutes permit 
certain exemptions and exceptions in specific circumstances. The 
procedure for effecting such exemptions or exceptions is as follows:
    (1) Any regular employee or special Government employee who desires 
approval or certification of his activities as provided for by section 
205 of Title 18, United States Code, shall make application therefor in 
writing to the Counselor for the agency.
    (2) A former employee, including a former special Government 
employee, who desires certification with regard to his activities under 
section 207 of Title 18, United States Code, shall make application 
therefor in writing to the Counselor for the agency.
    (3) The Counselor for the agency shall report promptly to the agency 
head all matters reported to him under this subpart which require 
consideration of approvals, certifications, or determinations provided 
for in sections 205, 207, or 208 of Title 18, United States Code.

<R05>
Sec. 100.735-13  Salary of employee payable only by United States.

    (a) No employee, other than a special Government employee or an 
employee serving without compensation, shall receive any salary, or any 
contribution to or supplementation of salary, as compensation for his 
services as an employee, from any source other than the Government of 
the United States, except as may be contributed out of the treasury of 
any State, county, or municipality (18 U.S.C. 209).
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an employee 
from 

[[Page 331]]

continuing to participate in a bona fide pension, retirement, group 
life, health, or accident insurance, profit-sharing, stock bonus, or 
other employee welfare or benefit plan maintained by a former employer 
nor from accepting contributions, awards, or other expenses under 
Chapter 41 of Title 5, United States Code (the former Government 
Employees Training Act).


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-14  Gifts, entertainment, and favors.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an employee 
shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, 
favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value from a 
person who:
    (1) Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or 
financial relations with his agency;
    (2) Conducts operations or activities which are regulated by his 
agency; or
    (3) Has interests which may be substantially affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of his official duty.
    (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an employee may:
    (1) Accept a gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or other 
thing of monetary value from a friend, parent, spouse, child, or other 
close relative when the circumstances make it clear that the family or 
personal relationships involved are the motivating factors;
    (2) Accept food or refreshments of nominal value on infrequent 
occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or 
other meeting or on an inspection tour whom an employee may properly be 
in attendance;
    (3) Accept loans from banks or other financial institutions on 
customary terms to finance proper or usual activities of employees, such 
as home mortgage loans; and
    (4) Accept unsolicited advertising or promotional materials such as 
pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, or other items of nominal intrinsic 
value.
    (c) An employee shall not solicit contributions from another 
employee for a gift to an employee in a superior official position. An 
employee in a superior official position shall not accept a gift 
presented as a contribution from employees receiving less salary than 
himself. An employee shall not make a donation as a gift to an employee 
in a superior official position (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph 
does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a 
nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness or 
retirement.
    (d) The Constitution (Art. 1, sec. 9, par. 8) prohibits acceptance 
from foreign governments, except with the consent of Congress, of any 
emolument, office, or title. The Congress has provided for the receipt 
and disposition of foreign gifts and decorations in 5 U.S.C. 7342. See 
also Executive Order 11320, 31 FR 15789, and the regulations pursuant 
thereto in 22 CFR part 3 (as added, 32 FR 6569). Any such gift or thing 
which cannot appropriately be refused shall be submitted to the 
Counselor for transmittal to the State Department.

<R05>
Sec. 100.735-15  Outside employment and other activity.

    (a) An employee shall not engage in outside employment or other 
outside activity not compatible with the full and proper discharge of 
the duties and responsibilities of his Government employment. 
Incompatible activities include, but are not limited to:
    (1) Acceptance of a fee, compensation, gift, payment of expense, or 
any other thing of monetary value in circumstances in which acceptance 
may result in, or create the appearance of, a conflict of interest; or
    (2) Outside employment which tends to impair the employee's mental 
or physical capacity to perform his Government duties and 
responsibilities in an acceptable manner.
    (b) Within the limitations imposed by this section, employees are 
encouraged to engage in teaching, lecturing, and writing. However, an 
employee shall not, either for or without compensation, engage in 
teaching, lecturing, or writing that is dependent on information 
obtained as a result of his Government employment, except when that 
information has been made available to the general public or will be 
made available on request, or when the agency head gives written 
authorization for the use of non-public information on the basis that 
the use is in the 

[[Page 332]]

public interest. In addition, an employee who is a 
Presidential appointee covered by section 401(a) of Executive Order No. 
11222 of May 8, 1965, shall not receive compensation or anything of 
monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or 
appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the 
responsibilities, programs, or operations of his agency, or which draws 
substantially on official data or ideas which have not become part of 
the body of public information.
    (c) An employee shall not engage in outside employment under a State 
or local government, except in accordance with applicable regulations of 
the Civil Service Commission (part 734 of 5 CFR Ch. I).
    (d) Neither this section nor Sec. 100.735-14 precludes an employee 
from:
    (1) Receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, 
for actual expenses for travel and such other necessary subsistence as 
is compatible with this subpart and for which no Government payment or 
reimbursement is made. However, an employee may not be reimbursed, and 
payment may not be made on his behalf, for excessive personal living 
expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it 
allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official 
business under agency orders when reimbursement is proscribed by 
Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.
    (2) Participation in the activities of national or State political 
parties not proscribed by law. (See paragraph (o) of Sec. 100.735-22 
regarding proscribed political activities.)
    (3) Participation in the affairs of, or acceptance of an award for a 
meritorious public contribution or achievement given by, a charitable, 
religious, professional, social, fraternal, nonprofit educational or 
recreational, public service, or civic organization.
    (e) An employee who intends to engage in outside employment shall 
obtain the approval, through his official superior, of his agency head. 
A record of each approval under this paragraph shall be filed in the 
employee's official personnel folder.
    (f) This section does not apply to special Government employees, who 
are subject to the provisions of Sec. 100.735-23.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-16  Financial interests.

    (a) An employee may not have financial interests which--
    (1) Establish a substantial personal or private interest in a matter 
which involves his duties and responsibilities as an employee (an 
employee may not have financial interests, except as permitted by 
Sec. 100.735-9(c) or authorized pursuant to Sec. 100.735-12(d); or
    (2) Are entered into in reliance upon, or as a result of, 
information obtained through his employment; or
    (3) Result from active and continuous trading (as distinguished from 
the making of bona fide investments) which is conducted on such a scale 
as to interfere with the proper performance of his duties.
    (b) Aside from the restrictions prescribed or cited in this subpart, 
employees are free to engage in lawful financial transactions to the 
same extent as private citizens. Employees should be aware that the 
financial interests of their wives of minor children and blood relatives 
who are full-time residents of their households may be regarded, for the 
purposes of this section, as financial interests of the employees 
themselves.
    (c) This section does not apply to special Government employees, who 
are subject to the provisions of Sec. 100.735-23.


<R05>
Sec. 100.735-17  Use of Government property.

    An employee shall not directly or indirectly use, or allow the use 
of, Government property of any kind, including property leased to the

    For the purpose of furthering a private interest, an employee shall

Sec. 100.735-19  Indebtedness.

    An employee shall pay each just financial obligation in a proper and 
timely manner, especially one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or 
local taxes. For the purpose of this section, a just financial

judgment by a court, and in a proper and timely manner means in a manner 
which his agency determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect 
adversely on the Government as his employer. In the event of dispute 
between an employee and an alleged creditor, this section does not 
require an agency to determine the validity or amount of the disputed 
debt.

    (a) A special Government employee shall not use his Government

    (b) A special Government employee shall not use inside information 
obtained as a result of his Government employment for private gain for 
himself or another person whether by direct action on his part or by 
counsel, recommendation, or suggestion to another person, particularly 
one with whom he has family, business, or financial ties. For the 
purposes of this section, inside information means information obtained 
under Government authority which has not become part of the body of 
public information.
    (c) A special Government employee who engages in teaching, 
lecturing, or writing, whether for or without compensation, shall not 
for such purposes make use of information obtained as a result of his 
Government employment, except when that information has been made 
available to the general public or will be made available on request, or 
when the agency head gives written authorization for the use of 
nonpublic information on the basis that such use is in the public 
interest.
    (d) A special Government employee shall not use his Government 
employment to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, a person to 
provide financial benefit to himself or another person, particularly one 
with whom he has family, business, or financial ties.

Government employee shall be allowed the same latitude as is authorized 
for regular Government employees by paragraph (b) of Sec. 100.735-14.
    (g) Attention of special Government employees is directed to the 
provisions of Sec. 100.735-3, making the provisions of this subpart

    (a) Not later than 90 days after the effective date of this subpart, 
an employee designated in paragraph (d) of this section shall submit to 
his agency head a statement, on a form made available in the office of 
the Executive Clerk for the White House Office and the Counselor for 
each other agency, setting forth the following information:
    (1) A list of the names of all corporations, companies, firms, or 
other business enterprises, partnerships, nonprofit organizations, and 
educational or other institutions with or in which he, his spouse, minor 
child or other member of his immediate household has--

trustee, partner, adviser or consultant; or
    (ii) Any continuing financial interest, through a pension or 
retirement plan, shared income, or other arrangement as a result of any 
current or prior employment or business or professional association; or
    (iii) Any financial interest through the ownership of stock, stock 
options, bonds, securities, or other arrangements including trusts.
    However, an employee need not report any financial interest exempted 
under Sec. 100.735-9(c) as too remote or inconsequential to affect the 
integrity of an employee's services in a matter.
    (2) A list of the names of his creditors and the creditors of his 
spouse, minor child or other member of his immediate household, other 
than those creditors to whom they may be indebted by reason of a 
mortgage on property which he occupies as a personal residence or to 
whom they may be indebted for current and ordinary household and living 
expenses such as 

[[Page 335]]

those incurred for household furnishings, an 
automobile, education, vacations, or the like.
    (3) A list of his interests and those of his spouse, minor child or 
other member of his immediate household in real property or rights in 
lands, other than property which he occupies as a personal residence.
    (b) For the purpose of this section member of his immediate 
household means a full-time resident of the employee's household who is 
related to him by blood.
    (c) Each employee designated in paragraph (d) of this section who 
enters on duty after the effective date of this subpart shall submit 
such statement not later than 30 days after the date of his entrance on 
duty, but not earlier than 90 days after the effective date of this 
subpart.
    (d) Statements of employment and financial interests are required of 
the following:
    (1) Employees paid at a level of the Executive Schedule in 
subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code, except a 
Presidential appointee required to file a statement of financial 
interests under section 401 of Executive Order No. 11222 of May 8, 1965.
    (2) Employees in classified positions of grade GS-13 or above, or 
the equivalent thereof.
    (e) Changes in, or additions to, the information contained in an 
employee's statement of employment and financial interests shall be 
reported in a supplementary statement as of June 30 each year. If no 
changes or additions occur, a negative report is required. 
Notwithstanding the filing of the annual report required by this 
paragraph, each employee shall at all times avoid acquiring a financial 
interest that could result, or taking an action that would result, in a 
violation of the conflicts-of-interest provisions of 18 U.S.C. 208 or 
this subpart.
    (f) If any information required to be included on a statement of 
employment and financial interests or supplementary statement, including 
holdings placed in trust, is not known to the employee but is known to 
another person, the employee shall request that other person to submit 
the information in his behalf.
    (g) Paragraph (a) of this section does not require an employee to 
submit any information relating to his connection with, or interest in, 
a professional society or a charitable, religious, social, fraternal, 
recreational, public service, civic, or political organization or a 
similar organization not conducted as a business enterprise. For the 
purpose of this section, educational and other institutions doing 
research and development or related work involving grants of money from 
or contracts with the Government are deemed ``business enterprises'' and 
are required to be included in an employee's statement of employment and 
financial interests.
    (h) Each agency shall hold each statement of employment and 
financial interests in confidence. Each person designated to review a 
statement of employment and financial interests under section 100.735-26 
is responsible for maintaining the statement in confidence and shall not 
allow access to, or allow information to be disclosed from, a statement 
except to carry out the purpose of this subpart. An agency may not 
disclose information from a statement except as the Civil Service 
Commission or the agency head may determine for good cause shown.
    (i) The statements of employment and financial interests and 
supplementary statements required of employees are in addition to, and 
not in substitution for, or in derogation of, any similar requirement 
imposed by law, order, or regulation. The submission of a statement by 
an employee does not permit him or any other person to participate in a 
matter in which his or the other person's participation is prohibited by 
law, order, or regulation.
    (j) An employee who believes that his position has been improperly 
included as one requiring the submission of a statement of employment 
and financial interests is entitled to obtain a review of his complaint 
under his agency's grievance procedure.
    (k) This section does not apply to special Government employees, who 
are subject to the provisions of Sec. 100.735-25.

interests of the employee or special Government employee concerned and 
the performance of his service for the Government. If the designee

or appearance of conflict. If he concludes that remedial action should 
be taken, he shall refer the statement to the agency head through the 
Counselor for the agency designated pursuant to Sec. 100.735-6, with his 
recommendation for such action. The agency head, after consideration of 
the employee's explanation and such investigation as he deems

to, delegations of any authority allowed by law pertaining to the 
functions placed upon the agency head by this subpart. Such regulations 
or instructions must be made available to employees and special

or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may

on the basis of handicap--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to

opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to 
reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to

others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.
    (2) The agency may not deny a qualified individual with handicaps

to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish 
requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified

29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 102.141--102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.

<R05>
Sec. 102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant 

[[Page 342]]

historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with 
handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property 
is not required because of Sec. 102.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;

[[Page 343]]

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this 
section.

Sec. 102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.

[[Page 344]]

Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).

Executive Office of the President, shall be responsible for coordinating 
implementation of this section. Complaints may be sent to the Director 
at the following address: Room 486, Old Executive Office Building, 17th 
and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed 
within 180 days of the alleged act of discrimination. The agency may 
extend this time period for good cause.
    (e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have 
jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which 
it has jurisdiction, the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the investigation in a letter containing--
    (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
    (2) A description of a remedy for each violation found; and
    (3) A notice of the right to appeal.
    (h) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or 
remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90 days of receipt from 
the agency of the letter required by Sec. 102.170(g). The agency may 
extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint 
investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for
