                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2007), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2006 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2006 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 7859 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2006 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2007, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
     statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
 Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

             This book was prepared in the Presidential and Legislative 
     Publications Unit under the supervision of Gwendolyn J. Henderson. 
          Stephen J. Frattini and Kathleen M. Fargey were Chief Editors.

<R05>
Proclamation 7973 of January 13, 2006

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As we observe the 20th anniversary of the Martin Luther King, Jr., 
Federal Holiday, we reflect on the history of civil rights in America 
and honor Dr. King for the power of his intellect, the truth of his 
words, and the example of his courage. Dr. King created a powerful and 
enduring legacy for all Americans by calling upon our Nation to ensure 
equal justice under law and uphold our founding ideals of life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness for all people.
Dr. King became an active leader in the civil rights movement in the 
1950s, strengthened in his resolve by the quiet courage of Rosa Parks' 
refusal to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus. He advocated 
non-violent action as a means to overcome the evil of racism in America, 
and he led the effort that resulted in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Dr. 
King later said that the legislation was the work of every citizen who 
took to the streets and marched for justice and equality. The Voting 
Rights Act, which became law the next year, guaranteed all citizens the 
right to vote, regardless of race, and helped our country realize the 
promise of the 15th Amendment to our Constitution.
Dr. King believed that all people are made in God's image and created 
equal. He dedicated his life to empowering people, no matter their 
circumstances, and challenged them to lift up their neighbors and 
communities. He broke down barriers within our society by encouraging 
Americans to look past their differences and refused to rest until our 
Nation fulfilled its pledge of liberty and justice for all.

[[Page 2]]

As we observe and honor Dr. King's birthday, we are reminded that great 
causes often involve great sacrifices. In the five decades since Dr. 
King and Mrs. Parks stood together in Montgomery, Alabama, our country 
has made great progress toward equality for every citizen. Yet more work 
remains. In the words of Dr. King, ``We will not be satisfied until 
`justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.' 
''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 16, 2006, 
as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all 
Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and 
service programs and activities in honor of the memory and legacy of Dr. 
King.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.
GEORGE W. BUSH


<R05>
Proclamation 7974 of January 13, 2006

Religious Freedom Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The right to religious freedom is a foundation of America. On Religious 
Freedom Day, our Nation celebrates the passage of the 1786 Virginia 
Statute for Religious Freedom and the protection of religious freedom in 
the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Our Founding Fathers knew the importance of freedom of religion to a 
stable democracy, and our Constitution protects individuals' rights to 
worship as they choose. We reject religious discrimination in every 
form, and we continue our efforts to oppose prejudice and to counter any 
infringements on religious freedom.
Today, we are also working to advance freedom of religion abroad. The 
Department of State's Office of International Religious Freedom plays an 
important role in these efforts, advocating for religious freedom and 
actively working against religious persecution around the world. In 
recent years, we have seen important progress, including in Vietnam, 
Laos, India, Georgia, and the United Arab Emirates, and with the release 
of many individuals in countries throughout the world who had been 
imprisoned because of their faith. By helping to secure the religious 
freedom of people in other countries, we promote the spread of liberty 
and human dignity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2006, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I call on all Americans to reflect on the great 
blessing of religious liberty, endeavor to preserve this freedom for

activities in their schools, places of worship, neighborhoods, and 
homes.

Proclamation 7975 of January 20, 2006

National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation was founded on the belief that every human being has rights, 
dignity, and value. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we 
underscore our commitment to building a culture of life where all 
individuals are welcomed in life and protected in law.
America is making great strides in our efforts to protect human life. 
One of my first actions as President was to sign an order banning the 
use of taxpayer money on programs that promote abortion overseas. Over 
the past 5 years, I also have been proud to sign into law the Born-Alive 
Infants Protection Act, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, and a ban on 
partial-birth abortion. In addition, my Administration continues to fund 
abstinence and adoption programs and numerous faith-based and community 
initiatives that support these efforts.
When we seek to advance science and improve our lives, we must always 
preserve human dignity and remember that human life is a gift from our 
Creator. We must not sanction the creation of life only to destroy it. 
America must pursue the tremendous possibilities of medicine and 
research and at the same time remain an ethical and compassionate 
society.
National Sanctity of Human Life Day is an opportunity to strengthen our 
resolve in creating a society where every life has meaning and our most 
vulnerable members are protected and defended--including unborn 
children, the sick and dying, and persons with disabilities and birth 
defects. This is an ideal that appeals to the noblest and most generous 
instincts within us, and this is the America we will achieve by working 
together.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, January 22, 2006, 
as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. I call upon all Americans to 
recognize this day with appropriate ceremonies and to reaffirm our 
commitment to respecting and defending the life and dignity of every 
human being.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7976 of January 27, 2006

National African American History Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As we celebrate National African American History Month, we recognize 
the many contributions of African Americans to our country and reinforce 
our commitment to be a Nation of opportunity and hope for every citizen.
Throughout our history, African Americans have courageously worn our 
Nation's uniform while defending peace and liberty around the globe. 
Patriots like Thurgood Marshall and Rosa Parks broke down racial 
barriers and inspired our Nation to make good on the promise of equal 
justice under law. Educators like Mary McLeod Bethune and Dr. Frederick 
Patterson transformed the academic world, with the goal of ensuring that 
every child has access to a good education. Athletes such as Jesse Owens 
and Wilma Rudolph and entertainers such as Ossie Davis and Ray Charles 
have brought pride and joy to generations of Americans. Today, the 
accomplishments of African Americans in every aspect of our society 
continue to encourage people to reach as far as their vision and dreams 
may take them.
African-American organizations have played a vital role in achieving 
justice and equal rights, and they have helped make communities across 
our country stronger and better. This year's theme of African American 
History Month, ``Celebrating Community: A Tribute to Black Fraternal, 
Social, and Civic Institutions,'' recognizes the African-American groups 
that have worked to confront injustices and expand opportunities. These 
organizations believe in the potential and worth of every person, and 
they have worked to help all Americans receive a quality education, to 
feed the hungry and house the homeless, to encourage youth to make 
healthy choices, and to reach out to others in need. By answering the 
call to love a neighbor as we would like to be loved ourselves, these 
groups have set a positive example, and we continue to be inspired by 
their compassion and service to others.
Working together, Federal, State, and local government, community 
organizations, and individual citizens will continue to foster hope and 
build a better tomorrow for all our children and grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2006 as National 
African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities that honor the significant 
contributions African Americans have made to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7977 of January 30, 2006

Fourth Anniversary of the USA Freedom Corps, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans enjoy great liberty and prosperity, and with these blessings 
comes an obligation to reach out to those in need. Over the past 4 
years, USA Freedom Corps has worked to rally America's armies of 
compassion and bring together individuals and organizations committed to 
volunteer service. More than 65 million people volunteered in 2005, an 
increase of 6.5 million since 2002. As we celebrate the fourth 
anniversary of USA Freedom Corps, we recognize the many Americans who 
have stepped forward to help others, and we underscore our commitment to 
serving our Nation and people around the world.
USA Freedom Corps was created to build on the countless acts of service, 
sacrifice, and generosity that followed the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001. In the wake of the devastating tsunami of 2004 and 
hurricanes of 2005, Americans have continued to demonstrate that the 
true strength of our Nation lies in the hearts and souls of our 
citizens. By reaching out to aid the victims of these tragedies, people 
across our country helped rebuild shattered lives and communities. Their 
acts of service again demonstrated that by loving our neighbors as 
ourselves, we can offer hope and healing to those who suffer.
USA Freedom Corps is dedicated to expanding volunteer service and 
extending the goodwill of the American people. To help support our 
communities, respond to crises at home, and spread compassion around the 
globe, USA Freedom Corps works to strengthen public service programs 
such as the Peace Corps, Senior Corps, AmeriCorps, and Citizen Corps. 
USA Freedom Corps encourages and promotes the good work of non-profit, 
faith-based, and community organizations. Through the President's 
Greeter Program and the President's Volunteer Service Award, USA Freedom 
Corps and the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation 
recognize Americans who have made serving their neighbors a central part 
of their lives. USA Freedom Corps has also created a comprehensive 
network of volunteer opportunities to help more Americans find ways to 
get involved in serving their communities.
Through USA Freedom Corps, my Administration will continue to build a 
culture of service, citizenship, and responsibility in our country. To 
learn more about opportunities for volunteering, citizens can visit the 
USA Freedom Corps website at www.volunteer.gov. By working together for 
a cause greater than self, we can strengthen our Nation, one person, one 
neighborhood, and one community at a time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the Fourth Anniversary of 
USA Freedom Corps. I call upon the citizens of this great country to 
find ways to volunteer and help their fellow Americans. I commend the 
efforts of USA Freedom Corps and all those who have already answered the 
call

[[Page 6]]

to serve, and I encourage all Americans to donate their time, energy, 
and talents to the work ahead.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7978 of February 1, 2006

American Heart Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 70 million Americans live with some form of heart disease, and 
this disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. 
During American Heart Month, we reinforce our commitment to fighting 
heart disease by promoting awareness about its risks, its causes, and 
the ways to reduce the chance of developing this deadly illness.
Many of the factors that lead to heart disease, such as high blood 
pressure, high blood cholesterol, and obesity, can be controlled with 
commonsense steps and healthy lifestyles. Through the HealthierUS 
Initiative, my Administration encourages Americans to work toward four 
simple goals that can lead to a healthy heart: exercise daily; develop 
good eating habits; avoid tobacco, drugs, and excessive alcohol; and 
take advantage of preventive screenings to detect problems early.
First Lady Laura Bush helps lead ``The Heart Truth'' campaign through 
her Women's Health and Wellness Initiative. The campaign was launched by 
business, non-profit, and government organizations, including the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, to educate women about the 
risks of heart disease and to encourage them to make their 
cardiovascular health a priority. Along with the American Heart 
Association's ``Go Red for Women'' campaign, these initiatives use the 
red dress as a symbol to remind women to make healthy choices and talk 
with their doctors about heart disease.
As a result of the Medicare Modernization Act, our seniors have more 
choices to prevent, diagnose, and treat potential problems before they 
become worse. Medicare now covers preventive screenings, a ``Welcome to 
Medicare'' physical for new beneficiaries, and innovative programs to 
help seniors fight chronic threats. I urge all Medicare beneficiaries to 
take advantage of these measures as part of a healthy lifestyle.
All Americans can improve their heart health and live longer, better 
lives by taking an active role in their health care decisions and 
consulting their physician for the latest information. As we observe 
American Heart Month, we recognize those battling heart disease; we 
express gratitude to the family members and friends who are a source of 
love and encouragement; and we commend the medical professionals and 
researchers who provide assistance and work to find cures and improve 
treatments.

[[Page 7]]

In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963, as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has 
requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating 
February as ``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2006 as American Heart Month, and I 
invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 
3, 2006. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and 
reaffirming our commitment to combating heart disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7979 of February 3, 2006

National Consumer Protection Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Consumer Protection Week, we highlight the importance of 
consumer education in the ongoing fight against fraud and encourage 
consumers to make wise decisions.
Each year, nearly 25 million adults are victims of consumer fraud. These 
crimes damage lives and shake consumer confidence. The Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) and other organizations recommend several steps that 
Americans can take to help protect themselves against fraud. First, 
consumers should be cautious about giving out personal information such 
as Social Security and account numbers. Second, they should be aware of 
the credentials of an organization before making a transaction, 
especially through the mail, over the phone, or on the Internet. Third, 
before finalizing a purchase or agreement, the FTC suggests considering 
offers with care, avoiding immediate decisions, and requesting to have 
information in writing. In addition, when using the Internet, the FTC 
recommends that consumers exercise caution in responding to 
solicitations and that consumers use and regularly update their anti-
virus software and firewall.
My Administration is committed to vigorous enforcement of the consumer 
protection statutes, and the Department of Justice's Office of Consumer 
Litigation and other Federal agencies are working diligently to that 
end. The FTC is working to fight unsolicited e-mail under the 
Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act 
and is establishing new rules under the Fair and Accurate Credit 
Transactions Act to further protect against identity theft. We are 
protecting American consumers through the National Do-Not-Call Registry. 
Millions of Americans have registered already, and individuals may call 
1-888-382-1222 or visit the Do-

[[Page 8]]

Not-Call website at www.donotcall.gov to have their number added to the 
list. Citizens can learn more about ways to fight fraud from the 
National Consumer Protection Week website at www.consumer.gov/ncpw. By 
actively guarding against fraud, consumers can protect themselves and 
enhance the strength and integrity of our Nation's economy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 5 through 
February 11, 2006, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon 
Government officials, industry leaders, and consumer advocates to 
provide citizens with information about how they can be responsible 
consumers, and I encourage all citizens to take an active role in 
protecting their personal information.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Death of Coretta Scott King

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a mark of respect for the memory of Coretta Scott King, I hereby 
order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the 
United States of America, that on February 7, 2006, the day of her 
interment, the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at 
the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all 
military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the 
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United 
States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on such day. I 
also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same 
period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and 
other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval 
vessels and stations.

Proclamation 7981 of February 22, 2006

To Modify the Duty Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2462), authorizes the President to designate countries as 
beneficiary developing countries, and to designate any beneficiary 
developing country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country, 
for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.
2. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and taking into account the 
factors set forth in section 502(c) (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have 
determined that the suspension pursuant to Proclamation 6123 of April 
26, 1990, of preferential treatment for Liberia as a beneficiary 
developing country under the GSP should be ended.
3. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and having considered the 
factors set forth in sections 501 (19 U.S.C. 2461) and 502(c), I have 
also determined that Liberia should be desig nated as a least-developed 
beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
4. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes 
the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the 
United States the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other 
acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including title V and section 
604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461-67, 2483), do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to reflect in the HTS the restoration of preferential 
treatment for Liberia as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP, 
general note 4(a) is modified by adding in alphabetical order 
``Liberia'' to the list entitled ``Independent Countries.''
    (2) In order to reflect in the HTS the designation of Liberia as a 
least-developed beneficiary developing country under the GSP, general 
note 4(b)(i) is modified by adding in alphabetical order ``Liberia.''
    (3) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraph 1 of this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 15 days after the 
date of this proclamation.
    (4) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraph 2 of this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 60 days after the 
date of this proclamation.
    (5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

Proclamation 7982 of February 24, 2006

American Red Cross Month

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our Nation's history, Americans have worked together to care 
for those in need. The work of the American Red Cross exemplifies this 
tradition and reflects the good heart of our country. This year during 
American Red Cross Month, we recognize this organization for its 125 
years of faithful service to our Nation and for its continued mission to 
help those in need at home and abroad.
Since Clara Barton founded the organization in 1881, the American Red 
Cross has offered aid and disaster relief to millions of individuals. 
From conducting blood drives and arranging family communications and 
other forms of support for our troops to providing relief for victims of 
natural disasters, the American Red Cross carries out emergency response 
around the globe. Local chapters help American communities respond to 
regional catastrophes and promote emergency preparedness with American 
Red Cross First Aid and CPR courses. Members of these chapters serve 
their communities by visiting homebound seniors, mentoring youth, 
distributing hot lunches, volunteering at homeless shelters, and 
offering transitional housing. They also educate young people on 
violence and substance abuse prevention and help in hospitals and 
nursing homes.
In 2005, a devastating hurricane season left millions displaced and 
homeless. The American Red Cross network of more than 800 chapters and 
thousands of volunteers provided food, shelter, counseling, and care to 
more than a million Gulf Coast families. Working in coordination with 
the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the American Red 
Cross has also assisted with relief efforts for victims of hurricanes 
and landslides in Latin America and the recent earthquake in South Asia.
By donating their time and energy to selflessly serve others, American 
Red Cross volunteers demonstrate the compassion and generosity for which 
Americans are known. Their service paves the way to a brighter future 
for our citizens and people around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim March 2006 as American Red Cross Month. I 
commend the good work of the American Red Cross, and I encourage all 
Americans to continue to help the recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast 
region and around the world through volunteering their time, energy, and 
talents for others.

Proclamation 7983 of February 24, 2006

Irish-American Heritage Month

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The histories of Ireland and the United States are deeply intertwined. 
For generations, the sons and daughters of Ireland have come to America 
with a spirit of determination and optimism that has strengthened our 
Nation's character and enriched our history. During Irish-American 
Heritage Month, we celebrate Irish Americans and the significant 
contributions they have made to our Nation.
During the Great Potato Famine of the 19th century, approximately 1 
million Irish came to America. And over the last 150 years, millions 
more have come from Ireland to the United States. In this country, Irish 
Americans have ably served in their communities, in the government, and 
in the Armed Forces. They have achieved great success in all walks of 
life. Actress Grace Kelly entertained us and influenced our culture; 
industrialist Henry Ford transformed factory production and 
transportation; and President Ronald Reagan dedicated himself to the 
spread of peace, liberty, and democracy, helping to change our country 
and the world.
This month, we recognize the proud history and many accomplishments of 
Irish Americans. Our Nation is grateful for the role they have played in 
defending and renewing the ideals that we cherish. Their hard work, firm 
values, and strong faith have made our Nation a better place.
NOW, THEREFORE I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2006 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by celebrating the contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7984 of February 27, 2006

Establishment of the African American Burial Ground National Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In Lower Manhattan, at the corners of Duane and Elk Streets, lies an 
undeveloped parcel of approximately 15,000 square feet that constitutes 
a remaining portion of New York City's early African Burial Ground. The 
site is part of an approximately 7-acre National Historic Landmark 
established on April 19, 1993. From the 1690s to the 1790s, the African 
Burial Ground served as the final resting place of enslaved and free 
Africans in New York City, New York. It contains the remains of those 
interred, as well as the archeological resources and artifacts 
associated with their burials. Prior to the date of this proclamation, 
the site was administered by the General Services Administration (GSA), 
and it will be the location of a memorial, to be constructed soon 
according to a design selected on April 29, 2005, through a competition 
conducted by the GSA with the participation of the National Park Service 
(NPS) and other interested parties.
Whereas the African Burial Ground National Monument will promote 
understanding of related resources, encourage continuing research, and 
present interpretive opportunities and programs for visitors to better 
understand and honor the culture and vital contributions of generations 
of Africans and Americans of African descent to our Nation;
Whereas section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act'') authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by 
the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
Whereas it would be in the public interest to preserve the portion of 
the African Burial Ground at the corner of Duane and Elk Streets in New 
York City, and certain lands as necessary for the care and management of 
the historic and scientific objects therein, as the African Burial 
Ground National Monument;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Act of June 
8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), do proclaim that there are hereby 
set apart and reserved as the African Burial Ground National Monument 
for the purpose of protecting the objects described above, all lands and 
interests in lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United 
States with the boundaries described on the accompanying land 
description, which is attached and forms a part of this proclamation. 
The Federal land and interests in land reserved consist of approximately 
15,000 square feet, which is the smallest area compatible with the 
proper care and management of the objects to be protected.

[[Page 13]]

All Federal lands and interests of lands within the boundaries of this 
monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, 
location, selection, sale, or leasing or other disposition under the 
public land laws, including, but not limited to, withdrawal from 
location, entry, and patent under mining laws, and from disposition 
under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.
The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), acting through the NPS, shall 
administer the national monument consistent with the purposes and 
provisions of this proclamation and applicable laws and regulations 
governing management of units of the national park system. For the 
purposes of preserving, interpreting, and enhancing public understanding 
and appreciation of the national monument and its meaning to society, 
the Secretary, acting through the NPS, shall develop an interagency 
agreement with the Administrator of General Services and, within 3 years 
of the date of this proclamation, prepare a management plan for the 
national monument. The management plan shall, among other provisions, 
set forth the desired relationship of the national monument to other 
related resources, programs, and organizations in New York City and 
other locations, provide for maximum public involvement in its 
development, and identify steps to be taken to provide interpretive 
opportunities for the entirety of the National Historic Landmark and 
related sites in New York City. Further, to the extent authorized by 
law, the Secretary, acting through the NPS, shall promulgate any 
additional regulations needed for the proper care and management of the 
objects identified above.
The establishment of this monument is subject to valid existing rights.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to revoke any existing 
withdrawal, reservation, or appropriation; however, the national 
monument shall be the dominant reservation.
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, 
injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to 
locate or settle upon any lands thereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7985 of February 27, 2006

Women's History Month

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For generations, women across our great land have helped make our 
country stronger and better. They have improved our communities and 
played a vital role in achieving justice and equal rights for all our 
citizens. During Women's History Month, we celebrate the many 
contributions women make to our society.
At the end of the 19th century, pioneers Jane Addams and Ellen Starr 
opened the doors of Hull House to serve impoverished and immigrant 
families in the Chicago community. Presidential Medal of Freedom winner 
Annie Dodge Wauneka worked to educate her native Navajo community about 
preventing and treating disease. In 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up 
her seat on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, helping to inspire a 
nationwide movement for equal justice under the law. Recently, our 
Nation said goodbye to another remarkable American woman and courageous 
civil rights leader, Coretta Scott King, who helped call America to its 
founding ideals.
Today, the United States of America remains a country that offers the 
greatest freedom on Earth and believes in the promise of all 
individuals. Women continue to strengthen our Nation and the world by 
excelling as leaders in all walks of life, including business, law, 
politics, family life, education, community service, science, medicine, 
and the arts. The brave women who wear the uniform of the United States 
Armed Forces are helping to lay the foundations of peace and freedom for 
generations to come. This month, I encourage all Americans to join me in 
celebrating the extraordinary achievements and contributions of American 
women.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2006 as Women's 
History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor the history, 
accomplishments, and contributions of all American women.

Proclamation 7986 of February 27, 2006

Save Your Vision Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Many Americans suffer from diseases and disorders of the eye that can 
affect their vision and quality of life. During Save Your Vision Week, 
we highlight how basic eye care and protection can help citizens 
maintain and enjoy healthy eyesight.
An important part of ensuring physical well-being includes making 
healthy choices and adopting habits that can prevent disease and injury. 
Many of the problems that lead to blindness each year can be avoided 
with simple steps to protect the eyes, such as wearing sunglasses and 
using protective eyewear while working in hazardous environments or 
participating in sports.
Because the first noticeable symptom of many eye diseases is often 
vision loss, early detection is vital. As a result of the Medicare 
Modernization Act, diabetes screenings and glaucoma tests for eligible 
beneficiaries are now covered by Medicare as a part of an initial 
physical exam for new Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare also covers 
glaucoma screenings for beneficiaries with diabetes who are at high risk 
or have a family history of the disease. I encourage America's seniors 
to act to preserve their vision by taking advantage of this health care 
benefit. And I urge all Americans to have regular eye examinations as 
part of their health care routines.
By raising awareness about the importance of preventing eye problems and 
the measures citizens can take to protect their vision and by providing 
greater access for the detection and treatment of eye diseases, we can 
continue to work toward a healthier Nation where more Americans enjoy 
the gift of healthy vision.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended 
(77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and requested the 
President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as ``Save 
Your Vision Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 5 through March 11, 2006, as Save Your 
Vision Week. I encourage all Americans to make eye care and eye safety 
an important part of their lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7987 of February 28, 2006

To Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free 
Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican 
Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the 
``Agreement'') with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the ``Agreement countries''). The 
Agreement was approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the 
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``Act'')(Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 462)(19 
U.S.C. 4001 note).
2. Section 105(a) of the Act authorizes the President to establish or 
designate within the Department of Commerce an office that shall be 
responsible for providing administrative assistance to panels 
established under Chapter Twenty of the Agreement.
3. Section 201 of the Act authorizes the President to proclaim such 
modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-
free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President 
determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Articles 
3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.21, 3.26, 3.27, and 3.28, and Annexes 3.3 (including 
the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to

of Preferences (GSP) on the date the Agreement enters into force with 
respect to that country.
5. Consistent with section 201(a)(3) of the Act, each Agreement country 
is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary 
countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA)(19 
U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) on the date the Agreement enters into force with 
respect to that country, subject to the exceptions set out in section

6. Consistent with section 213(b)(5)(D) of the CBERA, as amended by the 
United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA)(Public Law 
106-200), each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration 
of designated CBTPA beneficiary countries on the date the Agreement 
enters into force with respect to that country.
7. Section 203 of the Act provides certain rules for determining whether 
a good is an originating good for the purpose of implementing 
preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement. I have decided that 
it is necessary to include these rules of origin, together with 
particular rules applicable to certain other goods, in the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).
8. Section 203(o) of the Act authorizes the President to determine that 
a fabric, yarn, or fiber is not available in commercial quantities in a

Agreement has entered into force, and to add any such fabric, yarn, or 
fiber to the list in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement in a restricted or 
unrestricted quantity; to eliminate a restriction on the quantity of a 
fabric, yarn, or fiber within 6 months after adding the fabric, yarn, or 
fiber to the list in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement in a restricted 
quantity; and to restrict the quantity of, or remove from the list in 
Annex 3.25 of the Agreement, certain fabrics, yarns, or fibers.
9. Section 209 of the Act authorizes the President to take certain 
enforcement actions relating to trade with the Agreement countries in 
textile or apparel goods.
10. Sections 321-328 of the Act authorize the President to take certain 
actions in response to a request by an interested party for relief from 
serious damage or actual threat thereof to a domestic industry producing 
certain textile or apparel articles.
11. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established the 
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) to

12. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting 
import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 
105(a), 201, 203, 209, and 321-328 of the Act, section 301 of title 3,

of the United States to Implement the Dominican Republic-Central 
America-United States Free Trade Agreement With Respect to El Salvador'' 
(``Publication 3829''), which is incorporated by reference into this 
proclamation.
    (2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty elimination

Proclamation 7988 of March 10, 2006

National Poison Prevention Week

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Poison Prevention Week helps raise awareness about the dangers 
of poison exposure. Our Nation has made great progress in reducing the 
number of poison-related deaths and injuries since the first National 
Poison Prevention Week in 1962, yet poisonings remain a threat to the 
health and safety of many Americans.
Approximately 1 million of our Nation's children under the age of 5 are 
exposed to poisonous substances each year. Most of these instances are 
preventable and result from the ingestion of household products. The 
Consumer Product Safety Commission requires child-resistant packaging 
for many medicines and household chemicals, and it is important for 
parents and adults to remember to act responsibly by storing these 
substances out of the reach of children.
The most common cause of death due to accidental poisoning results from 
exposure to carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless gas that is produced 
by products such as grills, gas stoves, water heaters, and automobiles. 
Every year, more than 500 Americans die from carbon monoxide poisoning, 
usually during winter months. Knowledge is the key to preventing this 
kind of poisoning. Placing a carbon monoxide alarm on each level of a 
home, and especially near bedrooms, is a good way to monitor air quality 
and remain alert to potentially high levels of carbon monoxide.
Information about poison exposure and how homes can be made safer is 
available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, 
www.cdc.gov/health/poisoning.html, and the Poison Prevention Week 
Council website, www.poisonprevention.org. In case of emergency, 
families can contact their nearest Poison Control Center, 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a

[[Page 22]]

week, by calling 1-800-222-1222. By working together and taking the 
appropriate precautions, we can help to prevent deaths and injuries 
caused by accidental poisonings.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the 
third week of March each year as ``National Poison Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 19 through March 25, 2006, as National 
Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week 
by participating in appropriate activities and by learning how to 
prevent poisonings, especially among children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of March, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 7989 of March 17, 2006

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Greek Independence Day, we celebrate the proud heritage of Greek 
Americans, recognize the longstanding friendship between the United 
States and Greece, and reaffirm our shared desire to spread freedom to 
people around the world.
Greece is the birthplace of democratic principles, and the story of 
modern Greek independence demonstrates the power of liberty. On March 
25, 1821, Greek revolutionaries declared their independence from the 
Ottoman Empire after centuries of imperial rule. This bold action began 
an 11-year war to secure their freedom and gain recognition as a 
sovereign country. Americans at the time identified with the Greek 
struggle and provided support to aid the effort. Leaders such as John 
Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison encouraged the Greek cause 
and supported the desire for a representative government that would 
ensure liberty and justice for all its citizens, and they offered our 
Constitution as a model for consideration.
A strong cooperation and friendship has developed between Greece and 
America, and our Nation has benefited from the contributions of Greek 
immigrants. The hard work of Greek Americans has made our country 
stronger and influenced our literature, arts, businesses, politics, 
education, and entertainment. The faith, traditions, and patriotism of 
Greek Americans have enriched our society.

[[Page 23]]

The United States and Greece are bound together by common values and a 
deep desire to protect and extend freedom and peace. On this special 
occasion, we celebrate our friendship and our commitment to advancing 
democracy, prosperity, and security.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2006, as Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 7990 of March 23, 2006

Small Business Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The entrepreneurial spirit of America is robust and strong, and small 
businesses are thriving throughout our great Nation. The opportunity to 
own a business is an important part of the American dream. During Small 
Business Week, we celebrate small business owners and employees who are 
willing to take risks and work hard in pursuit of a better life for 
themselves and their families.
Our economy has created almost 5 million jobs since August 2003. Small 
businesses create most new jobs in our country, and small businesses 
have been a driving force behind America's tremendous economic growth 
and job creation. By adopting sound economic policies that help small 
businesses continue to grow and expand, we will keep our economy moving 
forward and create more jobs for American workers.
My Administration remains committed to fostering an environment where 
innovation succeeds and small businesses can flourish. We are working 
with the Congress to make the tax relief permanent and to pass 
Association Health Plans to allow small businesses to join together and 
buy insurance at the same discounts big businesses receive. We are 
encouraging small business owners and employees to consider health 
savings accounts, which help small businesses provide health insurance 
for their workers and give consumers greater flexibility in how they 
spend their dollars. We also are continuing to work to open new markets 
for American products and services abroad. Putting a stop to the 
frivolous lawsuits that drive up the cost of doing business will further 
help small businesses enhance the quality of life for their employees 
and their communities.

[[Page 24]]

During Small Business Week, and throughout the year, we applaud the men 
and women who own and operate small businesses and spur economic growth. 
Through their entrepreneurial spirit and commitment to excellence, they 
help ensure that America remains a place where dreams are realized.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9 through April 15, 
2006, as Small Business Week. I call upon the people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs that celebrate the achievements of small business owners and 
their employees and encourage the development of new small businesses.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 7992 of March 29, 2006

Cancer Control Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Cancer Control Month, we continue the fight against 
cancer and work to reduce the risk of this deadly disease among our 
citizens.
Cancer survival rates are increasing, with approximately 10 million 
survivors in the United States. New understanding of diseases, better 
diagnostic tools, and innovative treatments help provide hope and 
healing to those who have been diagnosed with cancer. Across our 
country, cancer patients are living longer and fuller lives.
Despite these advances, cancer is still the second leading cause of 
death in our country, and some cancers, such as breast, prostate, lung, 
leukemia, and melanoma, continue to be too prevalent. By increasing 
public awareness and encouraging people to take appropriate steps to 
protect themselves, we can help prevent certain types of cancer. 
Individuals can reduce the risk of developing the disease by avoiding 
tobacco and excessive alcohol and by making healthy lifestyle choices. 
These include eating well, exercising regularly, and avoiding 
significant weight gain. I also encourage all Americans to get regular 
preventive screenings and speak with a health care provider about 
additional ways to reduce the risk of developing cancer.
My Administration is dedicated to furthering our progress in the fight 
against cancer. We lead the world in cutting-edge medical research, and 
I have requested $5.9 billion in my fiscal year 2007 Budget for cancer-
related activities within the Department of Health and Human Services. 
America will continue to aggressively fight cancer, encourage innovative 
research, and spread hope to those affected.
As we observe Cancer Control Month, I commend the strength and courage 
of cancer survivors, whose perseverance is an inspiration to all 
Americans. Our Nation is grateful for the generosity and skill of our 
medical professionals. These healers, along with the loving family 
members and friends of cancer patients, reflect the compassionate spirit 
of our people and help build a healthier future for our citizens. Cancer 
can be prevented, treated, and defeated, and we will continue to strive 
to reach the day when the battle to beat cancer has been won.
In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution (52 
Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103) as amended, requesting the President to issue 
an annual proclamation declaring April as ``Cancer Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 2006 as Cancer Control Month. I 
encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
will increase awareness of how to prevent and control cancer.

Proclamation 7993 of March 29, 2006

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our society has a responsibility to protect our children and help them 
thrive. During National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we underscore our 
strong commitment to preventing child abuse and neglect and to ensuring 
that all children have the opportunity to grow up in safe and nurturing 
environments.
Parents hold the primary responsibility for a child's health and well-
being and provide a foundation of love and support for their children. 
Parents are not alone as they work to keep their children safe. Helping 
children requires a commitment from other family members, as well as 
individuals and organizations in every community. Educators, concerned 
citizens, faith-based and community organizations, and public officials 
all have vital roles in protecting our children and supporting families. 
When children are surrounded by positive relationships and experiences, 
they are more likely to grow into confident and caring adults.
My Administration remains dedicated to protecting our youth from child 
abuse and neglect. The Federal Interagency Workgroup on Child Abuse and 
Neglect, led by the Department of Health and Human Services, provides a 
forum for Federal agencies to share information and make policy and 
program recommendations regarding the prevention, intervention, and 
treatment of child abuse and neglect. Through the National Child Abuse 
Prevention Initiative, my Administration is partnering with 
organizations across our country to promote the well-being of children 
and families and to assist efforts to eradicate abuse.
The Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children 
and Families hosts the National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect 
Information website at www.nccanch.acf.hhs.gov, which offers more 
information on how to prevent, recognize, and report signs of child 
abuse. By working together to provide America's young people the love, 
guidance, and protection they need, we can help protect our youth from 
abuse and give them the opportunity to achieve their dreams.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2006 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I encourage all citizens to protect our 
children and help build strong communities where individuals, families, 
and children are valued and supported.

Proclamation 7994 of March 29, 2006

National Donate Life Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Donate Life Month is an opportunity to celebrate the tremendous 
generosity of those who have saved lives by becoming organ, tissue, 
marrow, and blood donors and to encourage more Americans to follow their 
fine example.
Last year, more than 28,000 organ transplants took place in the United 
States--more than at any other time in history. Despite this progress, 
more than 90,000 of our fellow citizens remain on a waiting list for a 
donation, and many lives are lost each year while waiting for organ 
transplants. Through programs like the Workplace Partnership for Life, 
sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services, my 
Administration remains committed to supporting organ, marrow, tissue, 
and blood donations. As public and private organizations work together, 
we will educate more Americans about the importance of giving life.
During National Donate Life Month, I urge more Americans to make the 
decision to donate the gift of life. Individuals can learn more about 
becoming an organ and tissue donor at www.organdonor.gov. By saying yes 
to organ and tissue donation on their driver's licenses, adding their 
name to donor registries, or talking about their decision with family 
and friends, citizens help save lives and contribute to a more 
compassionate and hopeful society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2006 as National 
Donate Life Month. I call upon health care professionals, volunteers, 
educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and 
private organizations to help raise awareness about the urgent need for 
organ and tissue donors throughout our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

To Extend Nondiscriminatory Trade Treatment (Normal Trade Relations 
Treatment) to the Products of Ukraine, and For Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Ukraine has demonstrated a strong desire to build a friendly and 
cooperative relationship with the United States and has been found to be

seq.).
2. Pursuant to section 2(a) of Public Law 109-205, 120 Stat. 313 (19 
U.S.C. 2434), and having due regard for the findings of the Congress in 
section 1(a) of said law, I hereby determine that chapter 1 of title IV

America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 2(a) of Public Law 109-205, section 2103(a) of the Trade Act of 
2002, and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:
    (1) Nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations treatment) 
shall be extended to the products of Ukraine, which shall no longer be 
subject to chapter 1 of title IV of the 1974 Act.
    (2) The extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of 
Ukraine shall be effective as of the date of signature of this 
proclamation.
    (3) In order to implement the agreement on multi-chip integrated 
circuits, the HTS is modified to provide for application of zero duties 
to goods entered under tariff item 8543.89.96.
    (4) The modification to the HTS made pursuant to paragraph 3 of this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after April 1, 2006.
    (5) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

Proclamation 7997 of April 5, 2006

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A quality education is the cornerstone of a hopeful tomorrow for all our 
children. Education and Sharing Day highlights our strong support for 
our young people as they pursue lives of learning, prepare to become 
responsible leaders, and work to reach their full potential.
On Education and Sharing Day, we remember the efforts of Rabbi Menachem 
Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who promoted the importance of 
education and ethical teachings to every student's future. He sought to 
improve lives and communities through a vast network of education and 
outreach centers and social service programs around the world. We 
continue to be inspired by the Rebbe's good works and all those who 
dedicate their time, talents, and energy to helping our next generation 
grow into caring, responsible adults. Through devotion to faith, family, 
education, and community, we can continue building a better and more 
compassionate society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2006, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon government officials, 
educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to reach 
out to young people and work to create a better, brighter, and more 
hopeful future for all.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 7998 of April 5, 2006

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In every generation, America's Armed Forces have answered the call to 
duty with dedication and valor. On National Former Prisoner of War 
Recognition Day, we pay tribute to the brave patriots of the United 
States military who endured captivity because of war. These heroes 
sacrificed their personal liberty to secure a future of freedom for all 
Americans.
While held as prisoners of war, American POWs have reflected the best of 
our country, acting with resourcefulness, bravery, and strength. Former 
POWs, such as Corporal Tibor ``Ted'' Rubin, USA, continue to inspire new 
generations to acts of courage and compassion. Liberated by U.S. forces

[[Page 36]]

from a Nazi concentration camp, Rubin enlisted in the Army after 
immigrating to the United States. He was captured and held as a POW 
during the Korean War even before he became an American citizen. His 
incredible bravery and service to his fellow POWs saved many lives and 
has left a legacy of hope and honor, and for his heroism, I had the 
great privilege to present him our Nation's highest military award, the 
Medal of Honor.
The sacrifices of those taken as prisoners of war have helped bring 
security to American citizens and freedom to the world. With 
determination and courage, America's former POWs, their fallen and 
missing comrades, and their families have demonstrated the true spirit 
of our Nation, and they will never be forgotten.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2006, as National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon the people of the 
United States to join me in remembering and honoring the sacrifices of 
all American prisoners of war. I call upon Federal, State, and local 
government officials and private organizations to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 7999 of April 7, 2006

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Pan American Day and Pan American Week, we honor the commitment 
to liberty and common values we share with our Pan American neighbors.
The love of freedom has deep roots in the Pan American community. Not 
long after the United States won independence from Britain, patriots 
throughout the Americas were inspired to take their own stand. Today, 
there are more than 30 democratic countries in the region, and through 
the Organization of American States, leaders in the Western Hemisphere 
have an opportunity to discuss shared goals, promote prosperity, and 
strengthen democratic governance and institutions.
One of the surest ways to make opportunity real for all our citizens is 
through free and fair trade. In August 2005, I signed legislation to 
implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free 
Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). Our investment and trade through the CAFTA-
DR will help build a better life for our citizens, and by reducing trade 
barriers, we can make our region more competitive in the global economy. 
Strong economic ties with democracies in our hemisphere foster stability 
and security and help lay the foundation for peace for generations to 
come.

[[Page 37]]

The people of the Western Hemisphere are united by history, geography, 
and shared ideals. We will continue our important work to build a region 
that lives in liberty and grows in prosperity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2006, as Pan 
American Day and April 9 through April 15, 2006, as Pan American Week. I 
urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the 
United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8000 of April 7, 2006

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On National D.A.R.E. Day, we honor the dedicated police officers and all 
those involved in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program 
and underscore our commitment to helping young people say no to drugs 
and violence. By promoting positive youth development, D.A.R.E. programs 
across our country are helping our children make the right choices and 
build lives of purpose.
Since 1983, D.A.R.E. has taught young people how to recognize and resist 
the pressure to be involved in drugs, gangs, and violent activities. The 
D.A.R.E. program brings police officers into the classroom to answer 
tough questions about drugs and crime, teaches students how to avoid 
temptation, and encourages communication between young people and law 
enforcement. This program strengthens our communities and provides our 
children with a strong foundation for success.
My Administration remains committed to helping our young people overcome 
the dangers of violence and the use of illegal substances. The Helping 
America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, encourages 
local partnerships that empower families, schools, and communities to 
help young people reach their full potential. We are also strengthening 
youth drug prevention efforts on the State and local levels with the 
Strategic Prevention Framework and the Drug Free Communities program. 
These initiatives tailor prevention strategies to local needs and give 
community organizations the power to identify challenges and take 
actions to overcome them.
In 2005, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign and the Partnership 
for a Drug-Free America launched Above the Influence, an advertising

[[Page 38]]

and online campaign to encourage teens to reject drug use and other 
negative pressures. My Administration has also hosted a series of 
summits to educate community leaders and school officials on successful 
student drug testing.
The struggle against alcohol abuse, drugs, and violence is a national, 
state, and local effort. Parents, teachers, volunteers, D.A.R.E. 
officers, and all those who help our young people grow into responsible, 
successful adults are strengthening our country and contributing to a 
future of hope for everyone.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 11, 2006, as 
National D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon young people and all Americans to 
fight drug use and violence in our communities. I also urge our citizens 
to support the law enforcement officials, volunteers, teachers, health 
care professionals, and all those who work to help our children avoid 
drug use and violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8001 of April 13, 2006

Thomas Jefferson Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today, we celebrate the birthday of Thomas Jefferson. Few individuals 
have shaped the course of human events as much as this proud son of 
Virginia. His achievements are extraordinary: Governor of Virginia, 
author of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, Secretary of 
State, third President of the United States, and founder of the 
University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson was also a scholar, author, 
farmer, inventor, and architect. As President, Thomas Jefferson secured 
the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France, which doubled the 
size of the United States and extended opportunity and prosperity to 
many more Americans.
Thomas Jefferson was an eloquent and powerful champion of liberty. He 
captured the American creed when he wrote in a private letter: ``I have 
sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of 
tyranny over the mind of man.'' And in one of the most important public 
documents in history, Jefferson wrote these words: ``We hold these 
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among 
these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'' The Declaration 
of Independence has become a cornerstone for those who love freedom and 
justice.

[[Page 39]]

More than eight decades later, Abraham Lincoln returned to the words and 
meaning of the Declaration of Independence. Lincoln knew that in the 
distant future people would look upon it and ``take courage to renew the 
battle which their fathers began--so that truth, and justice, and mercy 
. . . might not be extinguished from the land.'' A century after 
Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., called the Declaration of Independence 
a ``promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.''
The Declaration of Independence has become a standard by which other 
nations and peoples measure their progress in the effort to advance 
human freedom. Even nations that are not yet free pay homage to freedom, 
and it is seen as a universal human good.
Our Nation is vastly different than it was during the days of our 
founding--yet our commitment to America's founding truths remains strong 
and steady. Our duty is to continue to fulfill the promise of Thomas 
Jefferson's words and vision of a better life for all people. Meeting 
that responsibility is the best way we can honor the memory of the man 
who was an architect of the freest Nation on Earth.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 13, 2006, 
as Thomas Jefferson Day. I encourage all Americans to join in 
celebrating Thomas Jefferson's achievements, reflecting on his words, 
and learning more about this extraordinary man's influence on American 
history and ideals.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8002 of April 18, 2006

National Park Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In America's national parks, the magnificent beauty of our country and 
important examples of our Nation's cultural heritage are preserved and 
made available to Americans and visitors from all over the world. Each 
year, as we observe National Park Week, we underscore our commitment to 
conserve our natural and historical treasures and encourage more 
Americans to enjoy, learn from, and protect these important parts of our 
heritage.
Our Nation has a long legacy of conservation. In 1872, Yellowstone 
National Park became our country's first national park, and more than 
four decades later, the National Park Service was created. Today, the 
national park system includes almost 400 sites, with parks in nearly 
every state. From Yosemite National Park in California to Acadia 
National Park in Maine, and from Independence Hall to the Martin Luther 
King, Jr., National

[[Page 40]]

Historic Site, America's national parks are home to some of our Nation's 
most beautiful landscapes and richest history.
This year's theme, ``Connecting our Children to America's National 
Parks,'' reflects the National Park Service's commitment to encouraging 
young people to enjoy outdoor recreation and better appreciate our 
Nation's beauty and history. The National Park Service Junior Rangers 
program develops interest in our national parks by teaching children and 
their families about the importance of the national park sites. Young 
people can visit our national parks online by going to the Junior 
Rangers website at www.nps.gov/WebRangers. As Honorary Chair of the 
National Park Foundation, First Lady Laura Bush helps raise awareness 
about preservation of the parks and encourages support for programs like 
the Junior Rangers. Through initiatives like this, the National Park 
Service is promoting good stewardship of the environment and 
appreciation of our Nation's heritage.
With the opportunity to live in America comes a responsibility to ensure 
that our national parks remain a source of pride, pleasure, and 
education for all our citizens. During National Park Week and throughout 
the year, we pay tribute to the employees and volunteers of the National 
Park Service. For the past 90 years, these dedicated men and women have 
worked to maintain and enhance our national parks and to ensure that 
they are preserved and enjoyed for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 22 through April 30, 
2006, as National Park Week. I call upon the people of the United States 
to join me in celebrating America's national parks and becoming active 
participants in park conservation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8003 of April 19, 2006

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For 50 years, the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports has 
helped individuals, schools, communities, businesses, and organizations 
promote healthy lifestyles. During this year's National Physical Fitness 
and Sports Month, we celebrate the Council's 50th anniversary and 
underscore our Nation's strong commitment to health, physical activity, 
and fitness.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower founded the President's Council on Youth 
Fitness in 1956 to encourage America's youth to make fitness a priority. 
He wrote that year, ``Our young people must be physically as well as 
mentally and spiritually prepared for American citizenship.'' The 
Council later became the President's Council on Physical Fitness and 
Sports, including

[[Page 41]]

people of all ages and abilities and promoting fitness through sports 
and games.
Today, the Council continues to play an important role in promoting 
fitness and healthy living in America. My HealthierUS Initiative 
provides simple steps to help citizens live longer and better lives, and 
millions of young people and adults have participated in the President's 
Challenge awards program. The Council's website, fitness.gov, has 
information about these programs and other ways Americans can improve 
their health through physical activity. By exercising regularly and 
maintaining healthy eating habits, individuals can feel better and 
reduce their risk of chronic health conditions like obesity, diabetes, 
heart disease, and cancer. An active lifestyle also creates 
opportunities for friends and family to spend time together and enjoy 
various forms of exercise, such as biking, hiking, and team sports. The 
medical benefits, increased self-confidence, and stress reduction that 
can come from athletic activity help contribute to a healthier, more 
productive Nation.
I urge children, teens, and all Americans to make time every day for 
exercise and to encourage family, friends, and neighbors to live 
healthier lives by participating in physical fitness activities. As 
President Kennedy said at the 1961 Youth Fitness Conference, ``We do not 
want in the United States a nation of spectators. We want a nation of 
participants in the vigorous life.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2006 as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to make daily exercise a priority. I encourage individuals, 
community organizations, and schools to celebrate with physical and 
athletic activities and to work toward the great national goal of an 
active, fit America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8004 of April 19, 2006

National Volunteer Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our country, volunteers make America stronger and better by 
reaching out to help their neighbors in need. During National Volunteer 
Week, we recognize the millions of individuals who dedicate their time, 
talents, and energy to making a difference in the lives of others and 
reaffirm our commitment to supporting these soldiers in the armies of 
compassion.
In the 1830s, a Frenchman named Alexis de Tocqueville visited our Nation 
and saw that the secret to America's success was our talent for bringing

[[Page 42]]

people together for the common good and our willingness to serve a cause 
greater than self. Today, the great strength of America is still found 
in the hearts and souls of our people. By making a commitment to 
service, integrity, and good citizenship, our Nation's volunteers show 
their gratitude for the blessings of freedom and help build a more 
hopeful future for our children and grandchildren.
Since we created USA Freedom Corps in 2002, my Administration has 
matched millions of willing volunteers with opportunities to serve in 
their communities. These kind-hearted individuals help people who hurt, 
mentor children who need love, feed those who are hungry, and shelter 
those who need homes. In the aftermath of the devastating hurricanes of 
2005, people throughout our great Nation opened their hearts to help the 
Gulf Coast recover and rebuild. We will continue to foster the efforts 
of the millions who care deeply about the future of our country and the 
plight of their fellow citizens. Americans can find more information 
about volunteer service opportunities in their own hometowns by visiting 
the USA Freedom Corps website at volunteer.gov.
Our Nation is a force for freedom and prosperity, and our greatness is 
measured by our character and how we treat one another. During National 
Volunteer Week, and throughout the year, we appreciate the millions of 
volunteers across America and strive to be a more compassionate and 
decent society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 23 through April 29, 
2006, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize 
and celebrate the important work that volunteers do every day throughout 
our country. I also encourage citizens to explore ways to help their 
neighbors in need and serve a cause greater than themselves.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Jewish American Heritage Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When the first Jewish settlers came to this land, they sought a place of 
promise where they could practice their faith in freedom and live in 
liberty. During Jewish American Heritage Month, we celebrate the rich 
history of the Jewish people in America and honor the great 
contributions they have made to our country.
As a nation of immigrants, the United States is better and stronger

citizens. Since arriving in 1654, Jewish Americans have achieved great 
success, strengthened our country, and helped shape our way of life. 
Through their deep commitment to faith, family, and community, Jewish 
Americans remind us of a basic belief that guided the founding of this 
Nation: that there is an Almighty who watches over the affairs of men 
and values every life. The Jewish people have enriched our culture and 
contributed to a more compassionate and hopeful America.
Jewish American Heritage Month is also an opportunity to remember and 
thank the many Jewish Americans who defend our ideals as members of the 
United States Armed Forces. These courageous men and women risk their 
lives to protect their fellow citizens and to advance the cause of 
freedom. By helping to bring the promise of liberty to millions around 
the world, they lay the foundation of peace for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2006 as Jewish 
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
with appropriate programs and activities that honor the significant 
contributions Jewish Americans have made to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8006 of April 20, 2006

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we underscore our commitment 
to safeguarding the rights of the victims of crime and their families, 
and we honor those who bring them hope and comfort.
Behind each crime victim there is a story of trauma, a story of 
suffering, and a story of lost security. This year's theme, ``Victims' 
Rights: Strength in Unity,'' emphasizes the importance of joining 
together to support these individuals and to promote victims' rights and 
services. With the help of victim service providers, faith-based and 
community groups, justice professionals, and volunteers, we can work to 
improve the lives of crime victims across our country.
Violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s, 
and we must continue our progress in the fight against crime and remain 
dedicated to protecting the rights of crime victims. The Office for 
Victims of Crime at the Department of Justice (DOJ) provides funding to 
States for victim assistance programs and supports training on victims' 
rights for criminal justice professionals. To increase access to 
comprehensive support and services for victims of domestic violence, the 
DOJ awarded more than $20 million to support the creation of 15 Family 
Justice Centers across the

[[Page 44]]

country. Several of these centers have opened and are making a 
difference in victims' lives. To further ensure basic rights for all 
victims, we must also ratify a Crime Victims' Rights Amendment to the 
Constitution.
To learn more about victims' rights and how to make a difference, visit 
crimevictims.gov. All Americans share a responsibility to help victims 
of crime, and our Nation will continue to work together to achieve 
justice for victims and build a more hopeful society for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 23 through April 29, 
2006, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I encourage all Americans 
to promote awareness of victims' rights and advance this important 
cause.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8007 of April 26, 2006

National Charter Schools Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Education is the gateway to a brighter future for our children and our 
Nation. During National Charter Schools Week, we celebrate charter 
schools' commitment to academic achievement, accountability, and 
innovation. We recognize the vital role charter schools play in 
fostering an America where children have the knowledge and skills they 
need to grow, succeed, and achieve their dreams.
As a publicly funded alternative to traditional public schools, charter 
schools have expanded our understanding of public education by embracing 
the spirit of discovery and providing innovative avenues for success. 
Almost 15 years after the founding of the first charter school, more 
than 3,600 charter schools in 40 states and the District of Columbia are 
teaching more than one million students. These institutions reflect our 
belief in the promise of America's youth and help fulfill our moral 
obligation to make sure that every child has a quality education.
This year marks the fourth anniversary of the signing of the No Child 
Left Behind Act, which is helping schools close the achievement gap 
among America's youth. Using the same principles that guide No Child 
Left Behind, we are achieving educational excellence through charter 
schools by providing greater flexibility with Federal dollars and 
curriculum control at the local level. We are also providing parents 
with more information about school performance and school options and 
insisting on results through assessment and accountability.
In the aftermath of the devastating hurricanes that struck our Nation's 
Gulf Coast last year, charter schools are playing a major role in 
welcoming back

[[Page 45]]

school children affected by the storms. Because of their unique 
flexibility, many Gulf Coast charter schools were able to reopen 
quickly, and many of the public schools that have reopened in New 
Orleans now operate as charter schools. By enabling these children to 
continue their education, charter schools are helping families and 
demonstrating a deep compassion for America's students.
We must give every child the best opportunity to learn and succeed in 
life. Charter schools help prepare our next generation of leaders and 
help ensure that America continues to succeed in the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 30 through May 6, 
2006, as National Charter Schools Week. I appreciate our Nation's 
charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on parents of 
charter school students to share their successes and help all Americans 
understand more about the important work of charter schools.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, we honor and celebrate the 
millions of Asian/Pacific Americans whose contributions have helped make 
America a strong, vibrant, and free society.
Asian/Pacific Americans represent many nations and ethnicities, each 
with its own culture, heritage, language, and experience. Across our 
country, this diverse group of people has excelled in all walks of life. 
Their talent and hard work have added to the success and prosperity of 
our Nation and helped make America a leader in the world. They have 
helped shape America's character and identity through their strong 
values, love of family, and commitment to community. America is 
especially grateful to the many Asian/Pacific Americans who have 
courageously answered the call to defend freedom as members of our Armed 
Forces. The sacrifices of these brave men and women help preserve the 
ideals of our country's founding and make the world a safer place.
To honor the achievements and contributions of Asian/Pacific Americans, 
the Congress, by Public Law 102-450 as amended, has designated the month 
of May each year as ``Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 2006 as Asian/Pacific American Heritage 
Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more about

[[Page 46]]

the history of Asian/Pacific Americans and their role in our national 
story and to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.

Proclamation 8009 of April 28, 2006

Older Americans Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Older Americans represent the finest qualities of our Nation. During 
Older Americans Month, we honor our older citizens, celebrate their many 
accomplishments, and learn from their experiences.
Across our country, older Americans are demonstrating personal strength 
and compassion and are redefining the experience of aging. They are 
leading active lives, serving in their communities, and reaching out to 
their fellow Americans. Through organizations like Senior Corps, they 
are mentoring children, helping victims of natural disasters, and caring 
for citizens with disabilities. Their good works are changing the lives 
of many individuals and contributing to the strength of America.
This year's theme, ``Choices for Independence,'' reflects the importance 
of our citizens making retirement, lifestyle, and health choices that 
enhance their quality of life as they grow older. My Administration is 
committed to strengthening senior programs and ensuring the health and 
retirement security of older Americans. The Medicare Prescription Drug, 
Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 provides for the biggest 
improvement in health care for our seniors in nearly 40 years. In 
addition, the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit, Medicare Part D, is 
helping seniors receive the prescription drugs they need at reduced 
costs.
Our Nation is blessed by our seniors. These individuals teach us lessons 
of the past, set an example for younger generations, and demonstrate the 
generosity and love for which Americans are known. This month, I 
encourage all our citizens to spend time with America's seniors.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2006 as Older 
Americans Month. I appreciate our senior citizens for their achievements 
and contributions to our Nation. I also commend the Federal, State, 
local, and tribal organizations, service and health care providers, 
caregivers, and volunteers who dedicate their time and talents to our 
seniors. I urge all citizens to honor their elders and reaffirm our 
country's commitment to their well-being this month and throughout the 
year.

Proclamation 8010 of April 28, 2006

Law Day, U.S.A.

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's legal system is central to protecting the constitutional 
principles on which our Nation was founded. As we observe Law Day, we 
celebrate our heritage of freedom, justice, and equality under the law.
This year's Law Day theme, ``Liberty Under Law: Separate Branches, 
Balanced Powers,'' honors the wisdom of the separation of powers that 
the Framers of our Constitution established for the Federal Government. 
Delegates to the Constitutional Convention recognized the risks that 
accompany the concentration of power and devised a system in which the 
Federal Government's authorities are divided among three independent 
branches. James Madison highlighted the importance of our Constitution's 
separation of powers when he wrote, ``the accumulation of all powers, 
legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands . . . may 
justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''
Throughout our Nation's history, we have been reminded repeatedly of the 
wisdom of the Framers' design. Our system of separation of powers has 
safeguarded our liberties and helped ensure that we remain a government 
of laws. Law Day is an occasion for us to celebrate our Constitution and 
to honor those in the judiciary and legal profession who work to uphold 
and serve its principles.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2006, as Law Day, U.S.A. I call upon all the people of 
the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. I also call upon Government officials to display the flag of 
the United States in support of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 8011 of April 28, 2006

Loyalty Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation is blessed and bound together by a creed of freedom and 
equality that is entrusted to all Americans. Preserving the ideals of 
our founding requires the service and sacrifice of every generation, and 
on Loyalty Day, we celebrate the gift of liberty and remember our own 
obligation to this great Nation.
The dedication and selflessness of America's soldiers and their families 
inspire us all. Some of our Nation's finest men and women have given 
their lives in freedom's cause. By their sacrifices they have given us a 
legacy of liberty and brought honor to the uniform, our flag, and our 
country. The American people are grateful to the brave men and women of 
our military for their service and we will always stand behind them. I 
encourage all Americans to learn more about opportunities to thank and 
support our troops, from sending a care package to writing a message, by 
visiting www.americasupportsyou.mil.
Loyalty Day is also a time for us to reflect on our responsibilities to 
our country as we work to show the world the meaning and promise of 
liberty. The right to vote is one of our most cherished rights and 
voting is one of our most fundamental duties. By making a commitment to 
be good citizens, flying the American flag, or taking the time to learn 
about our Nation's history, we show our gratitude for the blessings of 
freedom.
The greatest strength of America is in the heart and soul of its people, 
and every time a volunteer reaches out to a neighbor in need, our Nation 
grows stronger and more hopeful. Thousands of Americans are serving a 
higher calling by mentoring, coaching, serving in Senior Corps, and by 
participating in many other programs that enrich lives and help build a 
better tomorrow. The light of freedom shines brightly because of 
compassionate people who care about others. Their dedication to a cause 
greater than self gives all Americans confidence in the future of our 
Nation.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated May 1 of 
each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' I ask all Americans to join me in this day 
of celebration and in reaffirming our allegiance to our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2006, as Loyalty Day. I call upon all 
the people of the United States to join in support of this national 
observance, and to display the flag of the United States on Loyalty Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day

Proclamation 8012 of May 3, 2006

National Day of Prayer, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our Nation's history, our citizens have prayed and come 
together before God to offer Him gratitude, reflect on His will, seek 
His aid, and respond to His grace. On this National Day of Prayer, we 
thank God for His many blessings and His care of our country.
God has greatly blessed the American people, and in 1789, George 
Washington proclaimed: ``It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge 
the Providence of Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His 
benefits, and to humbly implore His protection and favor.'' Americans 
remain a prayerful and thankful people. We pray for the safety of our 
troops as they carry out dangerous missions with courage and compassion, 
and we remember the strength and sacrifice of their families. We pray 
for the good people of the Gulf Coast region as they work to rebuild 
their communities after the devastating hurricanes of 2005, and we thank 
God for the volunteers who have opened their hearts to help their 
neighbors in a time of need. We pray for the protection of innocent 
lives and for the expansion of peace and liberty throughout the world.
Through prayer, our faith is strengthened, our hearts are humbled, and 
our lives are transformed. May our Nation always have the humility to 
trust in the goodness of God's plans.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on our 
Nation to reaffirm the role of prayer in our culture and to respect the 
freedom of religion by recognizing each year a ``National Day of 
Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 4, 2006, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
ask the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, each according to his or 
her own faith, for the freedoms and blessings we have received and for 
God's continued guidance and protection. I urge all Americans to join in 
observing this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.

Mother's Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Mother's Day, we honor our mothers and pay tribute to their devoted 
work and selfless gift of love.

[[Page 50]]

America's mothers are women of determination and vision. They serve as 
caregivers and guides, helping to build the foundation for our 
children's success and nurturing them as they grow and explore the great 
promise of our Nation. Through their mothers' examples, children come to 
understand the virtue of kindness, the blessing of compassion, and the 
importance of principle. A mother's support encourages children to make 
right choices, set high goals, and become good citizens. A mother's love 
inspires children to achieve their full potential and strengthens the 
character of our country. The commitment and love of mothers reflect the 
best of America.
On this special day, we remember the many mothers whose sons and 
daughters serve in harm's way. The determination and courage of these 
women demonstrate the spirit of our Nation, and America will always be 
grateful for their unfailing devotion. We also recognize the dedication 
of the many mothers who serve in America's Armed Forces. These brave 
women protect the safety and security of our Nation and help ensure a 
peaceful future for our children.
To honor mothers, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 
1914, as amended (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May 
each year as ``Mother's Day'' and has requested the President to call 
for its appropriate observance. May God bless all mothers across our 
country on this special day, and throughout the year.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 14, 2006, as Mother's Day. I encourage 
all Americans to show their gratitude and love to mothers for making a 
difference in the lives of their children and communities. I call upon 
citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Every day, our Nation's dedicated law enforcement officers put 
themselves at risk to keep their fellow Americans safe. As we observe 
Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we pay tribute to the 
courageous men and women who have lost their lives protecting us, and we 
honor all those who wear the badge and keep the peace.
The law enforcement officers of today carry on the long and proud 
tradition of service built by their predecessors. With valor and 
distinction, these citizens stand watch over us all and work hard to 
fight crime, violence, and terrorism in communities across America. We 
are a country built on the rule of law, and our Nation is grateful to 
the men and women who enforce those laws and uphold the fairness and 
peace we treasure.

[[Page 51]]

Law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation for the work they do, 
and citizens fulfill an important civic responsibility by supporting 
their work to protect our communities. Through organizations like 
Citizen Corps, men and women are assisting their local police force, 
fire department, and neighborhood watch program. More information about 
Citizen Corps volunteer opportunities can be found at citizencorps.gov. 
I encourage all Americans to help fight crime in their communities by 
volunteering and participating in crime prevention organizations. By 
working together, we can achieve a better and more secure future for our 
children and grandchildren.
On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we honor the 
heroism of all our law enforcement officers, especially those who have 
given their lives so that others might live. They performed their jobs 
with extraordinary distinction, and a proud and grateful Nation will 
always remember their service and sacrifice. We ask God's blessings for 
the families and friends they left behind.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended, (76 Stat. 
676), the Congress has authorized and requested the President to 
designate May 15 of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the 
week in which it falls as ``Police Week,'' and by Public Law 103-322, as 
amended, (36 U.S.C. 136), has directed that the flag be flown at half 
staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2006, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 14 through May 20, 2006, as Police Week. I call on all Americans 
to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I 
also call on Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of 
government, to direct that the flag be flown at half staff on Peace 
Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the 
flag at half staff from their homes and businesses on that day.

Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons 
Responsible for Policies or Actions That Threaten the Transition to 
Democracy in Belarus

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In light of the importance to the United States of fostering democratic 
institutions in Belarus in order to help the Belarusian people achieve 
their aspirations for democracy and to help complete the transformation 
to a Europe whole, free, and at peace and given the suppression of human 
rights and

[[Page 52]]

democracy in Belarus, the fraud perpetrated during the recent Belarusian 
presidential campaign and election, the detention of peaceful protesters 
in Belarus, the persistent acts of corruption by Belarusian government 
officials in the performance of public functions, and the continued 
failure of Alyaksandr Lukashenka, Belarusian government officials, and 
others to support the rule of law, human rights commitments, and other 
principles of high priority to the United States, I have determined that 
it is in the interest of the United States to take all available

United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and 
nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons described in

United States.
I therefore hereby proclaim that:
Section 1. The entry into the United States, as immigrants or 
nonimmigrants, of the following persons is hereby suspended:
    (a) Members of the government of Alyaksandr Lukashenka and other

described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above.
Sec. 2. Section 1 of this proclamation shall not apply with respect to 
any person otherwise covered by section 1 where entry of such person 
would not be contrary to the interest of the United States.
Sec. 3. Persons covered by sections 1 and 2 of this proclamation shall 
be identified by the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee, in 
his or her sole discretion, pursuant to such procedures as the Secretary

United States Government obligations under applicable international 
agreements.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of State shall have responsibility for 
implementing this proclamation pursuant to such procedures as the

Sec. 6. This proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in 
effect until such time as the Secretary of State determines that it is 
no longer necessary and should be terminated, either in whole or in 
part. Any such termination by the Secretary of State shall be published 
in the Federal Register.

Proclamation 8016 of May 12, 2006

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On National Defense Transportation Day and during National 
Transportation Week, we thank all those who contribute to a sound 
transportation infrastructure that keeps our country moving, advances 
our economic growth, and strengthens our national defense.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower recognized the importance of having the 
world's most efficient and reliable transportation system. In a message 
to the Congress, he wrote of ``a vast system of inter-connected highways 
criss-crossing the Country and joining at our national borders with 
friendly neighbors to the north and south.'' Fifty years after he signed 
the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, the Interstate Highway System is a 
vital part of America's transportation infrastructure.
My Administration remains committed to providing the American people 
with the best possible transportation system. In August 2005, I signed 
the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity 
Act: A Legacy for Users, to upgrade our Nation's network of roads, 
bridges, and mass transit systems, introduce new safety standards, and 
fund needed road improvements that will ease traffic congestion in 
communities across our country. My Administration is also increasing 
research in advanced transportation technologies that will improve our 
environment, help us end our reliance on foreign sources of energy, and 
strengthen our economic and national security.
Modern transportation also enables our Armed Forces to quickly deploy 
troops, move crucial supplies and equipment, and assist with emergency 
situations. Whether on land, over water, or in the air, our citizens 
rely on the safety and efficiency of our transportation systems to 
arrive at work, deliver goods and services, and travel with family and 
friends. America is grateful to the dedicated transportation 
professionals and military service members for their tireless efforts to 
make America's transportation network the best in the world.

[[Page 54]]

To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry 
and who contribute to our Nation's well being and defense, the Congress, 
by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), 
has designated the third Friday in May each year as ``National Defense 
Transportation Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as 
amended (36 U.S.C. 133), declared that the week during which that Friday 
falls be designated as ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 19, 2006, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 14 through May 20, 2006, as National 
Transportation Week. I encourage all Americans to learn how our modern 
transportation system contributes to the security of our citizens and 
the prosperity of our country and to celebrate these observances with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

National Safe Boating Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

By providing an opportunity to experience our Nation's scenic waterways, 
recreational boating is one of our country's most popular activities. 
During National Safe Boating Week, we underscore the importance of 
taking safety precautions before going out on the water and encourage 
all Americans to make responsible decisions while boating.
This year marks the 35th anniversary of the enactment of the Federal 
Boat Safety Act, which has helped reduce the number of recreational 
boating deaths in our country. Yet despite significant progress, 
recreational boating accidents still occur and, tragically, the majority 
of them are preventable. Operator inattention and inexperience, careless 
and reckless navigation, and excessive speed are the leading 
contributing factors of all reported accidents. An estimated 70 percent 
of reported boating fatalities in 2004 occurred on boats where the 
operator had not received safety instruction, and of those victims who 
drowned, nearly 90 percent were not wearing life jackets.
America's boat owners and operators play a large role in helping ensure 
passenger safety. The United States Coast Guard initiative ``You're in 
Command'' serves to educate boaters about how to enjoy our Nation's 
waters safely and responsibly. For more information about being safe 
while on the water, boaters can visit uscgboating.org and 
safeboatingcampaign.com. By taking simple precautions such as wearing a 
life jacket, taking a boating safety course, getting a Vessel Safety 
Check, and never boating under the

[[Page 55]]

influence of alcohol or drugs, we can continue to save lives and reduce 
the number of accidents and injuries that occur each year.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe 
Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 20 through May 26, 2006, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage the Governors of the 50 States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, to join in observing this week. I 
also urge all Americans to learn more about safe boating practices and 
always engage in proper and responsible conduct while on the water.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence of the 
United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8019 of May 16, 2006

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, the men and women who have worn the uniform of 
the United States have placed the security of our Nation before their 
own safety. America will be forever grateful for their service and 
sacrifice. On Memorial Day, we honor those who have paid the ultimate 
price for our freedom.
Defending the ideals of our Nation has required the service and 
sacrifice of those from every generation. From Valley Forge, across 
Europe and Asia, and in Afghanistan and Iraq, courageous Americans have 
given their lives so that others could live in freedom. These Soldiers, 
Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen took an oath to defend 
America, and they upheld that oath with bravery and decency. They have 
liberated the oppressed, spread freedom and peace, and set a standard of 
courage and compassion for our Nation. All who enjoy the blessings of 
liberty live in their debt.
This debt of gratitude extends also to the families who stood by our 
servicemen and women in times of war and times of peace. Each of the 
fallen has left behind loved ones who carry a burden of grief, and all 
Americans are inspired by the strength of these families.
At this important time in the history of freedom, a new generation of 
Americans is defending our flag and our liberty. These men and women 
carry on the legacy of our Nation's fallen heroes and demonstrate that 
the United States Armed Forces remain the greatest force for freedom in 
human history.
Those who lost their lives in the defense of freedom helped protect our 
citizens and lay the foundation of peace for people everywhere. On 
Memorial Day, a grateful Nation pays tribute to their personal courage, 
love of country, and dedication to duty.
In respect for their devotion to America, the Congress, by a joint 
resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (64 Stat. 158), has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of 
the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for 
permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 
106-579, has also designated the minute beginning at 3:00 p.m. local 
time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe the National 
Moment of Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 29, 2006, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3 p.m., local time, on Memorial Day. I encourage the media 
to participate in these observances. I also request the Governors of the 
United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate 
officials of all units

[[Page 57]]

of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon 
on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels 
throughout the United States, and in all areas under its jurisdiction 
and control. I also request the people of the United States to display 
the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon 
period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8020 of May 19, 2006

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, private organizations, 
public officials, and government agencies will highlight the 
preparations necessary for the new hurricane season that begins on June 
1.
Last year, a record number of hurricanes caused unprecedented 
devastation across an entire region of our country. Our citizens along 
the Gulf Coast demonstrated their strength and resilience, and 
individuals across America revealed their compassion and resolve by 
opening their hearts, homes, and communities to those in need.
After these storms, Federal, State, and local governments have worked to 
enhance our Nation's ability to respond to large-scale natural 
disasters. The Federal Government has conducted an extensive review of 
preparedness and response efforts, and actions are being taken at all 
levels of government to improve communications and strengthen emergency 
response capabilities.
To help individuals, families, and businesses prepare for the future, 
the Department of Homeland Security provides checklists and information 
on natural disasters and other threats at ready.gov. By working 
together, government, private entities, and civic and charitable 
organizations can help increase preparedness for this year's hurricane 
season.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 
2006, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government 
agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in the 
coastal areas of our Nation to share information about hurricane 
preparedness and response to help save lives and protect communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8021 of May 19, 2006

National Maritime Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United States Merchant Marine plays an important role in ensuring 
our national security and strengthening our economy. As we celebrate 
National Maritime Day and the 70th anniversary of the Merchant Marine 
Act, we pay tribute to merchant mariners and their faithful service to 
our Nation.
Since 1775, merchant mariners have bravely served our country, and in 
1936, the Merchant Marine Act officially established their role in our 
military as a wartime naval auxiliary. During World War II, merchant 
mariners were critical to the delivery of troops and supplies overseas, 
and they helped keep vital ocean supply lines operating. President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt praised these brave merchant mariners for 
persevering ``despite the perils of the submarine, the dive bomber, and 
the surface raider.'' Today's merchant mariners follow those who 
courageously served before them as they continue to provide crucial 
support for our Nation's service men and women. America is grateful for 
their commitment to excellence and devotion to duty.
In addition to helping defend our country, merchant mariners facilitate 
commerce by importing and exporting goods throughout the world. They 
work with our Nation's transportation industry to share their valuable 
skills and experience in ship maintenance, navigation, and cargo 
transportation. This past year, the good work and compassion of merchant 
mariners also played an important role in hurricane relief efforts. 
Ships brought urgently needed supplies to the devastated areas, provided 
assistance for oil spill cleanup, generated electricity, and provided 
meals and lodging for recovery workers and evacuees.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 20, 1933, as amended, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day,'' and has 
authorized and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2006, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon all the people of the United States to mark this observance by 
honoring the service of merchant mariners and by displaying the flag of 
the United States at their homes and in their communities. I also 
request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on 
that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8022 of May 19, 2006

World Trade Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Free and fair trade is a powerful engine for growth and job creation in 
the United States and in countries throughout the world. World Trade 
Week is an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of trade for people 
everywhere.
America is a great force for prosperity, and our country's economic and 
national security interests are advanced through strong economic ties 
with our friends and allies. Since 2001, my Administration has concluded 
or implemented free trade agreements with 15 countries. We are working 
toward agreements with 11 additional countries, and we will continue to 
pursue further opportunities.
Last August, I was pleased to sign legislation implementing the 
Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
(CAFTA-DR). CAFTA-DR will reduce tariffs on American goods and expand 
export opportunities for American businesses. When the rules are fair, 
American people and businesses can compete with anyone in the world. 
CAFTA-DR will also advance our commitment to democracy and prosperity 
for our neighbors.
Studies have shown that the elimination of global trade barriers could 
help lift hundreds of millions of the world's poor out of poverty and 
boost economic growth around the world. An important opportunity to 
deliver the full benefits of trade to people around the world is the 
Doha Round of trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization. An 
ambitious Doha agreement could bring benefits to all nations, especially 
the developing world, and my Administration is working for a successful 
conclusion to these negotiations.
During World Trade Week and throughout the year, the United States 
remains committed to increasing free and fair trade and to improving the 
standard of living for our citizens. By working with our friends and 
allies, we will continue to help build a world that lives in liberty, 
trades in freedom, and grows in prosperity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 
2006, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with appropriate events, trade shows, and educational programs that 
celebrate the benefits of trade to our Nation and people around the 
world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Great Outdoors Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Great Outdoors Month is an opportunity to celebrate and experience 
America's natural splendor and renew our commitment to conserve our air, 
water, and land. During this month, we also honor the dedicated men and 
women who volunteer to help protect our natural resources.
Americans live amid many wonders of nature. Our Nation's varied 
landscapes include sandy beaches, expansive forests, emerald waters, and 
towering mountains. Through biking, swimming, skiing, hiking, and many 
other activities, Americans are enjoying our country's magnificent 
scenery and the healthy benefits of outdoor recreation.
To ensure that our natural heritage remains a source of pride for all 
our citizens, my Administration is committed to conserving America's 
public lands and natural resources and pursuing environmentally 
responsible initiatives. We are working to accelerate research into 
cleaner sources of energy, protect our water sources, and encourage the 
use of hybrid cars. We have put in place a series of clean air 
regulations that will help us to meet air quality standards. Through 
efforts like these, we will continue our Nation's economic growth and 
protect the environment.
Our citizens play an important role in protecting our natural spaces. 
Throughout our country, Americans are volunteering in their communities 
for environmental education programs, local parks, nature conservancies, 
and other stewardship opportunities. These devoted individuals are 
working to maintain park trails, restore wildlife habitats, plant trees, 
and clear overgrowth. I appreciate these volunteers for their efforts to 
keep America beautiful, and I encourage all Americans to demonstrate 
good stewardship and an appreciation for the outdoors. Individuals 
interested in volunteering can visit the Department of the Interior's 
Take Pride in America website at takepride.gov.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2006 as Great 
Outdoors Month. I call on all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities and to spend time enjoying the 
outdoors.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of

Proclamation 8024 of May 24, 2006

National Homeownership Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Owning a home is an important part of the American dream. During 
National Homeownership Month, we raise awareness of homeownership and 
encourage more Americans to consider the benefits of owning their own 
home.
Nearly 70 percent of Americans enjoy the satisfaction of owning their 
own home, and my Administration continues to promote an ownership 
society where the promise of America reaches all our citizens. The 
American Dream Downpayment Act of 2003 is helping thousands of low to 
moderate income and minority families with downpayment and closing 
costs, which represent the greatest barrier to homeownership. Since 
2002, when I announced our goal to help 5.5 million minorities become 
homeowners by the end of this decade, the rate of minority homeownership 
has climbed above 50 percent, and more than 2.5 million minority 
families have become new homeowners. My Administration will continue to 
provide counseling and assistance for new homebuyers and expand 
homeownership opportunities for all Americans.
During National Homeownership Month and throughout the year, we applaud 
the men and women who work to achieve the dream of homeownership, and we 
are grateful for those who provide counseling, lending, real estate, 
construction, and other services to these individuals. The hard work, 
financial discipline, and personal responsibility of our country's 
homeowners help transform neighborhoods throughout our Nation and 
reflect the best qualities of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of 
the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 2006 as National 
Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the United States to join 
me in building a more hopeful society and recognizing the importance of 
expanding the ownership of homes across our great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Black Music Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

African-American musicians have added to the rich culture of our country 
and of countries around the world. During Black Music Month, we 
recognize the African-American artists who have enhanced our lives and 
created some of our Nation's most treasured art forms.
Throughout history, African-American artists have produced music with 
the power to change hearts and shape our national conscience. From 
gospel to blues, from jazz to rock and roll, the songs of America's 
black musicians have defined our times and enriched our culture. 
Performers such as Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie and vocalists such as 
Lizzie Miles and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson have made their mark as 
great American musicians, strengthening our Nation's diversity and 
lifting the human spirit.
In 2005, Americans witnessed the power of music to help bring our 
country together. Following the devastation of the Gulf Coast by 
Hurricane Katrina, the musicians of that great region sought to preserve 
their unique musical style and culture and share it with the rest of the 
Nation. The soulful music of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast remains one 
of our national treasures, a symbol of creativity and hope.
Black Music Month recognizes some of the brightest lights of American 
creativity and honors the African-American men and women whose art 
entertains and inspires us. The incredible talents of black musicians 
continue to speak to every heart, reflecting the beauty and pride of our 
great Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2006 as Black Music 
Month. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the history of 
black music and to enjoy the great contributions of African-American 
musicians.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence

Proclamation 8026 of June 1, 2006

National Child's Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A hopeful society ensures that its children are provided with the 
knowledge, skills, and opportunities to succeed. On National Child's 
Day, we reaffirm our commitment to America's children and recognize the 
power that each of us has to make a difference in a young person's life.

[[Page 63]]

The character of a child is formed in the earliest years through the 
love and guidance of family members and other caring individuals. A 
parent, teacher, or mentor can help improve a child's academic 
achievement, encourage right choices, and help them to understand the 
importance of serving a cause greater than self.
Through USA Freedom Corps, my Administration is providing opportunities 
for volunteers to work with children in schools, after-school programs, 
and through community groups and organizations. By volunteering, these 
adults set an example of service and good citizenship for our young 
people and provide youth with the stability and encouragement they need 
to achieve their dreams. My Administration has also launched the 
Community Guide to Helping America's Youth at helpingamericasyouth.gov. 
This web-based tool is part of the Helping America's Youth initiative, 
led by First Lady Laura Bush, and assists communities in identifying 
ways to lend a hand to children in need. In addition, my Administration 
is working through No Child Left Behind and the American Competitiveness 
Initiative to ensure every child has a quality education and the 
opportunity to succeed. By investing in the lives of our young people, 
we can help develop their personal character, teach them to be 
responsible citizens, and enable them to realize their full potential.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 4, 2006, as National Child's Day. I 
call upon citizens to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities. I also urge all the people of the United States to take an 
active role in helping nurture the minds and character of our Nation's 
children.

National Oceans Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Oceans Week, we recognize the importance of the oceans 
to our national heritage, economy, and security and reaffirm our 
commitment to protecting them through wise stewardship and sensible 
management.
The magnificent beauty of the oceans is a blessing to our country and 
the world. The oceans also sustain an abundance of natural and 
historical treasures, enable the transportation of vital goods, and 
provide food and recreation for millions of people. My Administration is 
working with State, tribal, and local governments, the private sector, 
and international partners to foster more effective conservation of our 
oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes resources and to advance the 
environmental, economic, and security interests of our Nation.

[[Page 64]]

On December 17, 2004, I established the Committee on Ocean Policy to 
implement the United States Ocean Action Plan. Through this plan, we are 
building an integrated ocean observing system, promoting ocean 
education, embarking on deep oceans research, supporting our maritime 
transportation system, and enhancing our international leadership role 
in ocean science and policy. We are also advancing legislation to 
strengthen the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
establish a system of sustainable aquaculture, and maintain protections 
for marine mammals. To fulfill my commitment to end overfishing, we are 
working with the Congress to build an improved, market-based system to 
better manage our fisheries and keep our commercial and recreational 
fishing industries strong.
I appreciate all those who are dedicated to making the oceans, coasts, 
and Great Lakes cleaner, healthier, and more productive. By working 
together, all Americans can help sustain the oceans for generations to 
come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 4 through June 10, 2006, as National 
Oceans Week. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more 
about the vital role the oceans play in the life of our country and how 
we can conserve their many natural treasures. I encourage all our 
citizens to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities.

During Caribbean-American Heritage Month, we celebrate the great 
contributions of Caribbean Americans to the fabric of our Nation, and we 
pay tribute to the common culture and bonds of friendship that unite the 
United States and the Caribbean countries.
Our Nation has thrived as a country of immigrants, and we are more 
vibrant and hopeful because of the talent, faith, and values of 
Caribbean Americans. For centuries, Caribbean Americans have enriched 
our society and added to the strength of America. They have been leaders 
in government, sports, entertainment, the arts, and many other fields.
During the month of June, we also honor the friendship between the 
United States and the Caribbean countries. We are united by our common 
values and shared history, and I join all Americans in celebrating the 
rich Caribbean heritage and the many ways in which Caribbean Americans 
have helped shape this Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

Proclamation 8029 of June 6, 2006

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From our Nation's earliest days, Old Glory has stood for America's 
strength, unity, and liberty. During Flag Day and National Flag Week, we 
honor this enduring American symbol and celebrate the hope and ideals 
that it embodies.
In 1777, the Second Continental Congress established the flag of a young 
Nation, whose 13 original states were represented in the flag's 13 stars 
and 13 alternating red and white stripes. Today, the Stars and Stripes 
commemorate the revolutionary truths of our Declaration of Independence 
and Constitution. As Americans, we revere freedom and equality, the 
rights and dignity of every individual, and the supremacy of the rule of 
law. These fundamental beliefs have guided our country and lifted the 
fortunes of all Americans, and we have seen their power to transform 
other nations and deliver hope to people around the world.
During Flag Day and National Flag Week, we also honor the men and women 
who carry our flag into battle. Through their bravery and sacrifice, 
they help keep America safe and advance peace and freedom around the 
globe. By flying the flag, we express our gratitude to these heroes and 
all those who help ensure that the many blessings of our great country 
continue for generations to come.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and 
for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution 
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President 
issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all citizens of the 
United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2006, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 11, 2006, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
suitable

[[Page 66]]

places. I also call upon the people of the United States to observe with 
pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence 
Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor 
America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, 
and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America.

Father's Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

By offering guidance, support, and unconditional love, a father is one 
of the most important influences in a child's life. On Father's Day, we 
honor our fathers and celebrate the special bond between a father and a 
child.
Fathers play a significant role in shaping the character of their 
children and the future of our country. By spending time with their sons 
and daughters and listening to their experiences, fathers can have a 
profound impact on their children's lives. As advisors, role models, and 
friends, fathers help their children to understand the difference 
between right and wrong and to recognize how the decisions they make 
today can affect the rest of their lives. Fathers instill important 
values and prepare young people for the challenges and opportunities 
ahead. Through their daily sacrifices, fathers provide a loving and 
secure home in which their children can grow to become successful adults 
and good citizens. Their love and dedication inspire the next generation 
of Americans to achieve their dreams and demonstrate the true spirit of 
our Nation.

Proclamation 8031 of June 15, 2006

Establishment of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National 
Monument

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the Pacific Ocean northwest of the principal islands of Hawaii lies 
an approximately 1,200 nautical mile stretch of coral islands, 
seamounts, banks, and shoals. The area, including the Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway National 
Wildlife Refuge, the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and the 
Battle of Midway National Memorial, supports a dynamic reef ecosystem 
with more than 7,000 marine species, of which approximately half are 
unique to the Hawaiian Island chain. This diverse ecosystem is home to 
many species of coral, fish, birds, marine mammals, and other flora and 
fauna including the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the threatened green 
sea turtle, and the endangered leatherback and hawksbill sea turtles. In 
addition, this area has great cultural significance to Native Hawaiians 
and a connection to early Polynesian culture worthy of protection and 
understanding.
WHEREAS Executive Order 13089 of June 11, 1998, Executive Order 13178 of 
December 4, 2000, and Executive Order 13196 of January 18, 2001, as well 
as the process for designation of a National Marine Sanctuary undertaken 
by the Secretary of Commerce, have identified objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled 
by the Government of the United States in the area of the Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands;
WHEREAS section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 
431) (the ``Antiquities Act'') authorizes the President, in his 
discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, 
historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or 
scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned or controlled by 
the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and to 
reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all 
cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;
WHEREAS it would be in the public interest to preserve the marine area 
of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and certain lands as necessary for 
the care and management of the historic and scientific objects therein,
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Act of June 
8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), do proclaim that there are hereby 
set apart and reserved as the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine 
National

[[Page 68]]

Monument (the ``monument'' or ``national monument'') for the purpose of 
protecting the objects described above, all lands and interests in lands 
owned or controlled by the Government of the United States within the 
boundaries described on the accompanying map entitled ``Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument'' attached to and forming a 
part of this proclamation. The Federal land and interests in land 
reserved includes approximately 139,793 square miles of emergent and 
submerged lands and waters of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which 
is the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of 
the objects to be protected.
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of this 
monument are hereby appropriated and withdrawn from all forms of entry, 
location, selection, sale, or leasing or other disposition under the 
public land laws, including, but not limited to, withdrawal from 
location, entry, and patent under mining laws, and from disposition 
under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.
The Secretary of Commerce, through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), will have primary responsibility regarding 
management of the marine areas, in consultation with the Secretary of 
the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Fish and 
Wildlife Service (FWS), will have sole responsibility for management of 
the areas of the monument that overlay the Midway Atoll National 
Wildlife Refuge, the Battle of Midway National Memorial, and the 
Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Commerce.
The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior 
(collectively, the ``Secretaries'') shall review and, as appropriate, 
modify the interagency agreement developed for coordinated management of 
the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, signed 
on May 19, 2006. To manage the monument, the Secretary of Commerce, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the State of Hawaii, 
shall modify, as appropriate, the plan developed by NOAA's National 
Marine Sanctuary Program through the public sanctuary designation 
process, and will provide for public review of that plan. To the extent 
authorized by law, the Secretaries, acting through the FWS and NOAA, 
shall promulgate any additional regulations needed for the proper care 
and management of the objects identified above.
The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretaries, shall take 
appropriate action to enter into negotiations with other governments to 
make necessary arrangements for the protection of the monument and to 
promote the purposes for which the monument is established. The 
Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretaries, shall seek the 
cooperation of other governments and international organizations in 
furtherance of the purposes of this proclamation and consistent with 
applicable regional and multilateral arrangements for the protection and 
management of special marine areas. Furthermore, this proclamation shall 
be applied in accordance with international law. No restrictions shall 
apply to or be enforced against a person who is not a citizen, national, 
or resident alien of the United States (including foreign flag vessels) 
unless in accordance with international law.
Nothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to diminish or enlarge the 
jurisdiction of the State of Hawaii.

Proclamation 8032 of June 26, 2006

Independence Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On July 4, 1776, our Nation's Founders declared ``That these United 
Colonies are, and of Right, ought to be free and Independent States.'' 
This declaration marked a great milestone in the history of human 
freedom. On the 230th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of 
Independence, we pay tribute to the courage and dedication of those who 
created this country, and we celebrate the values of liberty and 
equality that make our country strong.
The patriots of the Revolutionary War acted on the beliefs that ``all 
men are created equal'' and ``that they are endowed by their Creator 
with certain unalienable Rights.'' By advancing these ideals, 
generations of Americans have unleashed the hope of freedom for people 
in every corner of the world.
As we celebrate our independence, Americans can take pride in our 
history and look to the future with confidence. We offer our gratitude 
to all the American patriots, past and present, who have sought to 
advance freedom and lay the foundations of peace. Because of their 
sacrifice, this country remains a beacon of hope for all who dream of 
liberty and a shining example to the world of what a free people can 
achieve. May God continue to bless the United States of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 4, 2006, as 
Independence Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
with all due ceremony our Independence Day as a time to honor our 
Founders and their legacy of freedom and remember with thankfulness the 
sacrifice of our men and women in uniform.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8033 of June 30, 2006

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
(the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary developing 
countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary 
developing

[[Page 103]]

countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in 
section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), are 
subject to competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment 
afforded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to eligible 
articles.
2. Section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(C)) 
provides that a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary 
developing country with respect to an eligible article may be 
redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such 
article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the 
competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act 
during the preceding calendar year.
3. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) 
provides that the President may disregard the competitive need 
limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any 
beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the 
imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
4. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that certain beneficiary developing countries have exported certain 
eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive 
need limitation in 2005, and I therefore terminate the duty-free 
treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.
5. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, and subject to the 
considerations set forth in sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined to redesignate certain countries as beneficiary developing 
countries with respect to certain eligible articles that previously had 
been imported in quantities exceeding the competitive need limitations 
of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act.
6. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect 
to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing 
countries, as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.
7. In Proclamation 7758 of March 1, 2004, I determined that Barbados had 
become a ``high income'' country, and terminated the designation of 
Barbados as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, 
effective January 1, 2006. I have determined that an additional change 
should be made to general note 4(d) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
the United States (HTS) to reflect that determination.
8. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including title V and section 604 of the 
1974 Act, do hereby proclaim:

[[Page 104]]

(1) In order to provide that one or more countries that have not been 
treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more 
eligible articles should be redesignated as beneficiary developing 
countries with respect to such article or articles for purposes of the 
GSP, and, in order to provide that one or more countries should no 
longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to 
one or more eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, general note 4(d) 
to the HTS is modified as provided in section A of Annex I to this 
proclamation.
(2) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles for 
purposes of the GSP when imported from any beneficiary developing 
country, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for such HTS subheadings 
is modified as provided in section B(1) of Annex I to this proclamation.
(3) In order to provide that one or more countries should not be treated 
as beneficiary developing countries with respect to certain eligible 
articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn 
for such HTS subheadings is modified as provided for in section B(2) of 
Annex I to this proclamation.
(4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 8035 of July 12, 2006

Parents' Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a child's first teachers, mentors, and role models, parents shape the 
character of those who will help to build the future of our Nation. On 
Parents' Day, we pay tribute to the hard work and sacrifice of the 
millions of devoted parents who provide guidance, support, and 
unconditional love to their children.
Mothers and fathers help kindle imaginations, inspire a love of 
learning, nurture the formation of young minds, and give children the 
courage and the drive to realize their dreams. By instilling in children 
the difference between right and wrong, parents guide their children 
toward developing into

[[Page 109]]

successful adults and responsible citizens who lead lives of purpose. In 
addition, the commitment of parents to the welfare of young people 
strengthens families and communities throughout our great country.
My Administration supports grants and programs to promote healthy 
marriages and responsible fatherhood. The No Child Left Behind Act is 
helping us ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn, and 
recognizes that parental involvement is a vital part of the success of 
schools across America. Federal, State, and local programs, and faith-
based and community groups provide additional resources to help parents 
as they work to raise children of conviction and character.
On this special day, we express our deep gratitude to parents for their 
dedication to a bright and hopeful future for their children. We also 
pray for parents in the military who stand up for America, and we 
resolve that their sacrifice will always be honored by a grateful 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, as 
amended, do hereby proclaim Sunday, July 23, 2006, as Parents' Day. I 
call upon citizens, private organizations, and governmental bodies at 
all levels to engage in activities and educational efforts that 
recognize, support, and honor parents, and I encourage American sons and 
daughters to convey their love, respect, and appreciation to their 
parents.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8036 of July 13, 2006

Captive Nations Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The best hope for peace is the expansion of freedom throughout the 
world. During Captive Nations Week, we reaffirm our commitment to 
advancing liberty, protecting human rights, and helping people realize 
the great promise of democracy.
In proclaiming the first Captive Nations Week in 1959, President Dwight 
Eisenhower said that ``the citizens of the United States are linked by 
bonds of family and principle to those who love freedom and justice on 
every continent.'' Over the past five decades, the force of human 
freedom has overcome hatred and resentment and overthrown tyrants in 
nations around the globe. Freedom is on the march, and today more people 
live in liberty than ever before.
The advance of freedom is the story of our time, and we have witnessed 
remarkable democratic progress in recent years. The people of 
Afghanistan elected their first democratic parliament in more than a 
generation. The

[[Page 110]]

people of Kyrgyzstan drove a corrupt regime from power and voted for 
democratic change. Ending 16 years of civil war and interim governments, 
the people of Liberia were able to go to the polls, electing Africa's 
first female president. The courageous citizens of Iraq reached yet 
another important milestone in their journey towards democracy by 
forming a national unity government based upon the constitution they 
approved last October. In Lebanon, citizens recovered their independence 
and chose their members of parliament in free elections. That newfound 
independence has come under attack in recent days from terrorists and 
their state sponsors, who see freedom and democracy as a threat. The 
United States and its allies will stand with those in Lebanon who 
continue to struggle for their independence and sovereignty and who 
refuse to give over their country to extremism and terror.
At this critical time in the history of freedom, no nation can evade the 
demands of human dignity. In countries like Iran, North Korea, Belarus, 
Burma, Syria, Zimbabwe, and Cuba, governments must become accountable to 
their citizens and embrace democracy. The desire for freedom is written 
in every human heart, and we can be confident that in this century 
freedom will continue to prevail.
This week is also an opportunity to honor those who have stood against 
oppression and advanced the fundamental right of all to live in liberty. 
The courage and sacrifice of these men and women reflect the fact that 
tyranny can never destroy the desire to be free. Inspired by their 
example, we will carry on their work to help others realize the 
universal gift of liberty and to spread the light of democracy to every 
corner of the world.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week in July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 16 through July 22, 2006, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to reaffirm 
their commitment to all those seeking liberty, justice, and self-
determination.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.
GEORGE W. BUSH


<R05>
Proclamation 8037 of July 25, 2006

Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has helped fulfill the promise 
of America for millions of individuals living with disabilities. The 
anniversary of this landmark legislation is an important opportunity to 
celebrate our progress over the last 16 years and the many contributions 
individuals with disabilities make to our country.

[[Page 111]]

When President George H. W. Bush signed the ADA into law on July 26, 
1990, he called this legislation a ``dramatic renewal not only for those 
with disabilities but for all of us, because along with the precious 
privilege of being an American comes a sacred duty to ensure that every 
other American's rights are also guaranteed.'' The ADA's far-reaching 
reforms have played a significant role in enhancing the quality of life 
for millions of Americans who must overcome considerable challenges each 
day in order to participate fully in all aspects of American life.
My Administration continues to build on the progress of the ADA through 
the New Freedom Initiative. We have established an online connection to 
the Federal Government's disability-related information and resources at 
DisabilityInfo.gov, and the job training and placement services of the 
``Ticket to Work'' program and One-Stop Career Centers are promoting 
greater employment opportunities. We are also expanding educational 
opportunities for children with disabilities, providing them with the 
tools they need for success in their classrooms, homes, and communities. 
In addition, we are fostering technological advancement and encouraging 
increased distribution of assistive technology to help people with 
disabilities live and work with greater independence. My Administration 
will continue its efforts to remove barriers confronting Americans with 
disabilities and their families so that every individual can realize 
their full potential.
On this anniversary of the ADA, we underscore our commitment to ensuring 
that the fundamental promises of our democracy are accessible to all our 
citizens. As we strive to be a more caring and hopeful society, let us 
continue to show the character of America in our compassion for one 
another.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2006, as a day in 
celebration of the 16th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. I call on all Americans to celebrate the many contributions of 
individuals with disabilities as we work towards fulfilling the promise 
of the ADA to give all our citizens the opportunity to live with 
dignity, work productively, and achieve their dreams.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8038 of July 27, 2006

50th Anniversary of Our National Motto, ``In God We Trust,'' 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On the 50th anniversary of our national motto, ``In God We Trust,'' we 
reflect on these words that guide millions of Americans, recognize the 
blessings of the Creator, and offer our thanks for His great gift of 
liberty.
From its earliest days, the United States has been a Nation of faith. 
During the War of 1812, as the morning light revealed that the battle-
torn American flag still flew above Fort McHenry, Francis Scott Key 
penned, ``And this be our motto: `In God is our trust!' '' His poem 
became our National Anthem, reminding generations of Americans to 
``Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation.'' On July 
30, 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the law officially 
establishing ``In God We Trust'' as our national motto.
Today, our country stands strong as a beacon of religious freedom. Our 
citizens, whatever their faith or background, worship freely and 
millions answer the universal call to love their neighbor and serve a 
cause greater than self.
As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of our national motto and 
remember with thanksgiving God's mercies throughout our history, we 
recognize a divine plan that stands above all human plans and continue 
to seek His will.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 30, 2006, as the 50th Anniversary of 
our National Motto, ``In God We Trust.'' I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8039 of July 27, 2006

To Implement the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, and for 
Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On September 14, 2004, the United States entered into the United 
States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (USBFTA). The USBFTA was approved by 
the Congress in section 101(a) of the United States-Bahrain Free Trade

[[Page 113]]

Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USBFTA Implementation Act'') (Public 
Law 109-169, 119 Stat. 3581) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note).
2. Section 105(a) of the USBFTA Implementation Act authorizes the 
President to establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an 
office that shall be responsible for providing administrative assistance 
to panels established under Chapter 19 of the USBFTA.
3. Section 201 of the USBFTA Implementation Act authorizes the President 
to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such 
continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional 
duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to 
carry out or apply Articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2.8, and 3.2.9, and the 
schedule of reductions with respect to Bahrain set forth in Annex 2-B of 
the USBFTA.
4. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the USBFTA Implementation Act, 
Bahrain is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary 
developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP). Further, consistent with section 604 of the Trade 
Act of 1974 (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, I have 
determined that other technical and conforming changes to the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) are necessary to reflect that 
Bahrain is no longer eligible to receive benefits of the GSP.
5. Section 202 of the USBFTA Implementation Act provides certain rules 
for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purpose of 
implementing preferential tariff treatment under the USBFTA. I have 
decided that it is necessary to include these rules of origin, together 
with particular rules applicable to certain other goods, in the HTS.
6. Section 204 of the USBFTA Implementation Act authorizes the President 
to take certain enforcement actions relating to trade with Bahrain in 
textile and apparel goods.
7. Sections 321-328 of the USBFTA Implementation Act authorize the 
President to take certain actions in response to a request by an 
interested party for relief from serious damage or actual threat thereof 
to a domestic industry producing certain textile or apparel articles.
8. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, establishes the 
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) to 
supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements.
9. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (the ``USSFTA'') with 
respect to the United States and, pursuant to the United States-
Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USSFTA 
Implementation Act'') (Public Law 108-78, 117 Stat. 948) (19 U.S.C. 3805 
note), incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of 
origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USSFTA.
10. Section 202 of the USSFTA Implementation Act provides rules for 
determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in 
the territory of a USSFTA party and thus are eligible for the tariff and 
other treatment contemplated under the USSFTA. Section 202(o) of the 
USSFTA Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim, as a 
part of the

[[Page 114]]

HTS, the rules of origin set out in the USSFTA and to proclaim 
modifications to such previously proclaimed rules of origin, subject to 
the consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) of the 
USSFTA Implementation Act.
11. The United States and Singapore have agreed to modifications to 
certain USSFTA rules of origin. Modifications to the USSFTA rules of 
origin set out in Proclamation 7747 are therefore necessary.
12. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended, authorizes the President to 
embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or 
other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, 
including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any 
rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 604 of the 1974 Act; sections 105(a), 201, 202, 204, and 321-328 
of the USBFTA Implementation Act; section 202 of the USSFTA 
Implementation Act; and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do 
hereby proclaim:
(1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment 
being accorded under the USBFTA, to set forth rules for determining 
whether goods imported into the customs territory of the United States 
are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the USBFTA, to

Proclamation 8040 of August 21, 2006

Women's Equality Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The ratification of our Constitution's 19th Amendment on August 26, 
1920, marked a turning point for America as women were guaranteed the 
right to vote. On Women's Equality Day, we celebrate this milestone and 
pay tribute to the inspiring individuals who stepped forward and asked 
our Nation to live up to its founding principle of equality for all.
The struggle for women's rights is a story of strong women joining 
together to break down the barriers to equality. With courage and 
determination, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, 
and other suffragists inspired generations of women and helped change 
the path of our Nation's history. The Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 
sparked a mass movement for women's voting rights that gained support 
from women of all ages and backgrounds. In 1890, Wyoming became the 
first State whose constitution allowed women to vote, and by 1918, women 
could vote in 14 additional States. Two years later, women secured 
nationwide suffrage with the passage of the 19th Amendment. By demanding 
participation in the democratic process, these visionaries helped spread 
freedom, justice, and hope for generations to come.
Women today are continuing the suffragists' legacy of leadership and 
strength. They are shaping the future through their contributions to all 
aspects of American life, including science, law, business, education, 
athletics, and the arts. They are serving our Nation with honor and 
distinction in our Armed Forces. American women have served as examples 
for women in other countries in their efforts to increase their 
participation in civic and political life. Our Nation remains committed 
to advancing the equality of women in the world's newest democracies and 
fighting threats to women around the globe.
The courage of American suffragists made our Nation a stronger and more 
hopeful place, and we will continue to build an America where the 
dignity of every person is respected and where opportunity is within 
reach of all our citizens. On Women's Equality Day, we honor the 
contributions and accomplishments of women throughout our history, and 
we pay tribute to all those who helped bring equality to women in 
America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2006, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
celebrate the achievements of women and observe this day with 
appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8041 of August 22, 2006

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we celebrate the 
outstanding progress made by minority business owners, recognize their 
important contributions to our Nation's vibrant economy, and emphasize 
our commitment to helping them succeed.
Throughout our country, minority entrepreneurs strengthen our economic 
growth and keep our Nation moving forward. As Ronald Reagan said, 
entrepreneurs are the ``explorers of the modern era,'' and minority 
business owners help expand opportunities for their communities and 
their fellow citizens. A free society in which people have the 
opportunity to pursue their goals, no matter who they are or where they 
are from, is a stronger and more just society.
Over the past 3 years, our economy has grown by nearly $1.3 trillion, 
and minority businesses have contributed to that growth. Since 2001, my 
Administration has worked with the Congress to deliver the largest tax 
relief in two decades, leaving more money for minority business owners 
to reinvest. We are also undertaking initiatives to widen the ownership 
of businesses. With these resources, minority enterprises are hiring 
more employees, improving their communities, and helping fuel our 
country's economic resurgence.
Minority businesses throughout our Nation remain strong, and our country 
benefits from the positive impact they have on our economy. Minority 
business owners represent the hopeful spirit of America, and all across 
this land, Americans continue to achieve their dreams and build better 
futures for themselves and their families. During Minority Enterprise 
Development Week, we underscore our commitment to helping entrepreneurs 
realize the promise of our great Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 27 through 
September 2, 2006, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon 
all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of our 
Nation's minority enterprises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8042 of August 25, 2006

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Alcohol and drug abuse disrupts families, threatens the safety of our 
neighborhoods, and ruins the lives of countless men, women, and youth. 
During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we recognize 
the damaging effects of substance abuse and renew our support for 
individuals battling to overcome addiction. The theme for 2006, ``Join 
the Voices for Recovery: Build a Stronger, Healthier Community,'' urges 
all Americans to help prevent alcohol and drug abuse and to promote 
treatment and recovery options.
While drug use among youth is down since 2001, we must continue our 
efforts to help our next generation avoid substance abuse. This work 
begins with understanding that youth are less likely to engage in risky 
behaviors when they are connected to strong families and communities. To 
assist our children in learning to make healthy choices, the Helping 
America's Youth initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, is encouraging 
local partnerships that empower families, schools, and communities to 
help our young people reach their full potential.
In order to effectively battle alcohol and drug addiction, we must 
ensure that Americans in need can readily access services and programs. 
Over the past 3 years, my Administration has provided nearly $300 
million for the Access to Recovery program so that individuals who 
desire treatment have the ability to seek the form of treatment most 
suitable for their needs, including assistance from faith-based and 
community providers. My fiscal year 2007 budget proposes to build upon 
the success of this initiative by providing $98 million to further 
expand individual choice.
My Administration is also committed to protecting our citizens and our 
young people from the scourge of methamphetamine. This substance is 
highly addictive and is a continuing and devastating threat in too many 
communities across our Nation. While the number of teens who have ever 
tried this deadly drug has decreased since 2001, we remain focused on 
keeping methamphetamine from reaching more Americans. Through the Access 
to Recovery program, $25 million will be targeted in fiscal year 2007 to 
help individuals recover from methamphetamine abuse. Additionally, 
earlier this year I signed into law the USA PATRIOT Improvement and 
Reauthorization Act of 2005, which increases penalties for smuggling and 
selling methamphetamine and introduces commonsense safeguards to make 
many of the ingredients used in manufacturing it harder to obtain and 
easier to track.
These efforts are helping in the fight against substance abuse in 
America, yet government action is not the only answer. We are making 
progress because there are millions of our fellow citizens answering the 
universal call to love a neighbor. To find out how to join the armies of 
compassion and be a part of building a stronger, healthier community, 
interested volunteers

[[Page 121]]

should visit recoverymonth.gov and usafreedomcorps.gov. By working 
together, we can make a difference in the life of someone in need and 
help fulfill the promise of a more hopeful tomorrow for generations to 
come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2006 as National 
Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8043 of August 25, 2006

National Day of Remembrance of Hurricane Katrina, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One year ago, a vast coastline of towns and communities was virtually 
destroyed; one of America's great cities was submerged; and many lives 
were lost in one of the worst natural disasters in our Nation's history. 
On this National Day of Remembrance of Hurricane Katrina, we honor those 
who did not survive the fury of the storm and those who continue to put 
their lives back together in its aftermath. We also remember the heroism 
of ordinary citizens who touched our hearts with their bravery and 
compassion and moved our whole Nation to action.
Hurricane Katrina brought many days of struggle and sorrow; yet, we also 
witnessed extraordinary acts of courage and kindness. Rescue workers, 
other first responders, and concerned citizens from around the country 
risked their lives to save others and performed heroically under the 
most difficult of circumstances. Many were victims themselves, acting on 
a sense of duty greater than their own suffering. Men, women, and 
children across America rallied to help their neighbors in desperate 
need, providing food, water, shelter, and hope to the victims of 
Hurricane Katrina. Those days tested our Nation, and they revealed a 
resilience more powerful than any storm.
Millions of lives were changed in a day by that cruel and destructive 
storm. America accepted the challenge to restore broken communities and 
disrupted lives not as a burden, but as our responsibility to help our 
fellow citizens. Victims and volunteers continue to demonstrate a spirit 
that cannot be broken--a core of strength that survives all hurt, a 
faith in God that no storm can take away, and an unyielding 
determination to clear the wreckage and build anew.
In the past year, Federal, State, and local governments have worked to 
enhance our Nation's ability to prepare for and respond to natural 
disasters.

[[Page 122]]

The Federal Government has conducted an extensive review of preparedness 
and response efforts, and actions are being taken at every level to 
improve communications and coordination and strengthen emergency 
response capabilities. The American people can know that our government 
is working hard to be prepared to protect life and property should we 
face another such challenge.
In the life of our Nation, we have often been reminded that nature is an 
awesome force, and that all life is fragile. However, Americans have 
always summoned the will and compassion to persevere and rebuild. Guided 
by our enduring American spirit, we know that a bright new dawn will 
rise over the great city of New Orleans, and the entire Gulf Coast 
region will reemerge stronger and more vibrant than ever.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 29, 2006, as a 
National Day of Remembrance of Hurricane Katrina. I call upon State and 
local governments, places of worship, and all Americans to mark this day 
with services and appropriate observances. I also encourage all 
Americans to remember and support the continued effort to rebuild our 
Nation's great Gulf Coast.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8044 of August 29, 2006

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month provides an opportunity to raise 
awareness of risk factors, prevention, and treatment of this deadly 
disease. Our Nation is committed to fighting ovarian cancer, finding its 
cure, and providing hope and healing to those who are affected by it.
While ovarian cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related 
death among women in our country, scientists have made significant 
progress in understanding the factors associated with it. Women of all 
ages can develop this cancer, but studies have shown risk increases with 
age. Other factors associated with ovarian cancer include family 
history, obesity, use of fertility drugs, and a prior occurrence of 
certain cancers. Because the chances of surviving ovarian cancer are 
higher when it is diagnosed and treated in its early stages, women 
should talk to their doctors about risk factors and screenings for this 
disease.
America leads the world in medical research, and we are committed to 
continuing progress in research for prevention, better treatments, and a 
cure for ovarian cancer. This year, the National Institutes of Health 
will invest an estimated $106 million in ovarian cancer research, and 
the National

[[Page 123]]

Cancer Institute is sponsoring clinical trials to explore new ways to 
improve ovarian cancer treatment. The Department of Defense will also 
dedicate an estimated $10 million for its Ovarian Cancer Research 
Program, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will 
invest an estimated $5 million to ovarian cancer research. The CDC is 
additionally partnering with private organizations to sponsor ovarian 
cancer survivor courses for patients, as well as their friends and loved 
ones, following successful cancer treatment.
During National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we honor the victims and 
survivors of this disease for their courage, hope, and perseverance, and 
we thank the families and friends who provide these individuals with 
comfort and care. Our Nation is grateful to medical professionals, 
researchers, and all those whose tireless efforts are making a positive 
difference in the lives of countless women in our country. By working 
together, we can continue to fight ovarian cancer and help more of our 
citizens defeat this devastating disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2006 as National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and the people of the United States to continue our Nation's 
strong commitment to preventing and treating ovarian cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8045 of August 29, 2006

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The United States continues to move forward in its fight against cancer, 
yet an estimated 27,000 American sons, fathers, brothers, and husbands 
will be lost to prostate cancer this year. As we observe National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we underscore our commitment to 
defeating prostate cancer by raising awareness about its risk factors, 
promoting the importance of early detection and treatment, and advancing 
our understanding of the disease and how to stop it.
Medical research has shown that there are steps men can take to reduce 
their chance of developing prostate cancer. For many men, regular 
exercise and healthy eating habits may decrease the likelihood of 
developing this deadly disease. Men over the age of 50, African-American 
men, and men with family medical histories that include prostate cancer 
face the greatest risk--and they can realize the greatest benefits from 
early detection, when treatment is most effective. All men should 
discuss their risk of prostate

[[Page 124]]

cancer with their physicians, determine the best screening and early-
detection options, and adopt healthy lifestyles. Young men are also 
encouraged to find out whether a family member has ever been diagnosed 
with prostate cancer and to seek medical advice at an earlier age if a 
medical history exists.
The progress we have made in the battle against prostate cancer is 
remarkable, yet more work remains. America leads the world in cutting-
edge medical research, and the Federal Government will continue to do 
its part to support work that will lead to better diagnostic tools and 
innovative treatments for prostate cancer. By providing substantial 
funding for programs at the National Institutes of Health, National 
Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 
Department of Defense, my Administration aims to improve our ability to 
prevent, detect, treat, and ultimately cure prostate cancer.
During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, America honors the 
victims and survivors of prostate cancer and applauds the family members 
and friends who provide love and encouragement. We also commend the 
medical professionals and researchers who are working to administer 
care, improve treatments, and find cures. Prostate cancer can be 
defeated, and we will continue this fight until the day when the battle 
to beat prostate cancer has been won.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2006 as National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, and the 
people of the United States to reaffirm our Nation's strong and ongoing 
campaign against prostate cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
August in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.

Proclamation 8046 of September 5, 2006

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year, we mark the fifth anniversary of the brutal and ruthless 
terrorist attacks carried out against our Nation on September 11, 2001. 
We will always remember the thousands of lives lost, and the innocent 
men, women, and children forever changed by those acts of evil. During 
these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we honor the heroism of 
the police officers, firefighters, rescue personnel, members of the 
military, and private citizens who responded selflessly in the face of 
terror. We also honor the courage and spirit of the mothers and fathers, 
sons and daughters, brothers

[[Page 125]]

and sisters, and husbands and wives who continue to grieve for their 
irreplaceable loss.
As we pray for the families of the victims and reflect upon that 
defining moment in our history, we are inspired by the knowledge that 
from the pain and sorrow of that September morning rose a Nation united 
by our love for freedom. We remember that we are a people determined to 
defend our way of life and to care for our neighbors in need. The scenes 
of distress and devastation we witnessed in the heart of New York City, 
at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania were overcome by sacrifice, 
bravery, and compassion. We resolved to answer history's call to bring 
justice to our enemies and to ensure the survival and success of 
liberty. Since that day, we have confronted a murderous ideology by 
taking the fight to our adversaries and by spreading the universal hope 
of freedom to millions around the world.
We are grateful for the service and sacrifice of the men and women of 
our Armed Forces who are advancing liberty and protecting our country, 
and we pray for their safety. We ask that God continue to comfort the 
families of those who have lost their lives or who have been injured 
while defending our freedom. We will succeed in this struggle against 
evil, and the legacy of peace we leave behind will be the greatest 
memorial to the victims of September 11, 2001, and all those who have 
paid the ultimate price while wearing our Nation's uniform.
On these Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we mourn with those who still 
mourn, and find comfort through faith. We give thanks to the Almighty 
for our liberty, and we pray for His blessing on all those who were lost 
and for strength in the work ahead. May God continue to watch over the 
United States of America, and may His will guide us in the days to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 8, 
through Sunday, September 10, 2006, as National Days of Prayer and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States and their places 
of worship mark these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance with 
memorial services, the ringing of bells, and evening candlelight 
remembrance vigils. I also invite the people of the world to share in 
these Days of Prayer and Remembrance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8047 of September 7, 2006

Patriot Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On the fifth anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, we recall 
the fire and horror at the twin towers of the World Trade Center, the 
Pentagon, and a Pennsylvania field. America will always remember the 
thousands of innocent lives taken by the enemies of freedom that 
morning.
In the face of these unspeakable attacks, we were reminded that the 
great strength of America is found in the hearts and souls of our 
citizens. We witnessed firefighters, police officers, other public 
safety officials, and ordinary Americans demonstrate extraordinary 
courage, risking their lives to save innocent victims. We saw our 
country united in compassion as Americans came together to provide 
relief and bring hope to others.
Today, America is fighting a war that is testing our Nation's resolve. 
We are once again answering history's call with confidence, and we know 
that freedom will prevail. Our brave men and women in uniform have 
stepped forward to fight our enemies abroad so that we do not have to 
face them here at home, and we are grateful for the courageous 
individuals bringing terrorists to justice around the world.
We are also confronting the extremists in the great ideological struggle 
of the 21st century. September the 11th made clear that, in the long 
run, the only way to secure our Nation is to advance liberty and 
democracy as the great alternatives to repression and radicalism. By 
working together with our friends and allies, we are helping spread the 
blessings of freedom and laying the foundations of peace for generations 
to come.
The events of September 11, 2001, will always be a defining moment in 
our history. We hold the victims and their families in our hearts, and 
we lift them up in our prayers.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as ``Patriot 
Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2006, as Patriot Day. I call 
upon the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of government, to 
direct that the flag be flown at half staff on Patriot Day. I also call 
upon the people of the United States to observe Patriot Day with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and remembrance services, to display 
the flag at half staff from their homes on that day, and to observe a 
moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor 
the innocent Americans and people from around the world who lost their 
lives as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8048 of September 8, 2006

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Education is the cornerstone of a prosperous and hopeful Nation. By 
providing a quality education, Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs) help students achieve their dreams and realize the 
promise of America. During National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week, we recognize the significant contributions of HBCUs 
and underscore our commitment to helping these distinguished 
institutions in the pursuit of educational excellence.
Our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities are places of 
higher learning and achievement that prepare new generations of 
Americans to become responsible leaders in their communities and around 
the world. HBCUs enable students to gain the skills necessary to compete 
for the jobs of the 21st century.
My Administration is dedicated to ensuring the continued success of 
HBCUs and securing the constitutional guarantees of liberty and equality 
to all Americans. The President's Board of Advisors on Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities has worked to help these institutions 
benefit from Federal programs, obtain private-sector support for their 
endowments, and build partnerships to strengthen faculty development and 
cooperative research. In addition, the HBCU Capital Financing Program 
provides HBCUs with access to funds for the repair, renovation, and 
construction of educational resources and facilities.
During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we 
celebrate the enduring importance of HBCUs, and resolve to continue to 
support their critical mission.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 10 through 
September 16, 2006, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this week with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in recognition of the 
vital contributions of HBCUs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of

Proclamation 8049 of September 14, 2006

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans are a diverse people, yet we are bound by common principles 
that teach us what it means to be American citizens. During National 
Hispanic Heritage Month, we recognize the many contributions of Hispanic 
Americans to our country.
Through hard work, faith in God, and a deep love of family, Hispanic 
Americans have pursued their dreams and contributed to the strength and 
vitality of our Nation. They have enriched the American experience and 
excelled in business, law, politics, education, community service, the 
arts, science, and many other fields. Hispanic entrepreneurs are also 
helping build a better, more hopeful future for all by creating jobs 
across our country. The number of Hispanic-owned businesses is growing 
at three times the national rate, and increasing numbers of Hispanic 
Americans own their own homes. We continue to benefit from a rich 
Hispanic culture and we are a stronger country because of the talent and 
creativity of the many Hispanic Americans who have shaped our society.
Throughout our history, Hispanic Americans have also shown their 
devotion to our country in their military service. Citizens of Hispanic 
descent have fought in every war since our founding and have taken their 
rightful place as heroes in our Nation's history. Today, Americans of 
Hispanic descent are serving in our Armed Forces with courage and honor, 
and their efforts are helping make America more secure and bringing 
freedom to people around the world.
As we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, we applaud the 
accomplishments of Hispanic Americans and recognize the contributions 
they make to our great land. To honor the achievements of Hispanic 
Americans, the Congress, by Public Law 100-402, as amended, has 
authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation 
designating September 15 through October 15 as ``National Hispanic 
Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through 
October 15, 2006, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon 
public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the 
United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8050 of September 14, 2006

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans are united by the principles embodied in the United States 
Constitution. On Constitution Day and Citizenship Day and during 
Constitution Week, we celebrate the establishment of the United States 
Constitution and honor the Framers of this groundbreaking document.
In 1787, the Framers of the Constitution met in Philadelphia and drafted 
a document that continues to be the foundation of our Nation's identity. 
The Constitution established the enduring governmental framework in 
which our free society has flourished for more than two centuries, and 
it is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of our Founders.
America is grateful to those who have worked to defend the Constitution 
and promote its ideals. During this observance, we also recognize the 
profound impact our Constitution has on the everyday lives of our 
citizens, and we call upon all Americans to help uphold its values of a 
free and just society.
In celebration of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 
U.S.C. 106, as amended), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day 
and Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 
U.S.C. 108, as amended), requested that the President proclaim the week 
beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as 
``Constitution Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2006, as Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2006, as 
Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as 
well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to 
conduct ceremonies and programs that celebrate our Constitution and 
reaffirm our rights and responsibilities as citizens of our great 
Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8051 of September 14, 2006

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we look to our service men and women as examples of courage 
and sacrifice. When our country and the world have needed brave 
Americans to advance the cause of freedom, our men and women in uniform 
have proudly stepped forward and selflessly endured hardships to defend 
liberty. We are grateful to all who have served, and on National POW/MIA 
Recognition Day, we give special honor to the extraordinary patriots who 
have been prisoners of war and to those who are still missing in action. 
We take inspiration from their valor and loyalty and will not rest until 
we have accounted for them all.
On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, the National League of Families 
POW/MIA flag is flown over the White House, the Capitol, the Departments 
of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 
Korean War Veterans Memorial, World War II Memorial, U.S. military 
installations, national cemeteries, and other locations across our 
country. The POW/MIA flag is a symbol of our Nation's resolve never to 
forget the service and great sacrifice of the heroes who have carried 
out liberty's urgent and noble mission, even at the cost of their own 
freedom. On this day, we express our deep appreciation to each of our 
Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines and our enduring commitment to 
achieve the fullest possible accounting for all of our men and women in 
uniform who have been prisoners of war or are missing in action.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States do hereby proclaim Friday, September 15, 2006, 
as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I call upon the people of the 
United States to join me in paying solemn tribute to all former American 
prisoners of war and those missing in action who valiantly served our 
great country. I call upon Federal, State, and local government 
officials and private organizations to observe this day with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the

Proclamation 8052 of September 15, 2006

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Generations of farmers and ranchers have strengthened our Nation and 
enriched our communities by providing us with food, raw materials, and 
energy. National Farm Safety and Health Week is an opportunity to 
celebrate their contributions to America and raise awareness about 
potential hazards these workers and their families face. This year's 
theme, ``Prepare to Prevent,'' underscores the importance of injury 
prevention, preparedness, and safety on farms and ranches.
Farming and ranching are challenging occupations. Agricultural workers 
often work long hours and are exposed to many dangers associated with 
heavy machinery, tools, livestock, chemicals, and extreme weather 
conditions. By identifying hazards and taking preventive measures, 
farmers and ranchers can create a safer environment for themselves and 
their employees. Wearing protective gear can help prevent injuries, and 
farm machinery can be equipped with safety devices to decrease 
accidents. Agricultural workers can also take steps to make their 
workplace safer by training family members and staff in first aid and 
other emergency response techniques.
Our country depends on farmers and ranchers to help provide an abundant 
and safe food supply for our citizens and for the world, and we are 
grateful to them for their significant contributions to the economic 
prosperity of our great Nation. By raising awareness about injury 
prevention and safety in the workplace, farmers and ranchers can protect 
their employees, families, and themselves, and continue their good work 
to help America stay productive and prosperous.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17 through 
September 23, 2006, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the agencies, organizations, and businesses that serve America's 
agricultural workers to continue to strengthen their commitment to 
promoting farm safety and health programs. I also urge all Americans to 
honor our agricultural heritage and to recognize our farmers and 
ranchers for their remarkable contributions to our Nation's prosperity 
and strength.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8053 of September 15, 2006

Literacy Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The ability to read is the gateway to educational excellence and a key 
to success in any democratic society. On Literacy Day, we recognize the 
vital importance of literacy to our Nation and affirm our commitment to 
helping improve the lives of the men, women, and children in America and 
around the world who cannot read.
Our society has a responsibility to ensure individuals have the 
educational opportunities to learn to read. Literacy is a basic 
requirement for healthy societies and enables people to better care for 
themselves and their families. Reading also encourages participation in 
the democratic process and helps people reach their full potential 
through self-reliance and independence.
 My Administration is committed to helping children and adults gain the 
reading skills they need to succeed in life. Through No Child Left 
Behind programs such as Reading First, Early Reading First, and Striving 
Readers, we are challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations and 
helping to provide students with the foundation to achieve their dreams. 
Reading also helps adults to be better consumers, and wider literacy 
increases economic participation, which helps to create more stable and 
vibrant economies. The White House Conference on Global Literacy, led by 
First Lady Laura Bush, is working to promote literacy for individuals of 
all ages and help give people around the world the skills necessary for 
success. By increasing literacy, we can help change lives and equip all 
people with the knowledge and tools to excel in the 21st century.
On Literacy Day, we recognize the great value of reading and encourage 
individuals around the world to take an active role in promoting 
literacy. Together, we can build a stronger society and a bright future 
for people everywhere.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18, 2006, as 
Literacy Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this day with programs and activities that advance literacy for 
Americans and all the people of the world. By donating books to local 
libraries, volunteering to tutor, supporting international literacy 
programs, and fostering a learning environment in the home, citizens 
across this great Nation can make a difference and help their fellow 
Americans and people throughout the world enjoy the benefits of 
literacy.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8054 of September 20, 2006

Gold Star Mother's Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since America's founding, every generation has produced patriots willing 
to sacrifice for our great Nation. Many of these proud sons and 
daughters have given everything for our freedom, and America has mourned 
the loss of every life. On Gold Star Mother's Day, we pay special 
tribute to the mothers of those lost while defending our country and 
extending the blessings of liberty to others.
Gold Star Mothers have long borne the hardships of war with dignity and 
devotion. Through heartbreaking loss and unimaginable grief, they 
continue to support each other through difficult times, stand up for 
those wearing the uniform of the United States, and serve their 
communities in the best traditions of the American spirit. Their 
strength, compassion, and determination are an inspiration to all and a 
source of great pride for our Nation.
America lives in freedom because of the sacrifices of America's finest 
citizens and of the mothers who raised them. In the words of President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, ``There is nothing adequate which anyone 
in any place can say to those who are entitled to display the gold star 
in their windows.'' Each year, this observance is an opportunity to 
offer our solemn respect to Gold Star Mothers and renew our ongoing 
pledge that America will always remember those who died while wearing 
the uniform of the United States and forever honor their families' 
sacrifice.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold 
Star Mother's Day'' and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in its observance. On this day, we express our deep 
gratitude to our Nation's Gold Star Mothers, and we ask God's blessings 
on them and on their families.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 24, 2006, as Gold Star 
Mother's Day. I call upon all Government officials to display the flag 
of the United States over Government buildings on this solemn day. I 
also encourage the American people to display the flag and hold 
appropriate ceremonies as a public expression of our Nation's sympathy 
and respect for our Gold Star Mothers.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8055 of September 21, 2006

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In times of war or crisis, the citizen-soldiers of our National Guard 
and Reserve are ready and willing to answer the call of duty. During 
National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we express our 
deep gratitude to these brave men and women and to the employers who 
support them and enable them to serve.
Members of the National Guard and Reserve put on the uniform of the 
United States when our country needs them most. In the war on terror, 
thousands of these civilians from all walks of life have been called 
away from their jobs and families and mobilized for duty around the 
world. They are performing many different missions, but all are working 
to deliver the blessings of freedom to people who have not known 
liberty.
Here at home, the National Guard is working to protect our borders, and 
National Guard personnel and Reservists help rebuild communities and 
bring comfort, security, and healing to individuals in the aftermath of 
hurricanes and other natural disasters. The dedicated service of our 
National Guard and Reserve personnel is vital to the security of our 
Nation, and these patriots are an inspiration and source of pride to all 
Americans.
We also appreciate the commitment of the civilian employers of these 
courageous men and women. By providing time off, pay, health care 
benefits, and job security, these employers help members of the National 
Guard and Reserve and their families serve our country and prepare for 
their return to civilian life. In offices, schools, factories, and small 
businesses across America, employers operate without some of their most 
talented people, and America appreciates their support and the support 
they provide to their employees in our National Guard and Reserve.
National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week is an important 
opportunity to express our country's debt of gratitude to the men and 
women of the National Guard and Reserve and to all the employers who 
stand behind these dedicated individuals.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24 through 
September 30, 2006, as National Employer Support of the Guard and 
Reserve Week. I encourage all Americans to join me in expressing our 
thanks to members of our National Guard and Reserve and their civilian 
employers for their patriotic sacrifice on behalf of our Nation. I also 
call upon State and local officials, private organizations, businesses, 
and all military commanders to observe this week with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 8056 of September 22, 2006

Family Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Families instill values, shape character, and are the foundation of a 
hopeful society. On Family Day, we celebrate the rich traditions of 
family life and emphasize the importance of stable and loving 
relationships between children and parents.
Families are a source of inspiration and strength, and they provide hope 
and solace in the face of adversity. Children especially benefit from 
the bonds of family. During critical times in children's lives, family 
members encourage them to aim high and achieve their dreams, herald 
their successes, and promote positive behavior. Through their guidance 
and support, family members prepare young people for the challenges and 
opportunities ahead.
Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other caregivers are the first 
line of defense in helping young people avoid the dangers and 
temptations they face each day. By being attentive to children's 
activities and choices, families can help young people grow into 
successful adults.
My Administration remains committed to strengthening American families. 
We are working to protect the institution of marriage, promote 
responsible fatherhood, encourage parents to be involved in the 
education of their children, and provide every child with the 
opportunity to learn. By helping America's families thrive, we can build 
a brighter future for our country and give our young people the 
foundation they need to make good choices and build lives of purpose.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 25, 2006, as 
Family Day. I call on the people of the United States to observe this 
day by reflecting on the blessings of family and participating in family 
activities that strengthen relationships between children and parents.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the

Proclamation 8057 of September 28, 2006

Child Health Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's young people enjoy a future of hope and promise, and we must 
be committed to supporting them through each opportunity and challenge 
they face ahead. Each year on Child Health Day, we emphasize the 
importance of keeping our children safe, encouraging them to practice 
healthy habits, and educating and empowering them to avoid risky 
behavior.
Parents are children's first teachers, and they play a crucial role in 
promoting good health and helping young people grow into responsible, 
moral, and productive adults. Violence, illegal drugs, alcohol, smoking, 
and early sexual activity are some of the top causes of disease and 
early death among our youth. By being vigilant and talking with their 
children about the issues they face, parents can teach children to make 
the right decisions when they are challenged by peer pressure or tempted 
to participate in dangerous activities.
My Administration recognizes the importance of investing in the health 
and well-being of our young people, and we remain committed to helping 
our children build healthy and successful lives. Through the Helping 
America's Youth Initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, we are 
encouraging children to make good choices, educating parents and 
communities on the importance of positive youth development, and 
supporting organizations that are dedicated to the success of America's 
children.
Every day, parents strive to raise their children to be strong and 
successful adults. By working together, families, teachers, mentors, and 
government and community leaders can help ensure young people enjoy the 
opportunity to have long and healthy lives.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in 
October as ``Child Health Day'' and has requested the President to issue 
a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 2, 2006, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon families, schools, child health professionals, faith-
based and community organizations, and State and local governments to 
reach out to our Nation's young people, encourage them to avoid 
dangerous behavior, and help make the right choices to achieve their 
dreams.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8058 of September 29, 2006

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Domestic violence has no place in our society, and we have a moral 
obligation to help prevent it. The terrible tragedies that result from 
it destroy lives and insult the dignity of women, men, and children. 
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month is an opportunity to 
underscore our commitment to bringing an end to violence in the home.
A home should be a place of stability, comfort, and love. Domestic 
violence shatters this important foundation. My Administration is 
strongly committed to addressing domestic violence and helping those who 
have been victimized. In January, I was proud to sign legislation 
reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Since I announced the 
Family Justice Center Initiative in 2003, we have opened 11 Family 
Justice Centers across the country. These centers offer services to 
victims and their families, including legal advice, counseling, and 
support. In addition, we are continuing to work with faith-based and 
community organizations to provide training, expertise, and funding to 
help deliver hope and healing to those who need it most.
During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month and throughout the 
year, we are grateful for the advocates, counselors, and others who 
provide care to those affected by these acts of cruelty and for the law 
enforcement personnel and others who work to bring offenders to justice. 
We extend our compassion to the victims of domestic violence and urge 
them to seek assistance through local Family Justice Centers, faith-
based and community organizations, and the National Domestic Violence 
Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE. By working together, we can build an America 
where every home honors the value and dignity of its loved ones.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2006 as National 
Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to reach out to 
victims and help end domestic violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of

Proclamation 8059 of October 3, 2006

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we underscore our 
commitment to advancing the fight against breast cancer and bringing 
hope to those affected by this deadly disease.
Breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among 
American women, and both men and women should be aware that age, 
obesity, genetics, and family history are factors that can contribute to 
the risk of developing this disease. Individuals may help reduce their 
personal risk of breast cancer through regular exercise and healthy 
lifestyle choices. Also, regular self-exams, clinical breast exams, and 
mammograms are vital since treatments are most effective when breast 
cancer is detected early.
Our Nation is making advances in the detection and treatment of breast 
cancer, and my Administration is committed to continuing this progress. 
In fiscal year 2007, the Department of Health and Human Services will 
spend nearly $844 million on breast cancer research and prevention 
activities. In addition, the Federal Government is promoting breast 
cancer screening services for low-income and uninsured women through 
outreach activities and educational materials.
Throughout our Nation, compassionate citizens provide love and 
encouragement to individuals living with breast cancer and their loved 
ones. Survivors of this disease show the world that life after breast 
cancer can be a reality, and we must continue to support these 
individuals and their families. Through medical advances, preventative 
programs, and quality health care, we can continue to make significant 
strides in the fight against this devastating disease and provide a 
brighter future for many Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States, by 
virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the 
United States, do hereby proclaim October 2006 as National Breast Cancer 
Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, businesses, 
communities, health care professionals, educators, volunteers, and all 
the people of the United States to continue our Nation's strong 
commitment to preventing and treating breast cancer and to finding a 
cure for this disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the

Proclamation 8060 of October 3, 2006

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Disability Employment Awareness Month, we pay tribute to 
the accomplishments of the men and women with disabilities whose work 
helps keep America's economy strong, and we underscore our commitment to 
ensuring equal employment opportunity for all of our citizens.
Our country has made great progress to ensure that opportunities are 
accessible to everyone who is willing and able to work. Access to jobs 
was significantly expanded in 1990 when President George H. W. Bush 
signed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) into law. This 
important legislation has served as a foundation for strengthening our 
Nation's workforce and advancing innovation and American leadership in a 
global marketplace.
In 2001, my Administration announced the New Freedom Initiative to build 
on the progress of the ADA and more fully integrate men and women with 
disabilities into all aspects of life. The New Freedom Initiative has 
helped expand access to technology, training, and education for citizens 
with disabilities. As a result, those who have a disability and seek 
employment are better able to compete for jobs. To assist in providing 
additional access to employment opportunities, we have also implemented 
the ``Ticket to Work'' program and strengthened training and employment 
services at One-Stop Career Centers. By visiting DisabilityInfo.gov, 
individuals and employers can learn more about the Federal Government's 
disability-related programs and receive information and resources they 
need to help achieve their personal and professional ambitions.
To recognize the contributions of Americans with disabilities and to 
encourage all citizens to ensure equal opportunity in the workforce, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved as amended (36 U.S.C. 121), has 
designated October of each year as ``National Disability Employment 
Awareness Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2006 as National 
Disability Employment Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, 
labor leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe 
this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the

Proclamation 8061 of October 3, 2006

German-American Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, the spirit and hard work of German Americans 
have been an important part of the cultural fabric of our Nation. On 
German-American Day, we celebrate German Americans and their many 
contributions to the character of our country.
Germans were among the first to settle in this great land of promise, 
and their talent, faith, and strong values helped establish this country 
as a place of freedom and opportunity. Today, millions of German 
Americans are adding to the success and prosperity of our Nation as 
leaders in government, sports, business, science, the arts, and many 
other fields.
In every generation, German Americans have courageously stepped forward 
to serve in our country's hour of need. During the Revolutionary War, 
General Friedrich von Steuben helped train the Continental Army for 
battle, and in World War II, great men like General Dwight Eisenhower 
and Admiral Chester Nimitz helped lead the Allied Forces to victory. Our 
Nation will always be grateful to the many German Americans who have 
selflessly answered the call to defend liberty and advance the cause of 
freedom as members of our Armed Forces. The sacrifices of these heroes 
help preserve the ideals of our country's founding and make the world a 
safer place.
German-American Day is also an opportunity to recognize the friendship 
between Germany and the United States. By working together as partners 
in peace with a mutual commitment to liberty, the United States and 
Germany can lay the foundation for a more hopeful tomorrow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2006, as 
German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to celebrate our Nation's 
German heritage and the many ways German Americans have enriched and 
strengthened our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of

During Fire Prevention Week, we underscore our commitment to advancing 
fire safety and awareness, and we honor the brave firefighters and 
volunteers who work to protect our lives, homes, and communities.
Thousands of injuries and deaths occur each year as a result of fires, 
and Americans have a shared responsibility to help minimize the risk of 
fires that can cause harm to people and property. By installing and 
maintaining smoke alarms and having a plan of action in the event of an 
emergency, citizens can practice simple but effective fire safety 
measures. Unattended cooking is a leading cause of household fires, and 
this year's theme, ``Prevent Cooking Fires: Watch What You Heat,'' 
highlights the importance of practicing kitchen safety at all times. By 
keeping cooking areas clear of flammable items and closely monitoring 
children and appliances while in the kitchen, individuals can greatly 
reduce the number of fire-related accidents in the home.
Our Nation's firefighters selflessly risk their lives to protect their 
fellow citizens. These brave men and women play a critical role in 
safeguarding our families, our households, and our communities, and 
their courage and dedication are an inspiration to all Americans. Fire 
Prevention Week is an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of fire 
safety, celebrate those who devote their lives to protecting others, and 
honor the memory of our Nation's fallen heroes.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 8 through October 
14, 2006, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 8, 2006, in 
accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be 
flown at half-staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the 
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans 
to participate in this observance through appropriate programs and 
activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their 
tragic consequences.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8063 of October 4, 2006

Leif Erikson Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Leif Erikson Day honors a great son of Iceland and grandson of Norway 
who became one of the first Europeans known to reach North America. This 
day is also an opportunity to celebrate the generations of Nordic 
Americans who have contributed to our country and strengthened the ties 
that forever bind the United States with Denmark, Finland, Iceland, 
Norway, and Sweden.
Like the crew of risk takers that Leif Erikson boldly led on a quest to 
find new lands, Americans have always valued the ideals of exploration 
and discovery. A desire to seek and understand inspired their voyage 
more than a millennium ago, and it remains a central part of our 
national character as a new generation pursues great new goals today. 
Nordic Americans continue to make valuable contributions to our society 
that have expanded human knowledge and helped make our world a better 
place.
To honor Leif Erikson and to celebrate our citizens of Nordic-American 
heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved 
on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President to proclaim October 9 
of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2006, as Leif Erikson Day. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8064 of October 5, 2006

National School Lunch Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For 60 years, the National School Lunch Program has contributed to the 
health and well-being of America's youth. National School Lunch Week 
highlights the many achievements of the National School Lunch Program 
and the importance of helping children develop good nutrition habits.
Eating healthy foods and maintaining an active lifestyle are vital for 
children's health and reduce their risk of serious long-term health 
problems, such as obesity, asthma, and diabetes. The National School 
Lunch Program, part of the United States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), provides more

[[Page 143]]

than 29 million children with healthy meals each day. The program raises 
awareness about the importance of good food choices and trains food 
service professionals to prepare nutritious breakfasts, lunches, and 
snacks that include foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. In 
addition, the USDA offers educational resources for school nutrition 
directors, managers, and staff based on the requirements for healthy 
school meals established in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. By 
promoting good nutrition and exercise, schools can help children develop 
well-balanced diets and lead healthier lives.
During National School Lunch Week, we recognize dedicated parents, 
school officials, community leaders, and food service professionals for 
their efforts to ensure that our children are provided with nutritious 
meals each day.
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch Program 
to the health, education, and well-being of America's children, the 
Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), as 
amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in 
October of each year as ``National School Lunch Week,'' and has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 8 through October 14, 
2006, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join 
the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch 
Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being 
of our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8065 of October 5, 2006

Columbus Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than five centuries ago, Christopher Columbus boldly set out on a 
long and challenging journey across the Atlantic that led the way for 
exploration of the Americas. On Columbus Day, we celebrate the historic 
voyages of the Italian explorer and honor his life, heritage, and 
lasting legacy.
Columbus' brave expeditions expanded the horizons of human knowledge and 
inspired generations of risk-takers and pioneers in America and around 
the world. Our Nation is built on the efforts of men and women who 
possess both the vision to see beyond what is and the desire to pursue 
what might be. Today, the same passion for discovery that drove Columbus 
is leading bold visionaries to explore the frontiers of space, find new 
energy sources, and solve our most difficult medical challenges.

[[Page 144]]

Columbus Day is also an opportunity to celebrate the heritage we share 
with the legendary explorer, the important relationship between the 
United States and Italy, and the proud Italian Americans who call our 
Nation home. Italian Americans have strengthened our country and 
enriched our culture, and through service in our Armed Forces, many have 
defended our Nation with courage and helped lay the foundation of peace 
for generations to come.
In commemoration of Columbus' journey, the Congress, by joint resolution 
of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has 
requested that the President proclaim the second Monday of October of 
each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2006, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8066 of October 11, 2006

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we remember Casimir Pulaski, a Polish-
born hero of the American Revolution who fought and died for the freedom 
and independence our country enjoys today.
General Casimir Pulaski entered into a campaign against tyranny in 
Poland in 1768, bravely fighting for the freedom of his native land. 
This patriotic spirit and thirst for freedom remained with Pulaski 
throughout his life and influenced his success in the American 
Revolutionary War. After meeting Benjamin Franklin in Paris, Pulaski 
traveled to America to join forces with General George Washington and 
assist in the fight for American independence. He was quickly 
commissioned as a Brigadier General and demonstrated such skill on the 
battlefield that he became known as the ``Father of the American 
Cavalry.'' In 1779, General Pulaski was mortally wounded at the siege of 
Savannah. By giving his life for our country, General Pulaski inspired 
many Americans and helped ensure a future of freedom for our citizens.
Through his service and dedication to liberty, General Pulaski 
demonstrated the strong will and patriotism that made our freedom 
possible, and the ties between the United States and Poland are 
strengthened by these common values. On General Pulaski Memorial Day, we 
honor the

[[Page 145]]

courage and sacrifice of this great hero of the American Revolution, 
recognize the many contributions of Polish Americans to our country, and 
celebrate the lasting friendship between our two great nations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2006, as 
General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage Americans to commemorate this 
occasion with appropriate programs and activities honoring General 
Casimir Pulaski and all those who defend our freedom.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8067 of October 11, 2006

To Modify Rules of Origin Under the North American Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (the ``NAFTA'') with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182) (the ``NAFTA Implementation 
Act''), incorporated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (the ``HTS'') the tariff modifications and rules of origin 
necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
2. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides 
rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States 
originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for 
the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA. Section 
202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes 
the President to proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the rules of origin set 
out in the NAFTA and to proclaim modifications to such previously 
proclaimed rules of origin, subject to the consultation and layover 
requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 
U.S.C. 3313(a)).
3. The United States, Canada, and Mexico have agreed to modifications to 
certain NAFTA rules of origin. Modifications to the NAFTA rules of 
origin reflected in general note 12 to the HTS are therefore necessary.
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts 
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the 
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or 
other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution

[[Page 146]]

and the laws of the United States, including section 604 of the 1974 Act 
and section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act, do hereby proclaim:
(1) In order to reflect in the HTS modifications to the rules of origin 
under the NAFTA, general note 12 to the HTS is modified as provided in 
the Annex to this proclamation.
(2) The modifications made by this proclamation shall be effective with 
respect to goods of Canada or of Mexico, under the terms of general note 
12 to the HTS, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after July 1, 2006.
(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8068 of October 12, 2006

National Energy Awareness Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation is moving toward remarkable technological advances that will 
make energy cleaner, more abundant, and more affordable for our 
citizens. During National Energy Awareness Month, we underscore our 
commitment to a more secure energy future.
My Administration is working to improve energy efficiency and 
conservation, increase our domestic supply of energy, and diversify our 
energy supply through advanced technologies. Since 2001, we have 
invested nearly $10 billion in the development of cleaner, less 
expensive, and more reliable energy sources. We developed a 
comprehensive National Energy Policy, and last year I signed into law 
the Energy Policy Act of 2005 -- the first comprehensive energy bill in 
more than a decade.
My Administration's Advanced Energy Initiative seeks to diversify energy 
resources by substantially increasing funding for clean-energy research. 
To change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in 
zero-emission coal-fired plants, revolutionary solar and wind 
technologies, and clean, safe nuclear energy. We will focus on improving 
hybrid and hydrogen technologies for our automobiles and increasing the 
use of biofuels. By harnessing the power of technology, we can grow our 
economy, protect our environment, and enhance our energy security.
Technology is also helping develop new energy-saving products that give 
our consumers better performance at a lower cost. At home, energy-
efficient windows reduce the loss of hot and cold air, and high 
efficiency light-bulbs last longer than traditional bulbs while 
requiring less electricity. The Federal Government's Energy Savers 
website, energysavers.gov, offers more information about how to use less 
energy in homes, offices, and vehicles, and how consumers can save money 
on energy costs.
Meeting our growing energy needs will require creativity, determination, 
and discipline. By working together, we can foster economic growth, 
improve our environment, and leave behind a safer, cleaner, more 
prosperous world for future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2006 as National 
Energy Awareness Month. I encourage Americans to take steps to conserve 
energy and develop responsible habits that will reduce energy 
consumption in their everyday lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8069 of October 12, 2006

White Cane Safety Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation believes in the promise of all our citizens, and we must work 
to ensure that the opportunities of America are more accessible to every 
person. Many Americans who are blind or visually impaired use white 
canes to enable them to enjoy greater mobility, engage in productive 
work, and participate fully in all aspects of life. On White Cane Safety 
Day, we celebrate the many achievements of Americans who are blind or 
visually impaired, and we recognize the white cane as an important 
symbol of their determination and independence.
My Administration remains committed to removing barriers that confront 
Americans with disabilities. Since we launched the New Freedom 
Initiative 5 years ago, we have worked to improve access to community 
life, expand educational opportunities, strengthen training and 
employment services, and promote the development of technology for 
people with disabilities. We are building on the progress of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act and working to make America a place 
where all citizens have the opportunity to realize their full potential.
The Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-628) approved on 
October 6, 1964, as amended, has designated October 15 of each year as 
``White Cane Safety Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2006, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon public officials, business leaders, educators, librarians, 
and all the people of the United States to join as we work to ensure 
that the benefits and privileges of life in our great Nation are 
available to Americans who are blind or visually impaired, and to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

National Character Counts Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's strength is found in the spirit and character of our people. 
During National Character Counts Week, we renew our commitment to 
instilling values in our young people and to encouraging all Americans 
to remember the importance of good character.

[[Page 154]]

As the primary teachers and examples of character, parents help create a 
more compassionate and decent society. And as individuals, we all have 
an obligation to help our children become responsible citizens and 
realize their full potential. By demonstrating values such as integrity, 
courage, honesty, and patriotism, all Americans can help our children 
develop strength and character.
Countless individuals throughout our country demonstrate character by 
volunteering their time and energy to help neighbors in need. The men 
and women of our Armed Forces set an example of character by bravely 
putting the security of our Nation before their own lives. We also see 
character in the family members, teachers, coaches, and other dedicated 
individuals whose hearts are invested in the future of our children.
Our changing world requires virtues that sustain our democracy, make 
self-government possible, and help build a more hopeful future. National 
Character Counts Week is an opportunity to recognize the depth of 
America's character and appreciate those who pass on our values to 
future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15 through October 
21, 2006, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public 
officials, educators, librarians, parents, students, and all Americans 
to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

National Forest Products Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Forest Products Week, we take time to appreciate the 
natural splendor of our country's forests and acknowledge the importance 
of these woodlands to our economic and environmental vitality. It is 
also an opportunity to renew our commitment to conserving our natural 
resources and to using them responsibly.
Our forests are important to our economic well-being, supplying products 
that drive our economy and create jobs and opportunities.
America's forests are also an important part of our Nation's natural 
beauty, and we must continue to conserve and use these resources in a 
manner that preserves them for future generations. My Administration is 
committed to protecting our forests and woodlands against fire damage. 
Through the Healthy Forests Initiative, we have reduced the danger of 
fires by removing

[[Page 155]]

hazardous fuels from millions of acres of Federal land, making 
communities safer from catastrophic fire and improving wildlife habitat.
Recognizing the ``importance and heritage of our vast forest resources 
which are inseparably tied to our present and our future,'' the 
Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has 
designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each 
year as ``National Forest Products Week'' and has requested the 
President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15 through October 21, 2006, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 8072 of October 18, 2006

50th Anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution, we celebrate the 
Hungarians who defied an empire to demand their liberty, we recognize 
the friendship between the United States and Hungary, and we reaffirm 
our shared desire to spread freedom to people around the world.
The story of Hungarian democracy represents the triumph of liberty over 
tyranny. In the fall of 1956, the Hungarian people demanded change, and 
tens of thousands of students, workers, and other citizens bravely 
marched through the streets to call for freedom. Though Soviet tanks 
brutally crushed the Hungarian uprising, the thirst for freedom lived 
on, and in 1989 Hungary became the first communist nation in Europe to 
make the transition to democracy. The lesson of the Hungarian experience 
is clear: liberty can be delayed, but it cannot be denied. Today, this 
beautiful country has held democratic elections, established a free 
economy, and inspired millions around the world.
The United States is grateful for the warm relationship between our 
countries and for Hungary's efforts to expand freedom and democracy 
around the world in places such as the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
Cuba. By spreading the blessings of liberty, Hungary is helping to lay 
the foundation of peace for generations to come.
As we celebrate this anniversary, we also recognize the many ways 
Hungarian Americans have enriched and strengthened our country. Their 
spirit and hard work have contributed to the vitality, success, and 
prosperity of our Nation, and we continue to be inspired by their 
courage and conviction.

[[Page 156]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

Revolution. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 8073 of October 20, 2006

United Nations Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On October 24, 1945, the United Nations was formed to promote peace and 
international security, further economic and social development, protect 
fundamental human dignity, and recognize the equal rights of men and 
women. On United Nations Day, we recognize the establishment of this 
important organization and underscore our commitment to making the world 
free and secure.
The United Nations was built on the idea that nations can act together 
to resolve conflict, and in the more than six decades since it was 
formed, the United Nations has addressed significant international 
challenges. With 192 member countries, the United Nations works to 
promote freedom, expand opportunity, and reach out to those in need.
Today, as we work to combat extremism and terror with justice and 
dignity, the efforts of the United Nations are as vital as ever. The 
world needs the members of the United Nations to stand together to help 
the organization live up to its founding ideals, fulfill its mission, 
and spread hope and liberty to people around the globe. Together, we can 
combat terrorism, help empower the voices of moderation, fight disease, 
and work for a world where all people are free to determine their own 
destinies.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2006, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor 
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas 
under the flag of the United States to observe United Nations Day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of

Proclamation 8074 of October 30, 2006

National Adoption Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Adoption Month, we encourage the adoption of young 
people in need, and we honor the adoptive and foster families who have 
offered children a loving and supportive home.
The best of America is reflected in the many citizens who have adopted 
children as their own. Mothers and fathers are the most important 
influences in a child's life, and children with caring, involved parents 
can better realize the full promise of America. Parents help their 
children thrive by encouraging them to aim high, work hard, and make 
good choices that will lead to healthy, satisfying lives. On November 
18, loving families across America will celebrate National Adoption Day 
by finalizing their adoptions of children from foster care. This day 
will also raise awareness of the many children still waiting to be 
adopted and encourage more Americans to choose adoption.
My Administration is committed to helping place children with caring 
families. Through the Collaboration to AdoptUsKids project at 
adoptuskids.org, we are working to provide guidance and support for 
parents considering adoption. We are also offering tax credits to ease 
the financial burden on adoptive families, and we are providing funding 
to help strengthen State adoption services through the Adoption 
Incentives Program and the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program. 
Together, these efforts can help connect children with loving families 
and help provide greater hope and opportunity for America's children.
During National Adoption Month, we pay tribute to the parents who have 
opened their hearts and homes and helped provide love and stability for 
young people. By caring for the youngest members of our society, these 
families are helping our children grow into successful adults and 
building the future of our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2006 as National 
Adoption Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities to honor adoptive families and to 
participate in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we renew our 
resolve in the fight against this devastating disease, and we take time 
to remember the loved ones taken from us by Alzheimer's. We also 
recognize the patients and family members who are affected by it, and we 
extend our gratitude to the caretakers and researchers who are pursuing 
better treatments and a cure.
Age is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, so the need for 
prevention, improved treatments, and a cure becomes increasingly urgent 
as more Americans grow older. My Administration is pursuing the 
tremendous possibilities that science offers to improve the lives of the 
millions suffering from this disease. We continue to support Alzheimer's 
disease research through the National Institutes of Health and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. New progress is being made as more is 
learned about this disease.
America is blessed by our seniors, and they have earned our greatest 
respect. Citizens living with Alzheimer's disease deserve the best 
possible care. National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month is an 
opportunity for Americans to offer our support to Alzheimer's patients 
and those who sacrifice to help them live with dignity and comfort. The 
strength and compassion of these individuals reflect the good heart of 
the American people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2006 as National 
Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the

Proclamation 8076 of October 30, 2006

National American Indian Heritage Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National American Indian Heritage Month, we honor the generations 
of American Indians and Alaska Natives who have added to the character 
of our Nation. This month is an opportunity to celebrate their many 
accomplishments and their rich ancestry and traditions.

[[Page 159]]

America is blessed by the character and strength of American Indians and 
Alaska Natives, and our citizens are grateful for the countless ways 
Native Americans have enriched our country and lifted the spirit of our 
Nation. We are especially grateful for the Native Americans who have 
served and continue to serve in our Nation's military. These brave 
individuals have risked their lives to protect our citizens, defend our 
democracy, and spread the blessings of liberty to people around the 
world.
My Administration is working to ensure that American Indians and Alaska 
Natives have access to all the opportunities of this great land. My 
fiscal year 2007 budget proposes more than $12.7 billion for government 
programs for Native Americans. Education is vital to ensuring all 
citizens reach their full potential, and my budget includes funding to 
help Native-American schools succeed and meet the requirements of the No 
Child Left Behind Act. The Bureau of Indian Affairs is providing 
education for approximately 46,000 American-Indian and Alaska-Native 
children. To help keep Native Americans safe, I have also proposed to 
increase law enforcement personnel and improve law enforcement 
facilities in American-Indian communities. My Administration will 
continue to work on a government-to-government basis with tribal 
governments, honor the principles of tribal sovereignty and the right to 
self-determination, and help ensure America remains a land of promise 
for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and all our citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2006 as National 
American Indian Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate 
this month with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8077 of October 30, 2006

National Diabetes Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Diabetes Month is an opportunity to raise awareness of risk 
factors, prevention, and treatment of this serious disease.
Diabetes is a chronic illness affecting nearly 21 million Americans of 
all ages and backgrounds. It can cause blindness, nontraumatic 
amputations, kidney disease, and increased risk of heart disease and 
stroke. Though diabetes affects Americans of all racial and ethnic 
backgrounds, certain groups are at higher risk, including Hispanic, 
Asian/Pacific, African, and Native Americans. A small percentage of 
people with the disease suffer from Type 1 diabetes, once known as 
juvenile diabetes. These individuals are usually children or young 
adults whose bodies are unable to make insulin. Type

[[Page 160]]

2 diabetes is more common and frequently occurs in individuals who have 
a family history of the disease and in people who are obese, inactive, 
or older. This form of diabetes stops a person's body from using insulin 
properly. By maintaining healthy eating habits and exercising daily, 
Americans can help prevent and reduce the effects of diabetes. 
Individuals should consult with their doctors and receive a preventive 
screening to help detect diabetes in its earliest stages.
My Administration has demonstrated a strong commitment to preventing and 
finding a cure for diabetes. We have supported funding for diabetes 
education programs and research initiatives, and this year the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that more than $1 billion will be 
spent on diabetes research. The NIH and the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention are sponsoring the National Diabetes Education Program, 
which has helped inform millions of Americans about the risk factors of 
diabetes and the benefits of making healthy choices. By working together 
we can continue to make significant strides in the battle to beat this 
disease and provide a brighter future for many of our citizens.
As we observe National Diabetes Month, we recognize the medical 
professionals, researchers, and all those whose tireless efforts are 
making a positive difference in the lives of Americans suffering from 
this disease. This month we reaffirm our commitment to fighting 
diabetes, and through medical advances, preventive programs, and quality 
health care, we will help diabetes patients live longer, healthier, and 
happier lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2006 as National 
Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the risk 
factors and symptoms associated with diabetes and to observe this month 
with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

National Family Caregivers Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our country is blessed to have millions of compassionate citizens who 
bring love and support to family members and friends who are chronically 
ill, elderly, or disabled. During National Family Caregivers Month, we 
recognize these kind individuals who give of their hearts, resources, 
and energy to assist loved ones in need.
Family caregivers exemplify the true spirit of compassion by providing 
support to their loved ones and assisting with their everyday activities 
and

[[Page 161]]

special needs. These selfless people must often make great personal 
sacrifices to maintain the care and support their family and friends 
require. Their assistance provides those who may be ill, aging, or 
disabled an opportunity to stay in familiar surroundings and remain a 
part of their community.
My Administration is committed to supporting family caregivers and their 
vital role in our Nation's communities. The National Family Caregiver 
Support Program continues to provide information, counseling, and 
services and encourages cooperation among agencies and other providers 
that work with caregivers. These efforts assist caregivers and help 
ensure that all Americans receive the care they need.
As we observe National Family Caregivers Month, we honor family 
caregivers who take time out of their lives to improve the lives of 
family and friends. Their efforts demonstrate the best of the American 
spirit.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2006 as National 
Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to honor the selfless 
service of caregivers who support their loved ones in need.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8079 of October 30, 2006

National Hospice Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans demonstrate the great compassion of our country by caring for 
those in need. During National Hospice Month, we recognize hospice 
caregivers for their dedication to providing comfort and peace to 
individuals in their last days and helping build a society that values 
the life and dignity of every person.
Hospice physicians, nurses, counselors, and volunteers bring care and 
support to the terminally ill through physical, psychological, social, 
and spiritual aid. By helping control pain and minimize other symptoms, 
these men and women bring relief to those who are terminally ill and 
show them the utmost respect. Hospice care enables many of our citizens 
to spend their final days in comfort and dignity surrounded by loved 
ones. This palliative care plays a vital role in our Nation's health 
care system, and the dedicated work of hospice caregivers helps ensure 
that our citizens receive the services and support they need. Hospice 
caregivers also reach out to families and friends to provide guidance 
and counseling after the loss of a loved one.

[[Page 162]]

Our Nation is grateful for the tireless efforts of hospice volunteers 
and medical professionals, and during National Hospice Month, we 
recognize the kindness of hospice caregivers and their devotion to 
making our country a more loving and caring place.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2006 as National 
Hospice Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities. I also ask Americans to recognize 
our health care professionals and volunteers for their contributions to 
helping provide comfort and care to those facing terminal illness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the

Veterans Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Through the generations, America's men and women in uniform have 
defeated tyrants, liberated continents, and set a standard of courage 
and idealism for the entire world. On Veterans Day, our Nation pays 
tribute to those who have proudly served in our Armed Forces.
To protect the Nation they love, our veterans stepped forward when 
America needed them most. In conflicts around the world, their sacrifice 
and resolve helped destroy the enemies of freedom and saved millions 
from oppression. In answering history's call with honor, decency, and 
resolve, our veterans have shown the power of liberty and earned the 
respect and admiration of a grateful Nation.
All of America's veterans have placed our Nation's security before their 
own lives, creating a debt that we can never fully repay. Our veterans 
represent the best of America, and they deserve the best America can 
give them.
As we recall the service of our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and 
Coast Guardsmen, we are reminded that the defense of freedom comes with 
great loss and sacrifice. This Veterans Day, we give thanks to those who 
have served freedom's cause; we salute the members of our Armed Forces 
who are confronting our adversaries abroad; and we honor the men and 
women who left America's shores but did not live to be thanked as 
veterans. They will always be remembered by our country.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service men 
and women have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor veterans.

[[Page 163]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2006, as Veterans Day and urge 
all Americans to observe November 5 through November 11, 2006, as 
National Veterans Awareness Week. I encourage all Americans to recognize 
the valor and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers. 
I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of 
the United States and to support and participate in patriotic activities 
in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places 
of worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this 
national observance with commemorative expressions and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the

Proclamation 8081 of November 2, 2006

World Freedom Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall was torn down by the desire of a 
people to be free. On World Freedom Day, we commemorate this historic 
event and reflect on liberty's power to change lives and raise 
societies.
After decades of oppression, the fall of the Berlin Wall brought the 
light of liberty to the people of East Berlin, and the events that 
followed set the course for a new era of freedom in Germany and in much 
of Central and Eastern Europe. Today, we again face an ideological 
struggle with the enemies of freedom, democracy, and moderation. In this 
struggle, America will continue to stand with those who seek to build 
societies where people live in freedom and at peace with each other and 
the world.
The collapse of the Berlin Wall demonstrated that when liberty 
flourishes, nations become more tolerant, hopeful, and secure. On World 
Freedom Day, we celebrate the power of freedom and democracy. We are 
also reminded that free countries have the responsibility to work 
together to protect the fundamental rights of all people and help others 
realize the blessings of liberty.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2006, as World 
Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our 
dedication to freedom and democracy.

Proclamation 8082 of November 8, 2006

National Farm-City Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, America's farmers and ranchers have demonstrated 
the values of determination, faith, love of family, and patriotism. The 
contributions of America's farmers and ranchers help keep our economy 
moving forward, and during National Farm-City Week we underscore the 
vital partnership between America's rural and urban industries.
By providing raw materials, energy, and a safe and healthy food supply, 
our farmers and ranchers help enrich our lives and create economic 
opportunities across our Nation. As good stewards of the land, they help 
preserve the farming industry and way of life for future generations.
Farmers are playing an increasingly important role in reducing our 
dependence on foreign oil by growing crops such as soybeans and corn 
that can be used as alternative sources of energy. Our agricultural 
sector also cooperates with shippers, processors, marketers, 
transporters, and others to make these vital goods available to the 
public. My Administration is committed to helping these dedicated 
individuals succeed, and we must continue investing in agricultural 
research programs, working to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, 
and opening up markets for American products overseas.
During National Farm-City Week, and throughout the year, we honor the 
farmers, ranchers, and all those working to build strong relationships 
between our rural and urban communities. Our economy is strong and 
growing, and behind the numbers are the stories of hard-working 
Americans who help spur our economic prosperity and feed our country and 
the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 17 through 
November 23, 2006, as National Farm-City Week. I encourage all Americans 
to join in recognizing farmers, ranchers, and other professionals who 
work to produce our agricultural abundance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the

America Recycles Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Good stewardship of the environment is a personal responsibility and an 
important public value, and on America Recycles Day, we highlight the 
many benefits of recycling. By taking steps to reduce waste and re-use 
materials, we can save precious natural resources, enhance the beauty of 
our communities, and add to the health and prosperity of our Nation.
Our citizens play an important role in protecting our environment, and 
throughout our country, we are recycling, composting, and helping turn 
materials that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources. 
Recycling helps conserve energy, prevent greenhouse gas emissions and 
water pollutants, and decrease the need for new landfills and 
incinerators.
Recognizing the importance of recycling, my Administration is promoting 
cooperative efforts to conserve and maintain our natural resources. The 
Environmental Protection Agency is encouraging businesses, industries, 
and communities to work together to promote recycling through the 
Resource Conservation Challenge (RCC). Partnerships between government 
agencies, businesses, industries, and private organizations help us to 
improve practices of recycling, re-use, and waste reduction. In 
addition, my Administration is working with businesses through the Plug-
In To eCycling Campaign to collect and re-use computers, cell phones, 
and other electronics that would otherwise become solid or hazardous 
waste. To further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save energy, the 
EPA is also partnering with manufacturers, utility companies, and 
construction companies through the Industrial Materials Recycling effort 
to increase the safe re-use of industrial byproducts.
Americans are united in the belief that we have an obligation to be good 
stewards of the environment, and America Recycles Day is an opportunity 
to recommit ourselves to wisely managing our natural resources. By 
promoting responsibility and good citizenship, we can build a brighter 
future for our children and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2006, as 
America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 8084 of November 16, 2006

National Family Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Families are indispensable to a stable and free society. They pass along 
the traditions and principles that help make America compassionate, 
decent, and hopeful. During National Family Week, we honor our families 
and recognize their contributions to keeping our country strong.
Today's fast-changing world needs the anchor of values and virtues that 
families can provide. Strong families instill responsibility and 
character in our children and teach them the ideals that make us a great 
Nation. Through their love and sacrifice, America's parents, 
grandparents, aunts, uncles, siblings, and other family members help 
prepare our young people to realize the bright future America offers 
each child.
My Administration is committed to ensuring that our children grow up in 
loving, stable homes. Earlier this year, I signed legislation that 
creates new grants for faith-based and community organizations to 
support healthy marriages and responsible fatherhood. By reducing the 
marriage penalty and doubling the child tax credit, we have also 
provided important tax relief that helps parents to support and provide 
for their families.
During National Family Week and throughout the year, we also extend our 
appreciation and support to our courageous military families, who have 
borne the hardships of war with dignity and devotion. Our Nation has 
remained strong and free because the brave men and women of our Armed 
Forces defend this country and our beliefs. By supporting their loved 
ones in uniform, our military families are also serving our country, and 
America is grateful for their service and sacrifice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 19 through 
November 25, 2006, as National Family Week. I invite the States, 
communities, and all the people of the United States to join together in 
observing this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor 
our Nation's families.

Proclamation 8085 of November 16, 2006

Thanksgiving Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans gather with family and friends to celebrate Thanksgiving 
Day, we give thanks for the many ways that our Nation and our people 
have been blessed.
The Thanksgiving tradition dates back to the earliest days of our 
society, celebrated in decisive moments in our history and in quiet 
times around family tables. Nearly four centuries have passed since 
early settlers gave thanks for their safe arrival and pilgrims enjoyed a 
harvest feast to thank God for allowing them to survive a harsh winter 
in the New World. General George Washington observed Thanksgiving during 
the Revolutionary War, and in his first proclamation after becoming 
President, he declared November 26, 1789, a national day of 
``thanksgiving and prayer.'' During the Civil War, President Abraham 
Lincoln revived the tradition of proclaiming a day of thanksgiving, 
reminding a divided Nation of its founding ideals.
At this time of great promise for America, we are grateful for the 
freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and defended by our Armed Forces 
throughout the generations. Today, many of these courageous men and 
women are securing our peace in places far from home, and we pay tribute 
to them and to their families for their service, sacrifice, and 
strength. We also honor the families of the fallen and lift them up in 
our prayers.
Our citizens are privileged to live in the world's freest country, where 
the hope of the American dream is within the reach of every person. 
Americans share a desire to answer the universal call to serve something 
greater than ourselves, and we see this spirit every day in the millions 
of volunteers throughout our country who bring hope and healing to those 
in need. On this Thanksgiving Day, and throughout the year, let us show 
our gratitude for the blessings of freedom, family, and faith, and may 
God continue to bless America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 23, 
2006, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all Americans to 
gather together in their homes and places of worship with family, 
friends, and loved ones to reinforce the ties that bind us and give 
thanks for the freedoms and many blessings we enjoy.

Proclamation 8086 of November 27, 2006

National Methamphetamine Awareness Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Methamphetamine abuse shatters families and threatens our communities. 
On National Methamphetamine Awareness Day, we underscore the dangers of 
methamphetamine and reaffirm our collective responsibility to combat all 
forms of drug abuse.
Methamphetamine is a powerfully addictive drug that dramatically affects 
users' minds and bodies. Chronic use can lead to violent behavior, 
paranoia, and an inability to cope with the ordinary demands of life. 
Methamphetamine abusers can transform homes into places of danger and 
despair by neglecting or endangering the lives of their children, 
spouses, and other loved ones. Additionally, methamphetamine production 
exposes anyone near the process to toxic chemicals and the risk of 
explosion.
My Administration is committed to fighting the spread of methamphetamine 
abuse throughout our country. While the number of teens who have tried 
this deadly drug and the number of people testing positive for 
methamphetamine in the workplace have decreased in recent years, 
methamphetamine use is still a dangerous public health problem. In the 
Synthetic Drug Control Strategy released earlier this year, my 
Administration set goals of a 15 percent decrease in methamphetamine use 
and 25 percent reduction in domestic methamphetamine labs over the next 
3 years. To help reach these objectives, my proposed 2007 budget 
includes $25 million to help ensure that Americans have access to 
effective methamphetamine abuse recovery services and programs. Earlier 
this year, I also signed into law the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic 
Act of 2005, which makes manufacturing the drug more difficult and 
imposes tougher penalties on those who smuggle or sell it.
The struggle against methamphetamine is a national, State, and local 
effort. To find out how to raise awareness and to learn more about the 
battle against methamphetamine abuse, concerned citizens may visit 
theantidrug.com and methresources.gov. By working together, we can build 
a stronger, healthier America for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 30, 2006, as 
National Methamphetamine Awareness Day. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this day with appropriate programs and 
activities.

World AIDS Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

HIV/AIDS is a global health crisis and a constant struggle for many of 
our families, friends, and neighbors. On World AIDS Day, we underscore 
our commitment to fight the AIDS pandemic with compassion and decisive 
action.
America leads the world in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and through the 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief we are combating the disease in countries 
around the world. Through the New Partners Initiative, we are supporting 
faith-based and community organizations that offer much of the health 
care in the developing world, so that we can reach more people more 
effectively. In addition, the United States and other concerned 
countries are promoting a comprehensive strategy to prevent the spread 
of HIV/AIDS. This includes the ABC approach--encouraging abstinence, 
being faithful, and using condoms, with abstinence as the only sure way 
to avoid the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS.
As we work to fight HIV/AIDS globally, we must also ensure our citizens 
at home have the resources and support they need for treatment and 
prevention of this disease. Today, more than 1 million Americans are 
living with HIV/AIDS, and many of these individuals are unaware that 
they are infected. We will continue to provide medical care, counseling, 
and testing for those in greatest need of HIV/AIDS assistance, and I 
have asked the Congress to reform and reauthorize the Ryan White CARE 
Act and provide new funding to improve distribution of HIV/AIDS 
medicines in America. The Federal Government is also working closely 
with faith-based and other community organizations to provide services 
to individuals with HIV/AIDS and end the stigma of AIDS.
America is blessed with scientific knowledge and compassionate citizens, 
and we are guided by our founding conviction that each life has 
matchless value. On World AIDS Day and throughout the year, we stand 
with our friends and partners around the world in the urgent struggle to 
fight this virus, comfort those who are affected, and save lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2006, as World 
AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to 
AIDS, to work to prevent this deadly disease, and to comfort and support 
those living with HIV/AIDS.

Proclamation 8088 of December 1, 2006

National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, thousands of Americans lose their lives in accidents 
involving drunk and drugged driving. During National Drunk and Drugged 
Driving Prevention Month, we continue our efforts to promote awareness 
of the dangers of impaired driving and encourage fellow citizens to 
never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
All Americans can play an important role in preventing drunk and drugged 
driving. Family members can discuss the dangers of impaired driving; 
businesses, schools, and organizations in our communities can help 
spread the message of awareness; and individuals can help protect family 
and friends by identifying a designated driver. During the holiday 
season, it is especially important to encourage responsible driving and 
to help ensure the safety of friends and loved ones.
My Administration is committed to saving lives by stopping drunk and 
drugged drivers before they put themselves and others at risk. We 
continue to work with communities across our Nation to increase public 
awareness and prevention of this serious offense. The Department of 
Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has 
partnered with State and local law enforcement agencies to carry out the 
campaign, ``Drunk Driving. Over the Limit. Under Arrest.'' This program 
aims to keep impaired drivers off our Nation's roads by creating new 
public education programs and toughening enforcement. The Office of 
National Drug Control Policy works to warn young drivers and their 
parents about the dangers of driving under the influence of drugs. My 
Administration is also supporting community and faith-based programs 
that encourage others to avoid the devastating consequences of impaired 
driving.
Every person has a responsibility to drive free of alcohol and drugs and 
to insist that friends and family do the same. By helping fight drunk 
and drugged driving, Americans everywhere can save lives and send a 
strong message that driving under the influence is not acceptable.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2006 as National 
Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. I encourage all Americans to 
make responsible decisions and to help prevent drunk and drugged 
driving.

Proclamation 8089 of December 1, 2006

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty-five years ago, more than 2,400 Americans lost their lives in a 
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance 
Day, we think of those who died on December 7, 1941, and honor all those 
who sacrificed for our liberty during World War II.
On that peaceful Sunday morning, our country suffered a vicious, 
unprovoked attack that changed the course of history. Though our Pacific 
Fleet was nearly destroyed, our citizens were inspired by the great acts 
of heroism from those who survived and from those who did not. In the 
days that followed, our grief turned to resolution, and America embarked 
on a mission to defeat two of the most ruthless regimes the world has 
ever known. We pledge to always remember the character and sacrifice of 
the brave individuals at Pearl Harbor. Their selfless service helped 
deliver a great victory for the cause of freedom and, ultimately, 
transformed adversaries into the closest of friends.
After the devastating attacks on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt declared, ``We are going to win the war and we are going to 
win the peace that follows.'' In the 21st century, freedom is again 
under attack, and young Americans have stepped forward to serve in a 
global war on terror that will secure our liberty and determine the 
destiny of millions around the world. Like generations before, we will 
answer history's call with confidence, confront threats to our way of 
life, and build a more peaceful world for our children and 
grandchildren.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2006, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn 
occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal 
agencies, interested organizations, groups, and individuals to fly the 
flag of the United States at half-staff this December 7 in honor of 
those who died as a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8090 of December 8, 2006

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Peace and justice prevail when people are free to speak, assemble, and 
worship, when their rights are protected, and when governments are 
accountable to their citizens. These blessings of freedom are guaranteed 
for Americans in the Bill of Rights of our Constitution. During Human 
Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, we celebrate the 
ideals of our founders and reaffirm the belief that freedom is the gift 
of God and the right of all mankind.
Just over six decades ago, the future of freedom seemed bleak, with only 
a small number of democracies around the world. Today, citizens of over 
100 nations enjoy the blessings of democracy, and freedom is taking root 
in places where liberty had been unimaginable. The United States will 
continue to support the growth of democratic movements and institutions 
in every nation.
The advance of freedom is the story of our time, and new chapters are 
being written before our eyes. Around the world, freedom is replacing 
tyranny and giving men and women the opportunity to enjoy lives of 
purpose and dignity. Because Americans are committed to the God-given 
value of every life, we cherish the freedom of every person in every 
nation and strive to promote respect for human rights. By standing with 
those who desire liberty, we will help extend freedom to many who have 
not known it and lay the foundations of peace for generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2006, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 2006, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 2006, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to mark these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.

December, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-

Proclamation 8091 of December 15, 2006

Wright Brothers Day, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America has a rich history of exploration and discovery, marked by 
scientific and technological achievements that have transformed the 
world. On Wright Brothers Day, we remember two aviation pioneers from 
Ohio whose big dreams and extraordinary accomplishments helped change 
the course of human history.
On December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright completed the first 
manned, powered flight in history and ushered all of mankind into a new 
era of possibility and promise. With Orville at the controls, the Wright 
brothers' small aircraft traveled 120 feet in 12 seconds above the dunes 
of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The age of flight had begun, and in the 
decades that followed, advancements in aviation would enable determined 
American risk-takers to cross oceans, break the sound barrier, and walk 
on the Moon.
Today, our Nation follows the Wright brothers' example of innovation as 
we continue to explore the frontiers of air and space. My Administration 
has outlined a vision for space exploration that includes a return to 
the Moon and a long-term human and robotic program to explore Mars and 
the solar system. By working to expand the realm of the possible, we can 
gain a better understanding of the universe and continue the journey 
that the Wright brothers began more than a century ago.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as 
amended (77 Stat. 402; 36 U.S.C. 143), has designated December 17 of 
each year as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested 
the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of 
the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2006, as Wright Brothers Day.

[[Page 174]]

December, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8092 of December 22, 2006

National Mentoring Month, 2007

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Mentoring Month, we honor the caring individuals across 
our Nation who are committed to helping the next generation of Americans 
reach their full potential.
Mentors help teach important skills that are necessary for a healthy, 
successful life and help shape the character of our young people. They 
instill compassion and responsibility in our children and help motivate 
them to do their best in school. By providing leadership and guidance, 
mentors can inspire young people to set high goals and help them achieve 
a bright future.
My Administration is committed to helping the next generation realize 
the promise of our Nation. Through the USA Freedom Corps, we are 
providing opportunities for mentors to connect with children in schools, 
after-school programs, and community groups. The Helping America's Youth 
initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, raises awareness about the 
challenges facing our youth and encourages adults to connect with youth 
in three key areas: family, school, and community. The initiative also 
supports community partnerships that develop opportunities for mentoring 
and positive youth development.
I appreciate the contributions of all those who serve as mentors, and I 
encourage all Americans to get involved in mentoring programs. To learn 
about mentoring opportunities, citizens can visit the USA Freedom Corps 
website at volunteer.gov. By joining teachers, coaches, religious 
leaders, relatives, and other mentors, individuals can use their talents 
and experiences to enrich the lives of young people and demonstrate the 
compassionate spirit of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2007 as National 
Mentoring Month. I call upon the people of the United States to 
recognize the importance of mentoring, to look for opportunities to 
serve as mentors in their communities, and to observe this month with 
appropriate activities and programs.

Proclamation 8093 of December 27, 2006

Announcing the Death of Gerald R. Ford

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:
It is my sad duty to announce officially the death of Gerald R. Ford, 
the thirty-eighth President of the United States, on December 26, 2006.
President Ford was a great man who devoted the best years of his life to 
serving the United States of America. He was also a true gentleman who 
reflected the best in America's character. Before the world knew his 
name, he served with distinction in the United States Navy and the 
United States House of Representatives. As a congressman from Michigan, 
and then as Vice President, he commanded the respect and earned the 
goodwill of all who had the privilege of knowing him. On August 9, 1974, 
he stepped into the presidency without having ever sought the office.
During his time in office, the American people came to know President 
Ford as a man of complete integrity, who led our country with common 
sense and kind instincts. Americans will always admire Gerald Ford's 
unflinching performance of duty, the honorable conduct of his 
Administration, and the great rectitude of the man himself. We mourn the 
loss of such a leader, and our thirty-eighth President will always have 
a special place in our Nation's memory.
President Ford lived 93 years, and his life was a blessing to America. 
Now this fine man will be taken to his rest by a family that will love 
him always and by a Nation that will be grateful to him forever.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, in honor and tribute to the memory of Gerald R. Ford, 
and as an expression of public sorrow, do hereby direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed at half-staff at the White House and on 
all buildings, grounds, and Naval vessels of the United States for a 
period of 30 days from the day of his death. I also direct that for the 
same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign 
countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at 
half-staff over their Embassies, Legations, and other facilities abroad, 
including all military facilities and stations.
I hereby order that suitable honors be rendered by units of the Armed 
Forces under orders of the Secretary of Defense.
In a further expression of our national grief, I will appoint in a 
subsequent proclamation a National Day of Mourning throughout the United 
States

[[Page 176]]

when the American people may assemble in their respective places of 
worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President Ford.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day 
of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

thirty-eighth President of the United States,
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, in honor and tribute to the memory of Gerald R. Ford, 
and as an expression of public sorrow, do appoint Tuesday, January 2, 
2007, as a National Day of Mourning throughout the United States. I call 
on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective 
places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President Ford. 
I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this 
solemn observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of December in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.

Proclamation 8095 of December 29, 2006

To Eliminate Tariffs on Certain Pharmaceuticals and Chemical 
Intermediates

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. During the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations (the 
``Uruguay Round''), a group of major trading countries agreed to 
reciprocal elimination of tariffs on certain pharmaceuticals and 
chemical intermediates, and that participants in this agreement would 
revise periodically the list of products subject to duty-free treatment. 
On December 13, 1996, at the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), the United States and 16 other major trading 
countries agreed to eliminate tariffs on additional pharmaceuticals and 
chemical intermediates. On April 1, 1997, the United States implemented 
this agreement in Proclamation 6982.

[[Page 177]]

The second revision to the list of products was negotiated under the 
auspices of the WTO in 1998. The United States implemented this revision 
on July 1, 1999, in Proclamation 7207. In 2006, the United States and 30 
other WTO members concluded negotiations, under the auspices of the WTO, 
on a further revision to the list of pharmaceuticals and chemical 
intermediates to receive duty-free treatment.
2. Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA)(19 U.S.C. 
3521(b)) authorizes the President under specified circumstances to 
proclaim the modification of any duty or staged rate reduction of any 
duty set forth in Schedule XX-United States of America, annexed to the 
Marrakesh Protocol to the GATT 1994 (Schedule XX) for products that were 
the subject of reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the 
Uruguay Round, if the United States agrees to such action in a 
multilateral negotiation under the auspices of the WTO. Section 111(b) 
also authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications as are 
necessary to correct technical errors in, or make other rectifications 
to, Schedule XX.
3. On October 3, 2006, consistent with section 115 of the URAA, the 
United States Trade Representative (USTR) submitted a report to the 
Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Finance of the Senate (the ``Committees'') that set forth 
the proposed further revision to the list of products subject to tariff 
eliminations.
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and 
of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, 
including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any 
rate of duty or other import restriction.
5. Pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined that 
Schedule XX should be modified to reflect the implementation by the 
United States of the multilateral agreement on certain pharmaceuticals 
and chemical intermediates negotiated under the auspices of the WTO. In 
addition, I have determined that the pharmaceuticals appendix to the HTS 
should be modified to reflect the duty eliminations provided for in that 
agreement and to make certain technical corrections in the manner in 
which Schedule XX identifies particular products in order to ensure that 
they are accorded the intended duty treatment.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 111(b) of the URAA and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim 
that:
(1) In order to implement the multilateral agreement negotiated under 
the auspices of the WTO to eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceutical 
products and chemical intermediates, and to make technical corrections 
in the tariff treatment accorded to such products, the HTS is modified 
as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.
(2) Such modifications to the HTS shall be effective with respect to 
articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after the date set forth in the Annex for the respective actions taken.

[[Page 178]]

(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006

To Modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, To Adjust 
Rules of Origin Under the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement 
and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 
(the ``1988 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States 
International Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') to keep the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous 
review and periodically to recommend to the President such modifications 
to the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to 
accomplish the purposes

[[Page 200]]

set forth in that subsection. The Commission has recommended 
modifications to the HTS pursuant to sections 1205(c) and (d) of the 
1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(c) and (d)) to conform the HTS to amendments 
made to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity 
Description and Coding System (the ``Convention'').
2. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the 
President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the 
recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act, if 
he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United 
States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the 
national economic interest of the United States. I have determined that 
the modifications to the HTS proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to 
section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) are in conformity 
with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run 
counter to the national economic interest of the United States.
3. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (the ``NAFTA'') with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``NAFTA Implementation Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 3331), the staged reductions in rates of duty that the 
President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out 
articles 302, 305, 307, 308, and 703 and Annexes 302.2, 307.1, 308.1, 
308.2, 300-B, 703.2, and 703.3 of the NAFTA. In order to ensure the 
continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating 
goods of Mexico under tariff categories that are being modified to 
reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that 
additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to 
carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.
4. Presidential Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented with 
respect to the United States the trade agreements resulting from the 
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including Schedule XX-
United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Schedule XX), that were 
entered into pursuant to sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)) and approved in section 101(a) of the Uruguay 
Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3511(a)).
5. Pursuant to the authority provided in section 111 of the URAA (19 
U.S.C. 3521) and sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act, Proclamation 
6763 included the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President 
determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of 
Schedule XX. In order to ensure the continuation of such rates of duty 
for imported goods under tariff categories that are being modified to 
reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that 
additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to 
carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed, including certain 
technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.
6. Presidential Proclamation 7351 of October 2, 2000, implemented 
section 211 of the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act 
(CBTPA) (title II of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 286) in order to 
provide certain preferential tariff treatment to eligible articles that 
are the product of any country that the President designates as a 
``CBTPA beneficiary country''

[[Page 201]]

and that the President determines to have satisfied the requirements of 
section 213(b)(4)(A)(ii) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act 
(CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(4)(A)(ii)). Section 213(b)(3) of the CBERA 
(19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(3)) provides that the tariff treatment accorded at 
any time under the CBTPA to any article referred to in section 
213(b)(1)(B) through (F) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(1)(B) through 
(F)) that is a CBTPA originating good shall be identical to the tariff 
treatment that is accorded at such time under Annex 302.2 of the NAFTA 
to an article described in the same 8-digit subheading of the HTS that 
is a good of Mexico and is imported into the United States.
7. Pursuant to section 213(b) of the CBERA, Proclamation 7351 included 
the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President determined to 
be necessary or appropriate to provide such identical tariff treatment 
to CBTPA originating goods. In order to ensure the continuation of the 
rates of duty for imported goods under tariff categories that are being 
modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined 
that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to 
carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.
8. Presidential Proclamation 7512 of December 7, 2001, implemented the 
Agreement Between the United States of America and the Hashemite Kingdom 
of Jordan on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area (JFTA), with respect 
to the United States and, pursuant to section 101 of the United States-
Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act (the ``JFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
2112 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to 
be necessary or appropriate to carry out the concessions set forth in 
Annex 2.1 to the JFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such 
staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff 
categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the 
Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS 
are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously 
proclaimed.
9. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to 
the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-
Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USSFTA Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I 
determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 
2.2, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.12 of the USSFTA and the schedule of reductions 
with respect to the Republic of Singapore set forth in Annex 2B of the 
USSFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in 
rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are 
being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have 
determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or 
appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.
10. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the 
United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA) with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Chile 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``CFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to 
be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3 
(including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to 
originating goods set forth in Annex 3.3 to the USCFTA), 3.7, 3.9, and 
3.20(8), (9), (10), and (11)

[[Page 202]]

of the USCFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged 
reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff 
categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the 
Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS 
are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously 
proclaimed.
11. Presidential Proclamation 7857 of December 20, 2004, implemented the 
United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement (USAFTA) with respect to 
the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-
Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USAFTA Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I 
determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 
2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 of the USAFTA and the schedule of reductions with 
respect to Australia set forth in Annex 2B of the USAFTA.
12. Because the substance of the changes to the Convention will be 
reflected in slightly differing form in the national tariff schedules of 
the parties to the USAFTA, the rules of origin set out in Annexes 4A and 
5A of that Agreement must be changed to ensure that the tariff and 
certain other treatment accorded under the USAFTA to originating goods 
will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that are being 
modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention. The USAFTA parties 
have agreed to make these changes.
13. Section 203 of the USAFTA Act provides certain rules for determining 
whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing 
tariff treatment under the USAFTA. Section 203(o) of the USAFTA Act 
authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the 
USAFTA and any subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the 
USAFTA.
14. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed in 
this proclamation pursuant to sections 201 and 203 of the USAFTA Act are 
necessary or appropriate to ensure that the tariff and certain other 
treatment accorded under the USAFTA will continue to be given to 
originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to 
reflect the amendments to the Convention and to carry out the duty 
reductions previously proclaimed.
15. Presidential Proclamation 7971 of December 22, 2005, implemented the 
United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (USMFTA) with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Morocco 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USMFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to 
be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, 
2.6, 4.1, 4.3.9, 4.3.10, 4.3.11, 4.3.13, 4.3.14, and 4.3.15 of the 
USMFTA and the schedule of reductions with respect to Morocco set forth 
in Annex IV of the USMFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such 
staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff 
categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the 
Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS 
are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously 
proclaimed.
16. Presidential Proclamations 7987 of February 28, 2006, 7991 of March 
24, 2006, 7996 of March 31, 2006, and 8034 of June 30, 2006, implemented

[[Page 203]]

the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade 
Agreement (CAFTA-DR Agreement) with respect to the United States and, 
pursuant to section 201 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United 
States Implementation Act (the ``CAFTA-DR Act'') (19 U.S.C. 4031), the 
staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or 
appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.21, 3.26, 
3.27, and 3.28, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of the United 
States duty reductions with respect to originating goods), 3.27, and 
3.28. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in 
rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are 
being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have 
determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or 
appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.
17. Presidential Proclamation 8039 of July 27, 2006, implemented the 
United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (USBFTA) with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Bahrain 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USBFTA Act'') (19 U.S.C. 
3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to 
be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, 
2.6, 3.2.8, and 3.2.9, and the schedule of reductions with respect to 
Bahrain set forth in Annex 2-B of the USBFTA. In order to ensure the 
continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating 
goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the 
amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional 
modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the 
duty reductions previously proclaimed.
18. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts, affecting 
import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, 
modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other 
import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 
U.S.C. 3006(c)), provides that any modifications proclaimed by the 
President under section 1206(a) of that Act may not take effect before 
the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation 
is published in the Federal Register.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
sections 1102 and 1206 of the 1988 Act, section 214 of the CBERA,

Proclamation 8098 of December 29, 2006

To Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act and 
the Generalized System of Preferences

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 
Act'')(19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200)(AGOA), 
authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of 
the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country'' if the President determines that the country meets the 
eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 
3703), as well as the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).
2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an ``eligible sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.
3. Section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(B)) provides 
special rules for certain apparel articles imported from ``lesser 
developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.''
4. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 
1974 Act, I have determined that the Republic of Liberia (Liberia) meets 
the eligibility requirements set forth or referenced therein, and I have 
decided to designate Liberia as an eligible sub-Saharan African country 
and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
5. I further determine that Liberia satisfies the criterion for 
treatment as a ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country'' under section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA.
6. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461, 
2462(a)), the President is authorized to designate countries as 
beneficiary developing countries and to designate any beneficiary 
developing country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country, 
for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.
7. Section 502(b)(1)(C) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(1)(C)) 
specifies that European Union Member States may not be designated as 
beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP.
8. Section 507(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)) provides that in 
the case of an association of countries that is a free trade area or 
customs union, or that is contributing to a comprehensive regional 
economic integration among its members through appropriate means, the 
President may

[[Page 207]]

provide that members of such an association other than members that are 
barred from designation under section 502(b) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2462(b)) shall be treated as one country for purposes of the GSP.
9. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and taking into account the 
factors set forth in section 502(c)(19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have 
determined that East Timor should be designated as a beneficiary 
developing country under the GSP.
10. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and having considered the 
factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I have also determined 
that East Timor should be designated as a least-developed beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP.
11. In accordance with section 502(b)(1)(C) of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined that Bulgaria and Romania may no longer be designated as 
beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, effective for 
each of these countries when it becomes a European Union Member State.
12. On June 29, 2005, I determined that currently qualifying members of 
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) should be 
treated as one country for purposes of the GSP. In Proclamation 7912 of 
that date, I added SAARC and the currently qualifying countries to 
general note 4(a) to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Pursuant to 
section 507(2) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Afghanistan 
should be designated as a member of SAARC for purposes of the GSP on the 
date that it becomes a SAARC member.
13. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS of the United States the substance of 
relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import 
treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 104 of the AGOA and title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2461-67, 2483), do proclaim that:
(1) Liberia is designated as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and 
as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
(2) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 16(a) 
to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list 
of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries ``Republic of Liberia,'' 
effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after January 1, 2007.
(3) For purposes of section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA, Liberia is a 
lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
(4) East Timor is designated as a beneficiary developing country for 
purposes of the GSP.
(5) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 4(a) 
to the HTS is modified by adding in alphabetical order ``East Timor'' to 
the list entitled, ``Independent Countries,'' effective with respect to 
articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after the twentieth day after the date of this proclamation.

[[Page 208]]

(6) East Timor is designated as a least-developed beneficiary developing 
country for purposes of the GSP.
(7) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 
4(b)(i) is modified by adding in alphabetical order ``East Timor,'' 
effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after the sixty-fifth day after the date of this 
proclamation.
(8) Bulgaria and Romania shall no longer be designated as beneficiary 
developing countries for purposes of the GSP upon the date that each 
country becomes a European Union Member State. The United States Trade 
Representative shall announce each such date in a notice published in 
the Federal Register.
(9) In order to reflect these changes in the HTS, general note 4(a) to 
the HTS is modified by deleting ``Bulgaria'' and ``Romania'' from the 
list entitled, ``Independent Countries,'' effective for each of these 
countries with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse 
for consumption, on or after the day on which that country becomes a 
European Union Member State.
(10) Afghanistan is designated as a member of the South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) for purposes of the GSP on 
the date that it becomes a SAARC member. The United States Trade 
Representative shall announce such date in a notice published in the 
Federal Register.
(11) In order to reflect this determination in the HTS, general note 
4(a) to the HTS is modified by adding in alphabetical order 
``Afghanistan'' to the list entitled, ``Member Countries of the South 
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),'' effective with 
respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after the day on which Afghanistan becomes a SAARC 
member.
(12) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-
first.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Executive Order 13396 of February 7, 2006

Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Conflict in 
C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)(NEA), section 5 of the 
United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c)(UNPA), and 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to assist in addressing 
humanitarian, safety, and other concerns in or in relation to the 
country of C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire,

[[Page 210]]

I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, determine 
that the situation in or in relation to C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire, which has 
been addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1572 
of November 15, 2004, and subsequent resolutions, that has resulted in 
the massacre of large numbers of civilians, widespread human rights 
abuses, significant political violence and unrest, and attacks against 
international peacekeeping forces leading to fatalities, constitutes an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency to 
deal with that threat, and hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent that section 203(b)(1), (3), and (4) 
of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)) may apply, or to the 
extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may 
be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date of this order, all property and interests in property that are in 
the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that

are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:
    (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and
    (ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after

type of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit 
of, any person listed in or designated pursuant to this order would

in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by 
paragraph (a) of this section.

[[Page 211]]

(c) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but are

any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such

forces of a country that is taking action solely and directly to 
facilitate the evacuation of its nationals and those for whom it has 
consular responsibility in C[ocirc]te d'Ivoire; and
    (v) supplies of arms and related materiel and technical training and 
assistance intended solely for support of or use in the process of 
restructuring defense and security forces pursuant to paragraph 3, 
subparagraph (f) of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.
Sec. 4. For those persons listed in or designated pursuant to this order 
who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find 
that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets 
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken 
pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I 
therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in 
addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be 
no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 
of this order.

[[Page 212]]

Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by the IEEPA and the UNPA, as may be necessary 
to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury 
may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of 
the United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All 
executive agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed 
to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the 
provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary 
of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken. The Secretary 
of the Treasury shall ensure compliance with those provisions of section 
401 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to the Department of the 
Treasury in relation to this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine, subsequent to the 
issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the 
inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and that the property 
and interests in property of that person are therefore no longer blocked 
pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, 
benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person.
Sec. 9. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on

Blocking Property of Additional Persons in Connection With the National 
Emergency With Respect to Syria

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 5 of the 
United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c) (UNPA), 
and section 301 of title 3, United States Code; and in view of United 
Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1636 of October 31, 2005,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, determine 
that it is in the interests of the United States to (1) assist the 
international independent investigation Commission (the ``Commission'') 
established pursuant to UNSCR 1595 of April 7, 2005, (2) assist the 
Government of Lebanon in identifying and holding accountable in 
accordance with applicable law those persons who were involved in 
planning, sponsoring, organizing, or perpetrating the terrorist act in 
Beirut, Lebanon, on February 14, 2005, that resulted in the 
assassination of former Prime Minister of Lebanon Rafiq Hariri, and the 
deaths of 22 others, and other bombings or assassination attempts in 
Lebanon since October 1, 2004, that are related to Hariri's 
assassination or that implicate the Government of Syria or its officers 
or agents, and (3) take note of the Commission's conclusions in its 
report of October 19, 2005, that there is converging evidence pointing 
to both Lebanese and Syrian involvement in terrorist acts, that 
interviewees tried to mislead the Commission's investigation by giving 
false or inaccurate statements, and that a senior official of Syria 
submitted false information to the Commission. In light of these 
determinations, and to take additional steps with respect to the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004, 
concerning certain actions of the Government of Syria, I hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent that sections 203(b)(1), (3), and 
(4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3) and (4)) may apply, or to the 
extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may 
be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any

[[Page 219]]

license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of any United States person, including 
any overseas branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be 
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: persons 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State,
    (i) to be, or to have been, involved in the planning, sponsoring, 
organizing, or perpetrating of:

  (A) the terrorist act in Beirut, Lebanon, that resulted in the 
assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and the deaths 
of 22 others; or

  (B) any other bombing, assassination, or assassination attempt in Lebanon 
since October 1, 2004, that is related to Hariri's assassination or that 
implicates the Government of Syria or its officers or agents;

    (ii) to have obstructed or otherwise impeded the work of the 
Commission established pursuant to UNSCR 1595;
    (iii) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support 
of, any such terrorist act, bombing, or assassination attempt, or any 
person designated pursuant to this order; or
    (iv) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act 
for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person designated 
pursuant to this order.
    (b) I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of 
IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the 
type of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of 
any person designated pursuant to this order would seriously impair my 
ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13338, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (c) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include but 
are not limited to (i) the making of any contribution or provision of 
funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person 
designated pursuant to this order, and (ii) the receipt of any 
contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such 
person.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
    (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;

[[Page 220]]

or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign

Sec. 4. For those persons designated pursuant to this order who might 
have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, 
because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets 
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken 
pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I 
therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in 
addressing the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13338, 
there need be no prior notice of a determination made pursuant to 
section 1(a) of this order.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA and UNPA, as may be necessary to carry 
out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may 
redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the 
United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies 
of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all 
appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions 
of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the 
Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken.
Sec. 6. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, 
benefit or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person.
Sec. 7. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
April 26, 2006.

Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 2006

Blocking Property of Persons in Connection With the Conflict in Sudan's 
Darfur Region

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)(NEA), section 5 of the 
United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c)(UNPA), and 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that 
an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States is posed by the persistence of violence in 
Sudan's Darfur region, particularly against civilians and including 
sexual violence against women and girls, and by the deterioration of the 
security situation and its negative impact on humanitarian assistance 
efforts, as noted

[[Page 221]]

by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1591 of March 29, 
2005, and, to deal with that threat, hereby expand the scope of the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 
1997, with respect to the policies and actions of the Government of 
Sudan, and hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent that sections 203(b) (1), (3), and 
(4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)) may apply, or to the 
extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may 
be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date of this order, all property and interests in property of the 
following persons, that are in the United States, that hereafter come 
within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the 
possession or control of any United States person, including any 
overseas branch, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:
    (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and

     (3) the Justice and Equality Movement;
     (4) the Janjaweed; or
     (5) any person (other than a person listed in subparagraph 
(E)(1) through (E)(4) above) operating in the states of North 
Darfur, South Darfur, or West Darfur that is a belligerent, a 
nongovernmental entity, or an individual;

 (F) to be responsible for offensive military overflights in and over the 
Darfur region;

 (G) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
materiel, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, 
the activities described in paragraph (a)(ii)(A) through (F) of this 
section or any person listed in or designated pursuant to this order; or

 (H) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on 
behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person listed in or designated 
pursuant to this order.

(b) I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA 
(50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of any 
person listed

[[Page 222]]

in or designated pursuant to this order would seriously impair my 
ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13067 and expanded in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations 
as provided by paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The prohibitions of paragraph (a) of this section include, but are 
not limited to, (i) the making of any contribution or provision of 
funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person

any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such 
person.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.

materiel of all types, military aircraft, and equipment, but excludes:
     (i) supplies and technical assistance, including training, intended 
solely for use in authorized monitoring, verification, or peace support 
operations, including such operations led by regional organizations;
     (ii) supplies of non-lethal military equipment intended solely for

of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed January 9, 2005, by the

decision of the Secretary of State, after consultation with the

Sec. 4. For those persons listed in or designated pursuant to this order 
who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find 
that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets 
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken

therefore determine that, for

[[Page 223]]

be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to 
section 1 of this order.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the

out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may 
redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the 
United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies 
of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all 
appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions 
of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the 
Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken. The Secretary of the 
Treasury shall ensure compliance with those provisions of section 401 of 
the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to the Department of the Treasury in 
relation to this order.

Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency expanded by this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and

Executive Order 13405 of June 16, 2006

Blocking Property of Certain Persons Undermining Democratic Processes or 
Institutions in Belarus

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)(NEA), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, determine 
that the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of 
Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus' democratic processes or 
institutions, manifested most recently in the fundamentally undemocratic 
March 2006 elections, to commit human rights abuses related to political 
repression, including detentions and disappearances, and to engage in 
public corruption, including by diverting or misusing Belarusian public 
assets or by misusing public authority, constitute an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that 
threat, and hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), 
and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), or in 
regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant 
to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any 
license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all 
property and interests in property that are in the United States, that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of any United States person, including 
any overseas branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be 
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:

(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and

(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

     (A) to be responsible for, or to have participated in, 
actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or 
institutions in Belarus;
     (B) to be responsible for, or to have participated in, human 
rights abuses related to political repression in Belarus;
     (C) to be a senior-level official, a family member of such an 
official, or a person closely linked to such an official who is 
responsible for or has engaged in public corruption related to 
Belarus;
     (D) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided 
financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or 
services in support of,

[[Page 232]]

the activities described in paragraphs (a)(ii)(A) through (C) of 
this section or any person listed in or designated pursuant to 
this order; or
     (E) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to 
act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person listed 
in or designated pursuant to this order.
(b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person listed in or designated 
pursuant to this order would seriously impair my ability to deal with 
the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit 
such donations as provided by paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but are 
not limited to, (i) the making of any contribution or provision of 
funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person 
listed in or designated pursuant to this order, and (ii) the receipt of 
any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such 
person.
Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 4. For those persons listed in or designated pursuant to this order 
who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find 
that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets 
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken 
pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I 
therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in 
addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be 
no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 
of this order.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government, consistent with applicable law. All executive agencies of 
the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this 
order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in 
a timely manner of the measures taken. The Secretary of the Treasury 
shall ensure compliance with those

[[Page 233]]

provisions of section 401 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to the 
Department of the Treasury in relation to this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine, subsequent to the 
issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the 
inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and that the property 
and interests in property of that person are therefore no longer blocked 
pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, 
benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person.
Sec. 9. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on 
June 19, 2006.

Promoting Quality and Efficient Health Care in Federal Government 
Administered or Sponsored Health Care Programs

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States, and in order to promote federally led efforts 
to implement more transparent and high-quality health care, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. It is the purpose of this order to ensure that 
health care programs administered or sponsored by the Federal Government 
promote quality and efficient delivery of health care through the use of 
health information technology, transparency regarding health care 
quality and price, and better incentives for program beneficiaries, 
enrollees, and providers. It is the further purpose of this order to 
make relevant information available to these beneficiaries, enrollees, 
and providers in a readily useable manner and in collaboration with 
similar initiatives in the private sector and non-Federal public sector. 
Consistent with the purpose of improving the quality and efficiency of 
health care, the actions and steps taken by Federal Government agencies 
should not incur additional costs for the Federal Government.
Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
(a) ``Agency'' means an agency of the Federal Government that 
administers or sponsors a Federal health care program.
(b) ``Federal health care program'' means the Federal Employees Health 
Benefit Program, the Medicare program, programs operated directly by the 
Indian Health Service, the TRICARE program for the Department of Defense 
and other uniformed services, and the health care program operated by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. For purposes of this order, 
``Federal health care program'' does not include State operated or 
funded federally subsidized programs such as Medicaid, the State 
Children's Health Insurance Program, or services provided to Department 
of Veterans' Affairs beneficiaries under 38 U.S.C. 1703.
(c) ``Interoperability'' means the ability to communicate and exchange 
data accurately, effectively, securely, and consistently with different 
information

[[Page 241]]

technology systems, software applications, and networks in various 
settings, and exchange data such that clinical or operational purpose 
and meaning of the data are preserved and unaltered.
(d) ``Recognized interoperability standards'' means interoperability 
standards recognized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the 
``Secretary''), in accordance with guidance developed by the Secretary, 
as existing on the date of the implementation, acquisition, or upgrade 
of health information technology systems under subsections (1) or (2) of 
section 3(a) of this order.
Sec. 3. Directives for Agencies. Agencies shall perform the following 
functions:
(a) Health Information Technology.

(1) For Federal Agencies. As each agency implements, acquires, or upgrades 
health information technology systems used for the direct exchange of 
health information between agencies and with non-Federal entities, it shall 
utilize, where available, health information technology systems and 
products that meet recognized interoperability standards.

(2) For Contracting Purposes. Each agency shall require in contracts or 
agreements with health care providers, health plans, or health insurance 
issuers that as each provider, plan, or issuer implements, acquires, or 
upgrades health information technology systems, it shall utilize, where 
available, health information technology systems and products that meet 
recognized interoperability standards.

(b) Transparency of Quality Measurements.

(1) In General. Each agency shall implement programs measuring the quality 
of services supplied by health care providers to the beneficiaries or 
enrollees of a Federal health care program. Such programs shall be based 
upon standards established by multi-stakeholder entities identified by the 
Secretary or by another agency subject to this order. Each agency shall 
develop its quality measurements in collaboration with similar initiatives 
in the private and non-Federal public sectors.

(2) Facilitation. An agency satisfies the requirements of this subsection 
if it participates in the aggregation of claims and other appropriate data 
for the purposes of quality measurement. Such aggregation shall be based 
upon standards established by multi-stakeholder entities identified by the 
Secretary or by another agency subject to this order.

(c) Transparency of Pricing Information. Each agency shall make 
available (or provide for the availability) to the beneficiaries or 
enrollees of a Federal health care program (and, at the option of the 
agency, to the public) the prices that it, its health insurance issuers, 
or its health insurance plans pay for procedures to providers in the 
health care program with which the agency, issuer, or plan contracts. 
Each agency shall also, in collaboration with multi-stakeholder groups 
such as those described in subsection (b)(1), participate in the 
development of information regarding the overall costs of services for 
common episodes of care and the treatment of common chronic diseases.
(d) Promoting Quality and Efficiency of Care. Each agency shall develop 
and identify, for beneficiaries, enrollees, and providers, approaches 
that encourage and facilitate the provision and receipt of high-quality 
and efficient

[[Page 242]]

health care. Such approaches may include pay-for-performance models of 
reimbursement consistent with current law. An agency will satisfy the 
requirements of this subsection if it makes available to beneficiaries 
or enrollees consumer-directed health care insurance products.
Sec. 4. Implementation Date. Agencies shall comply with the requirements 
of this order by January 1, 2007.
Sec. 5. Administration and Judicial Review.
(a) This order does not assume or rely upon additional Federal resources 
or spending to promote quality and efficient health care. Further, the 
actions directed by this order shall be carried out subject to the 
availability of appropriations and to the maximum extent permitted by 
law.
(b) This order shall be implemented in new contracts or new contract 
cycles as they may be renewed from time to time. Renegotiation outside 
of the normal contract cycle processes should be avoided.
(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity 
against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its 
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Executive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006

Blocking Property of and Prohibiting Transactions With the Government of 
Sudan

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.)(NEA), and section 301 
of title 3, United States Code, and taking appropriate account of the 
Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (the ``Act''),
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that, 
due to the continuation of the threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States created by certain policies and 
actions of the

[[Page 245]]

Government of Sudan that violate human rights, in particular with 
respect to the conflict in Darfur, where the Government of Sudan 
exercises administrative and legal authority and pervasive practical 
influence, and due to the threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States posed by the pervasive role played by the 
Government of Sudan in the petroleum and petrochemical industries in 
Sudan, it is in the interests of the United States to take additional 
steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13067 of November 3, 1997. Accordingly, I hereby order:
Section 1. Except to the extent provided in section 203(b) of IEEPA (50 
U.S.C. 1702(b)) or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that 
may be issued pursuant to this order, all property and interests in 
property of the Government of Sudan that are in the United States, that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of United States persons, including 
their overseas branches, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, 
exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.
Sec. 2. Except to the extent provided in section 203(b) of IEEPA (50 
U.S.C. 1702(b)) or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that 
may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date of this order, all transactions by United States persons relating 
to the petroleum or petrochemical industries in Sudan, including, but 
not limited to, oilfield services and oil or gas pipelines, are 
prohibited.
Sec. 3. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 4. (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, restrictions 
imposed by this order shall be in addition to, and do not derogate from, 
restrictions imposed in and under Executive Order 13067.
(b)(i) None of the prohibitions in section 2 of Executive Order 13067 
shall apply to activities or related transactions with respect to 
Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, 
Abyei, Darfur, or marginalized areas in and around Khartoum, provided 
that the activities or transactions do not involve any property or 
interests in property of the Government of Sudan.
(ii) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Secretary of 
the Treasury, may define the term ``Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan/
Nuba Mountains State, Blue Nile State, Abyei, Darfur, or marginalized 
areas in and around Khartoum'' for the purposes of this order.
(c) The function of the President under subsection 6(c)(1) of the 
Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-497), as 
amended by section 5(a)(3) of the Act, is assigned to the Secretary of 
the Treasury as appropriate in the performance of such function.
(d) The functions of the President under subsection 6(c)(2) and the last 
sentence of 6(d) of the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 (Public

[[Page 246]]

Law 108-497), as amended by subsections 5(a)(3) and (b), respectively, 
of the Act, are assigned to the Secretary of State, except that the 
function of denial of entry is assigned to the Secretary of Homeland 
Security.
(e) The functions of the President under sections 7 and 8 of the Act are 
assigned to the Secretary of State.
Sec. 5. Nothing in this order shall prohibit:
(a) transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal 
Government or the United Nations by employees thereof; or
(b) transactions in Sudan for journalistic activity by persons regularly 
employed in such capacity by a news-gathering organization.
Sec. 6. For the purposes of this order:
(a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
(b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint 
venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;
(c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, 
permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United 
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States; and
(d) the term ``Government of Sudan'' includes the Government of Sudan, 
its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities, and the 
Central Bank of Sudan, but does not include the regional government of 
Southern Sudan.
Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who might have a 
constitutional presence in the United States, I find that, because of 
the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior 
notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order 
would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for 
these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 13067 there need be no prior notice of a 
determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 8. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government, consistent with applicable law. All executive agencies of 
the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this 
order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in 
a timely manner of the measures taken. The Secretary of the Treasury 
shall ensure compliance with those provisions of section 401 of the NEA 
(50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to the Department of the Treasury in 
relation to this order.
Sec. 9. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, 
benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person.

Peace and Accountability Act of 2006.

Resolution 1649 of December 21, 2005, and Resolution 1698 of July 31,

policy of the United States and hereby declare a national emergency to 
deal with that threat. To address that threat, I hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent that section 203(b)(1), (3), and (4) 
of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)) may apply, or to the 
extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may 
be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract 
entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective 
date of this order, all property and interests in property that are in 
the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that 
are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States 
persons, including their overseas branches, of the following persons are 
blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or 
otherwise dealt in:

(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and

(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

(A) to be a political or military leader of a foreign armed group operating 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that impedes the disarmament, 
repatriation, or resettlement of combatants;

(B) to be a political or military leader of a Congolese armed group that 
impedes the disarmament, demobilization, or reintegration of combatants;

[[Page 248]]

(C) to be a political or military leader recruiting or using children in 
armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in violation of 
applicable international law;

(D) to have committed serious violations of international law involving the 
targeting of children in situations of armed conflict in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, including killing and maiming, sexual violence, 
abduction, and forced displacement;

(E) to have directly or indirectly supplied, sold, or transferred to the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, or been the recipient in the territory of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo of, arms and related materiel, 
including military aircraft and equipment, or advice, training, or 
assistance, including financing and financial assistance, related to 
military activities;

(F) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, 
material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, 
the activities described in subsections (a)(ii)(A) through (E) of this 
section or any person listed in or designated pursuant to this order; or

(G) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on 
behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person listed in or designated 
pursuant to this order.

(b) I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of the IEEPA 
(50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of any person 
listed in or designated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section would 
seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in 
this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by subsection 
(a) of this section.

(c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section include but are not 
limited to (i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person listed in or 
designated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, and (ii) the receipt 
of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such 
person.

Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
(b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth 
in this order is prohibited.
Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order:

branches), or any person in the United States.

[[Page 249]]

Sec. 4. For those persons listed in or designated pursuant to this order 
who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find 
that, because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets 
instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken 
pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I 
therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in 
addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be 
no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to 
subsection 1(a) of this order.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by the IEEPA and the UNPA as may be necessary 
to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury 
may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of 
the United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All 
executive agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed 
to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the 
provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary 
of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken. The Secretary 
of the Treasury shall ensure compliance with those provisions of section 
401 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to the Department of the 
Treasury in relation to this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and 
final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this 
order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and 
section 204(c) of the IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized, subsequent to the issuance of 
this order, to determine, and to take necessary action to give effect to 
that determination, that circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of 
the property and interests in property of, or the prohibiting of 
transactions with, a person listed in the Annex to this order.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, 
benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or 
in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, 
agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or 
any other person.
Sec. 9. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on 
October 30, 2006.

Notice of January 10, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on subsequent 
occasions, the Cuban government stated its intent to forcefully defend 
its sovereignty against any U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft that 
might enter Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a 
flotilla or peaceful protest. Since these events, the Cuban government 
has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the future use of 
reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may 
engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. On 
February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757, the scope of the national 
emergency was expanded in order to deny monetary and material support to 
the repressive Cuban government, which had taken a series of steps to 
destabilize relations with the United States, including threatening to 
abrogate the Migration Accords with the United States and to close the 
United States Interests Section.
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority relating to 
the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set out in 
Proclamation 6687, as amended and expanded by Proclamation 7757.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of January 18, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex

[[Page 273]]

to Executive Order 12947 to identify four additional persons, including 
Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, as expanded 
on August 20, 1998, and the measures adopted on those dates to deal with 
that emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 2006. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the 
Middle East peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of February 27, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Persons 
Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, I declared a national 
emergency blocking the property of persons undermining democratic 
processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action 
to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy 
of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions, thus contributing to 
the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically 
motivated violence and intimidation in that country, and to political 
and economic instability in the southern African region. On November 22, 
2005, I issued Executive Order 13391 to take additional steps with 
respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 and 
to block the property of additional persons undermining democratic 
processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date and on November 22, 2005, to deal with 
that emergency, must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2006. Therefore, 
in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in 
Zimbabwe.

Export-Import Bank Programs for or in Libya

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws 
of the United States of America, including sections 620A and 621 of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2371 and 2381), 
section 113 in Division J of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 
(Public Law 108-447):
    1. I hereby determine that:
    (a) national security interests justify a waiver of the 
prohibition in subsection (a) of section 620A of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961 with

[[Page 276]]

respect to the provision of assistance under the Export-Import 
Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12 U.S.C. 635 et seq.), for Libya; 
and
    (b) it is important to the national security interests of the 
United States that direct loans, credits, insurance, and 
guarantees of the Export-Import Bank or its agents may be made 
available for or in Libya, notwithstanding section 507 or similar 
provisions in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and 
Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2005 (Division D of Public 
Law 108-447), or prior acts making appropriations for foreign 
operations, export financing, and related programs.
    2. I hereby waive, through the date that is 24 months from the date 
of this memorandum, the prohibition in subsection (a) of section 620A of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 with respect to the provision of 
assistance under the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended, for 
Libya.
    3. The function of the President under subsection (d) of section 
620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is assigned to the Secretary 
of State, effective on the date that is 22 months from the date of this 
memorandum, with respect to provision of assistance under the Export-
Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended, for Libya.

Notice of March 13, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued 
Executive Order 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat, and on August 19, 1997, the President issued 
Executive Order 13059 consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2006. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is 
distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2005.

Notice of May 18, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency Protecting the Development Fund 
for Iraq and Certain Other Property in Which Iraq Has an Interest

On May 22, 2003, by Executive Order 13303, I declared a national 
emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other 
property in which Iraq has an interest, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (IEEPA). I took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the obstacles 
to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance 
of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq constituted by the 
threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Development 
Fund for Iraq, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests 
therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any 
nature whatsoever arising from or related to the sale or marketing 
thereof.
On August 28, 2003, in Executive Order 13315, I expanded the scope of 
this national emergency to block the property of the former Iraqi 
regime, its senior officials and their family members as the removal of 
Iraqi property from that country by certain senior officials of the 
former Iraqi regime and their immediate family members constitutes an 
obstacle to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and 
maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of 
political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq.
On July 29, 2004, in Executive Order 13350, I amended the Annex to 
Executive Order 13315 to include certain persons determined to have been 
subject to economic sanctions pursuant to Executive Orders 12722 and 
12724. Because of their association with the prior Iraqi regime, I 
determined that these persons present an obstacle to the orderly 
reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and 
security in that country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq and, therefore, such 
persons should be subject to sanctions under Executive Order 13315.
Executive Order 13350 also amended Executive Order 13290 of March 20, 
2003, in which, consistent with section 203(a)(1)(C) of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. 
1702(a)(1)(C), I ordered that certain blocked funds held in the United 
States in accounts in the name of the Government of Iraq, the Central 
Bank of Iraq, Rafidain Bank, Rasheed Bank, or the State Organization for 
Marketing Oil be confiscated and vested in the Department of the 
Treasury. I originally exercised these authorities pursuant to the 
national emergency in Executive Order 12722. In light of the changed 
circumstances in Iraq and my decision to terminate the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 12722, I determined that the 
exercise of authorities in Executive Order 13290 should continue in 
order to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
13303 of May 22, 2003, as expanded in scope in Executive Order 13315 of 
August 28, 2003, regarding the obstacles posed to the orderly 
reconstruction of Iraq. Executive Order 13350 amends Executive Order 
13290 to that effect.

[[Page 290]]

On November 29, 2004, in Executive Order 13364, I modified the scope of 
this national emergency to address the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed 
by the threat of attachment or other judicial process against the 
Central Bank of Iraq. I also determined that, consistent with United 
Nations Security Council Resolutions 1483 and 1546, the steps taken in 
Executive Order 13303 to deal with this national emergency need to be 
limited so that such steps do not apply with respect to any final 
judgment arising out of a contractual obligation entered into by the 
Government of Iraq, including any agency or instrumentality thereof, 
after June 30, 2004, and so that, with respect to Iraqi petroleum and 
petroleum products and interests therein, such steps shall apply only 
until title passes to the initial purchaser.
Because the obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared on May 22, 2003, and the measures adopted on that 
date, August 28, 2003, July 29, 2004, and November 29, 2004, to deal 
with that emergency must continue in effect beyond May 22, 2006. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other 
property in which Iraq has an interest.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of May 18, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma

On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, certifying 
to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-208), that the Government of Burma has committed large-scale 
repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 
1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
United States persons contained in that section. The President also 
declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions 
and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter 
alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq. On July 28, 2003, I issued Executive Order 13310 taking 
additional steps with respect to that

[[Page 291]]

national emergency by putting in place an import ban required by the 
Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and prohibiting exports of 
financial services to Burma and the dealing in property in which certain 
designated Burmese persons have an interest.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that 
emergency must continue in effect beyond May 20, 2006. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to Burma. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register

Notice of June 19, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Usable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``order''), blocking property and interests in property of the 
Government of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that 
hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come 
within the possession or control of United States persons that are 
directly related to the implementation of the Agreement Between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Russian Federation Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium 
Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related 
contracts and agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU 
Agreements allow for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived 
from nuclear weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial 
purposes. The order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., and 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
posed by the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation 
of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of 
the Russian Federation.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2006, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western 
Balkans

On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the Western Balkans pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of 
persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) 
extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia, and elsewhere in the 
Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the 
Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo. Subsequent to the declaration of the 
national emergency, the actions of persons obstructing implementation of 
the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in the Republic of Macedonia also 
became a pressing concern. I amended Executive Order 13219 on May 28, 
2003, in Executive Order 13304 to address this concern and to take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency. Because the 
actions of persons threatening the peace and international stabilization 
efforts in the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the 
measures adopted on that date and thereafter to deal with that 
emergency, must continue in effect beyond June 26, 2006. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50

Consistent with the authority contained in section 604 of the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (the

Authority with certain commitments, I hereby impose the sanction set out

Notice of July 18, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Certain 
Persons and Prohibiting the Importation of Certain Goods from Liberia

On July 22, 2004, by Executive Order 13348, I declared a national 
emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain 
persons and prohibiting the importation of certain goods from Liberia, 
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of former Liberian President 
Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular their unlawful depletion 
of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of 
Liberian funds and property, which have undermined Liberia's transition 
to democracy and the orderly development of its political, 
administrative, and economic institutions and resources. I further noted 
that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on August 18, 2003, and 
the related ceasefire had not yet been universally implemented 
throughout Liberia, and that the illicit trade in round logs and timber 
products was linked to the proliferation of and trafficking in illegal 
arms, which perpetuated the Liberian conflict and fueled and exacerbated 
other conflicts throughout West Africa.
Today, Liberia is making a transition to a peaceful, democratic order 
under the new administration of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf. Charles 
Taylor is in the custody of the Special Court for Sierra Leone in The 
Hague. However, the stability in Liberia is fragile. The actions and 
policies of Charles Taylor and others have left a legacy of destruction 
that still has the potential to undermine Liberia's transformation and 
recovery.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States,

[[Page 300]]

the national emergency declared on July 22, 2004, and the measures 
adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue in 
effect beyond July 22, 2006. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am

On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided me under the

light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National

interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in 
illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary because 
of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the 
national security of that country; and (2) that country has appropriate

and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which shall at a

the use of force is directed against the aircraft.

Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act 
of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is 
important to the national interest that up to $13.5 million be made

Presidential Determination No. 2006-23 of September 13, 2006

Continuation of the Exercise of Certain Authorities under the Trading

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of the

Under section 101(b) of Public Law 95-223 (91 Stat. 1625; 50 U.S.C. App.

Presidential Determination No. 2006-24 of September 15, 2006

Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug 
Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2007

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
FY03 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following 
countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing 
countries: Afghanistan,

[[Page 305]]

The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, 
Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, 
Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.
A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse 
reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of 
cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory 
definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth 
in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit 
drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of 
geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to 
transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous 
enforcement measures.
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma and 
Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 
12 months to adhere to their obligations under international 
counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 
489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report (Tab A) are justifications 
for the determinations on Burma and Venezuela, as required by section 
706(2)(B).
I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 
706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Venezuela's 
democratic institutions is vital to the national interests of the United 
States.
Although President Karzai has strongly attacked narcotrafficking as the 
greatest threat to Afghanistan, one third of the Afghan economy remains 
opium-based, which contributes to widespread public corruption. The 
government at all levels must be held accountable to deter and eradicate 
poppy cultivation; remove and prosecute corrupt officials; and 
investigate, prosecute, or extradite narcotraffickers and those 
financing their activities. We are concerned that failure to act 
decisively now could undermine security, compromise democratic 
legitimacy, and imperil international support for vital assistance.
My Administration is concerned with the decline in Bolivian 
counternarcotics cooperation since October 2005. Bolivia, the world's 
third largest producer of cocaine, has undertaken policies that have 
allowed the expansion of coca cultivation and slowed the pace of 
eradication until mid-year, when it picked up. The Government of 
Bolivia's (GOB) policy of ``zero cocaine, but not zero coca'' has 
focused primarily on interdiction, to the near exclusion of its 
necessary complements, eradication and alternative development. However, 
the GOB has been supportive of interdiction initiatives and has had 
positive results in seizing cocaine and decommissioning rustic labs. We 
would encourage the GOB to refocus its efforts on eliminating excess 
coca, the source of cocaine. This would include eradicating at least 
5,000 hectares, including in the Chapare region; eliminating the 
``cato'' exemption to Bolivian law; rescinding Ministerial Resolution 
112, Administrative Resolution 083, and establishing tight controls on 
the sale of licit coca leaf for traditional use; and implementing strong 
precursor chemical control measures to prevent conversion of coca to 
cocaine. My Administration plans to review Bolivia's performance in 
these specific areas within 6 months.

[[Page 306]]

The Government of Canada (GOC) continued to effectively curb the 
diversion of precursor chemicals that are required for methamphetamine 
production to feed U.S. illegal markets. The GOC also continued to seize 
laboratories that produce MDMA/Ecstasy consumed in both Canada and the 
United States. The principal drug concern was the continuing large-scale 
production of high-potency, indoor-grown marijuana for export to the 
United States. The United States enjoyed excellent cooperation with 
Canada across a broad range of law enforcement issues and shared goals.
The Government of Ecuador (GOE) has made considerable progress in 
combating narcotics trafficking destined for the United States. However, 
a dramatic increase in the quantity of cocaine transported toward the 
United States using Ecuadorian-flagged ships and indications of 
increased illegal armed group activity along Ecuador's northern border 
with Colombia remain areas of serious concern. Effective cooperation and 
streamlined maritime operational procedures between the U.S. Coast Guard 
and the Ecuadorian Navy are resulting in an increase in the amount of 
cocaine interdicted. Building on that cooperation, we will work with 
Ecuador to change the circumstances that make Ecuadorian-flagged vessels 
and Ecuadorian citizenship so attractive to drug traffickers.
As a result of the elections in Haiti, the new government now has a 
clear mandate from the Haitian people to bring crime, violent gangs, and 
drug trafficking under control. We urge the new government to strengthen 
and accelerate ongoing efforts to rebuild and reform Haiti's law 
enforcement and judicial institutions and to consult closely with the 
United States to define achievable and verifiable steps to accomplish 
these goals.
While the Government of Nigeria continues to take substantive steps to 
curb official corruption, it remains a major challenge in Nigeria. We 
strongly encourage the government to continue to adequately fund and 
support the anti-corruption bodies that have been established there in 
order to fully address Nigeria's ongoing fight against corruption. We 
urge Nigeria to continue improving the effectiveness of the National 
Drug and Law Enforcement Agency and, in particular, improve enforcement 
operations at major airports/seaports and against major drug kingpins, 
to include targeting their financial assets. We look forward to working 
with Nigerian officials to increase extraditions and assisting in drug 
enforcement operations.
Although there have not been any drug seizures or apprehensions of drug 
traffickers with a connection to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) since 2004, we remain concerned about DPRK state-directed 
criminal activity. The United States Government has made clear to the 
DPRK that an end to all involvement in criminal activity is a necessary 
prerequisite to entry into the international community.
Under provisions of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA), 
which modified section 489(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended, and section 490(a) of the FAA, a report will be made to the 
Congress on March 1, 2007, naming the five countries that legally 
exported the largest amount of methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as 
well as the top five methamphetamine precursor importers with the 
highest rate of diversion for illicit drug production. This report will 
be sent concurrently with the International Narcotics Control Strategy 
Report, which will also contain additional reporting on methamphetamine 
precursor chemicals pursuant to the CMEA.

Notice of September 21, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Persons Who 
Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support Terrorism

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or 
support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the grave acts 
of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, 
including the terrorist attacks in New York, in Pennsylvania, and 
against the Pentagon of September 11, 2001, and the continuing and 
immediate threat of further attacks against United States nationals or 
the United States. Because the actions of these persons who commit, 
threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the United States, the national emergency 
declared on September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date to 
deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23, 
2006. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to 
commit, or support terrorism.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Presidential Determination on FY 2007 Refugee Admissions Numbers and 
Authorizations of In-Country Refugee Status Pursuant to Sections 207 and 
101(a)(42), respectively, of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and 
Determination Pursuant to Section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Act, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
In accordance with section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(the ``Act'') (8 U.S.C. 1157), as amended, and after appropriate 
consultations with the Congress, I hereby make the following 
determinations and authorize the following actions:
The admission of up to 70,000 refugees to the United States during FY 
2007 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the 
national interest; provided, however, that this number shall be 
understood as including persons admitted to the United States during FY 
2007 with Federal refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian 
immigrant admissions program, as provided below. The ceiling shall be 
construed as a maximum not to be exceeded, and not a minimum to be 
achieved.
The 70,000 admissions shall be allocated among refugees of special 
humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the 
following regional allocations; provided, however, that the number of 
admissions allocated to the East Asia region shall include persons 
admitted to the United States during FY 2007 with Federal refugee 
resettlement assistance under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, 
Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988, as 
contained in section 101(e) of Public Law 100-202 (Amerasian immigrants 
and their family members); provided further that the number of 
admissions allocated to the former Soviet Union shall include persons 
admitted who were nationals of the former Soviet Union, or in the case 
of persons having no nationality, who were habitual residents of the 
former Soviet Union prior to September 2, 1991:


 
 
 
Africa                                     22,000
East Asia                                  11,000
Europe and Central Asia                    6,500
Latin America/Caribbean                    5,000
Near East/South Asia                       5,500
Unallocated                                20,000
 


The 20,000 unallocated refugee admissions shall be allocated to regional 
ceilings as needed. Upon providing notification to the Judiciary 
Committees of the Congress, you are hereby authorized to use unallocated 
admissions in regions where the need for additional admissions arises.
Additionally, upon notification to the Judiciary Committees of the 
Congress, you are further authorized to transfer unused admissions 
allocated to a particular region to one or more other regions, if there 
is a need for greater admissions for the region or regions to which the 
admissions are being

[[Page 317]]

transferred. Consistent with section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and 
Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, I hereby determine that 
assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for admission to the 
United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will 
contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States and 
designate such persons for this purpose.
Consistent with section 101(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)) and 
after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I also specify that, 
for FY 2007, the following persons may, if otherwise qualified, be 
considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the United States 
within their countries of nationality or habitual residence:
                                                                      a.
     Persons in Vietnam

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C 
2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Brazil, that (1) interdiction 
of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in illicit drug

procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life in the air 
and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which shall at a 
minimum include effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before 
the use of force is directed against the aircraft.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this

Notice of October 19, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant 
Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant 
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, and the extreme level of 
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States 
and abroad.
The order blocks all property and interests in property that are in the 
United States, or within the possession or control of United States 
persons, of foreign persons listed in an annex to the order, as well as 
of foreign persons determined to play a significant role in 
international narcotics trafficking centered in Colombia. The order 
similarly blocks all property and interests in property of foreign 
persons determined to materially assist in, or provide financial or 
technological support for or goods or services in support of, the 
narcotics trafficking activities of persons designated in or pursuant to 
the order. In addition, the order blocks all property and interests in 
property of persons determined to be owned or controlled by, or to act 
for or on behalf of, persons designated in or pursuant to the order. The 
order also prohibits any transaction or dealing by United States persons 
or

[[Page 319]]

within the United States in property or interests in property of the 
persons designated in or pursuant to the order.
Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States and to cause an extreme level of violence, 
corruption, and harm in the United States and abroad, the national 
emergency declared on October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted 
pursuant thereto to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect 
beyond October 21, 2006. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of October 27, 2006

Continuation of National Emergency Regarding the Proliferation of 
Weapons of Mass Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical 
weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the means of delivering such 
weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued Executive Order 13094 
amending Executive Order 12938 to respond more effectively to the 
worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation 
activities. On June 28, 2005, I issued Executive Order 13382 that, inter 
alia, further amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our ability to 
combat proliferation. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means of delivering them continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency first 
declared on November 14, 1994, must continue in effect beyond November 
14, 2006. In accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of November 1, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan

On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Sudan pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
the Government of Sudan. On April 26, 2006, by Executive Order 13400, I 
expanded the national emergency by determining that the conflict in 
Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I ordered 
the blocking of property of certain persons connected to that conflict. 
On October 13, 2006, I issued Executive Order 13412 to amend the 
comprehensive sanctions with respect to Sudan set forth in Executive 
Order 13067.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
November 3, 1997, as expanded on April 26, 2006, must continue in effect 
beyond November 3, 2006. Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency with respect to Sudan.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Memorandum of November 6, 2006

Determinations Under Section 1106(a) of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988--Socialist Republic of Vietnam

Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
Consistent with section 1006(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness 
Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 2905(a)) (the ``Act''), I determine that state 
trading enterprises account for a significant share of the exports of 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam) and goods that compete with 
imports into Vietnam. I further determine that such state trading 
enterprises unduly burden and restrict, or adversly affect, the foreign 
trade of the United States or the United States economy, or are likely 
to result in such burden, restriction, or effect.

[[Page 321]]

Vietnam is seeking to become a member of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). The terms and conditions for Vietnam's accession to the WTO 
include Vietnam's commitments that it will ensure that all state trading 
enterprises within the meaning of section 1106 will make purchases not 
for governmental use and sales in international trade based solely on 
commercial considerations (including price, quality, availability, 
marketability, and transportation) and that U.S. firms will have an 
adequate opportunity, in accordance with customary business practice, to 
compete for participation in sales to and purcahses from these 
enterprises on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions. In addition, the 
Government of Vietnam will not influence, directly or indirectly, 
commercial decisions on the part of state trading enterprises, including 
decisions on the quantity, value, or country of origin of any goods 
purchased or sold, except in a manner consistent with the Marrakesh 
Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement) and 
the rights accorded to nongovernmental enterprise owners or 
shareholders.
The obligations that Vietnam will assume under the WTO Agreement, 
including Vietnam's protocol of accession, meet the requirements of 
section 1106(b)(2)(A) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2905(b)(2)(A)), and thus my 
determinations under section 1106(a) do not require invocation of the 
nonapplication provisions of the WTO Agreement.
You are directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of November 9, 2006

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in 
Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, 
and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with 
Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2006. Therefore, 
consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year this national emergency with

Order of November 17, 2006

Regarding the Proposed Merger of Alcatel and Lucent Technologies, Inc.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 721 of the 
Defense Production Act of 1950 (section 721), 50 U.S.C. App. 2170,
Section 1. Findings.
I hereby make the following findings:

[[Page 323]]

(1) there is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Alcatel, a 
societe anonyme organized under the laws of France, through exercising 
control of Lucent Technologies, Inc. (Lucent), a corporation organized 
under the laws of the State of Delaware, might take action that 
threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and
(2) provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701et seq.), do not in my 
judgment provide adequate and appropriate authority for me to protect 
the national security in this matter.
Sec 2. Actions Ordered and Authorized.
On the basis of the findings set forth in section 1 of this order and 
pursuant to my authority under applicable law, including section 721, I 
hereby order that:
(1) any merger of Lucent and Alcatel that does not meet the following 
conditions within the timeframes specified is prohibited:
(a) Lucent, Alcatel, and Alcatel USA Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Alcatel, execute, on or before the closing date of the transaction, a 
National Security Agreement (NSA) with the Departments of Defense (DOD), 
Justice, Commerce, and Homeland Security, that is materially identical 
to the draft NSA negotiated with those agencies as of November 6, 2006;
(b) Lucent and Alcatel execute, by a date to be determined by the 
Secretary of Defense, a Special Security Agreement (SSA) with the DOD 
that is materially identical to the draft SSA negotiated with the DOD as 
of November 6, 2006; and
(c) the Secure Subsidiary, which is defined in the draft SSA and which 
will be a subsidiary of Lucent, execute the two documents described in 
(a) and (b) above, by a date to be determined by the Secretary of 
Defense;
(2) the Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to 
enforce this order.
Sec 3. Reservation.
I hereby reserve my authority until such time as the NSA and SSA are 
executed as required by this order, or, if the NSA and SSA are not so 
executed, until such time as the prohibition of the merger required by 
this order has been fully enforced, to issue further orders with respect 
to the parties as shall in my judgment be necessary to protect the 
national security.
Sec 4. Publication.
This order shall be published in the Federal Register.

handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, 
or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may 
not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, 
on the basis of handicap--
    (i) Deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
    (ii) Afford a qualified individual with handicaps an opportunity to 
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not 
equal to that afforded others;

benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal 
opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to 
reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;
    (iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to 
individuals with handicaps or to any class of individuals with handicaps

discrimination on the basis of handicap.
    (6) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification

to discrimination on the basis of handicap, nor may the agency establish 
requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified

activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are 
not, themselves, covered by this regulation.

<R05>
Sec. Sec. 102.131-102.139  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.140  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 102.141-102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 339]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec. 102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.


<R05>
Sec. 102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

[[Page 340]]

apply to buildings covered by this section.

<R05>
Sec. 102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

    (b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations of 
section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29

    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed
