              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2006), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of textual material 
appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE

    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
 Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
                                      Executive Office of the President.

         The 2005 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
      signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
   Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
     criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
       documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
 President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
                   updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

       Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2005 
 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 7859 
      appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2005 Comp., p. 1.'' 
          Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
 abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this 
                                               book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

            This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
 Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
  13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
  and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
                  2006, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

     For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
     Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
 Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
          Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
     statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
 Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
                                                               DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
      Division by Kathleen M. Fargey and Stephen J. Frattini, under the 
                                  supervision of Gwendolyn J. Henderson.

Proclamation 7860 of January 7, 2005

To Extend Nondiscriminatory Trade Treatment (Normal Trade Relations 
Treatment) to the Products of Armenia

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Since declaring its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, 
Armenia has made considerable progress in enacting market reforms and on 
February 5, 2003, Armenia acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
The extension of unconditional normal trade relations treatment to the 
products of Armenia will permit the United States to avail itself of all 
rights under the WTO with respect to Armenia. Armenia has demonstrated a 
strong desire to build a friendly and cooperative relationship with the 
United States and has been found to be in full compliance with the 
freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the Trade Act of 
1974 (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.).
2. Pursuant to section 2001(b) of Public Law 108-429, 118 Stat. 2588, 
and having due regard for the findings of the Congress in section 
2001(a) of said law, I hereby determine that chapter 1 of title IV of 
the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2431-2439) should no longer apply to Armenia.
3. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes 
the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts 
affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 
2001(b) of Public Law 108-429, and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do 
proclaim that:
    (1) Nondiscriminatory trade treatment (normal trade relations 
treatment) shall be extended to the products of Armenia, which shall no 
longer be subject to chapter 1 of title IV of the 1974 Act.
    (2) The extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to products of 
Armenia shall be effective as of the date of signature of this 
proclamation.
    (3) All provisions of previous proclamations and executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 7861 of January 12, 2005

A Proclamation

All Americans are grateful for the special people who played a positive 
role in their childhood. Whether a relative, teacher, coach, or 
community leader, a dedicated mentor can profoundly change a young 
person's life. During National Mentoring Month, we recognize the role 
models who have influenced lives, and we continue to support programs 
that help the young people of America.
Mentoring programs pair a child in need with a caring adult who can help 
that child understand the importance of making the right choices in 
life. It is one of the best ways to send young people the right 
messages. Through friendship and encouragement, mentors can help prepare 
young Americans for a hopeful future.
My Administration has supported mentoring programs for young people at 
risk. In August 2004, my Administration made available over $45 million 
in grants to help provide mentors for children with parents in prison. 
In addition, my Administration provided $48 million in school-based 
grants in 2004 to provide at-risk youth with mentors to assist them in 
the successful transition from elementary to secondary school.
One mentor can change a life forever. I encourage all of our citizens to 
dedicate their time and talents to mentoring a young person. By 
providing help and hope to our youth, mentors help foster a more 
compassionate society that values every life and leaves no child behind.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2005 as National 
Mentoring Month. I call upon the people of the United States to 
recognize the importance of mentoring, to look for opportunities to 
serve as mentors in their communities, and to celebrate this month with 
appropriate activities and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7862 of January 14, 2005

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was a visionary American and a dedicated 
leader who believed deeply in liberty and dignity for every person. His 
faith

[[Page 4]]

and courage continue to inspire America and the world. We honor his life 
and his work.
Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr. King witnessed firsthand the 
injustice of a segregated society. He realized that change was necessary 
to ensure the full promise of our Constitution for all Americans, and 
his charismatic leadership awakened the conscience of America.
Dr. King's dream inspired our Nation with what he called ``a certain 
kind of fire that no water could put out.'' Since Dr. King's involvement 
in the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s, Americans have 
witnessed the power of the law to prevent injustice and encourage the 
finest qualities of our Nation. Last year, we celebrated the 40th 
anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Once this landmark 
legislation was signed into law, Americans could no longer be denied a 
room in a hotel or a table at a restaurant because of their race.
Our Nation has accomplished much over the past 40 years. Our journey 
toward justice and equality has not always been an easy one, and it is 
not over. However long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and 
justice for all. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., believed in the good that 
exists in all men and women. We will remember the work of Dr. King as we 
continue striving to meet the founding ideals of our great Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 17, 2005, 
as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all 
Americans to observe this day with appropriate activities and programs 
that honor the memory and legacy of Dr. King.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7863 of January 14, 2005

National Sanctity of Human Life Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Declaration of Independence proclaimed that all Americans are 
endowed by the Creator with the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. On National Sanctity of Human Life Day, we 
celebrate the sacred gift of life.
We have a responsibility in America to defend the life of the innocent 
and the powerless. Our Nation has made significant progress in recent 
years toward building a culture of life. Last year, I signed into law 
the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004, which provides that any 
person who causes death or injury to a pregnant woman commits two 
separate offenses. I worked with members of both parties to ban the 
brutal practice of partial-

[[Page 5]]

birth abortion, and I signed the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act. 
Working with the Congress, my Administration has halted spending of 
taxpayers' money on international programs that promote abortions 
overseas. We continue to promote abstinence education, adoption 
programs, crisis pregnancy programs, and other efforts to help protect 
life.
My Administration remains committed to the steadfast belief in the 
dignity of every human being and the promise of every life. Across our 
country, we must continue to encourage our citizens to make ours a more 
just and welcoming society in which every child is born into a loving 
family and protected by law. We will work with decency and respect to 
change hearts and minds, one person at a time. In doing so, we will 
build a lasting culture of life and a more compassionate society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, January 16, 2005, 
as National Sanctity of Human Life Day. I call upon all Americans to 
recognize this day with appropriate ceremonies in our homes and places 
of worship and to reaffirm our commitment to respecting the life and 
dignity of every human being.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7864 of January 14, 2005

Religious Freedom Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

George Washington wrote, ``The liberty enjoyed by the people of these 
States, of worshipping Almighty God agreeably to their consciences, is 
not only among the choicest of their blessings, but also of their 
rights.'' On Religious Freedom Day, Americans commemorate the passage of 
the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786, which helped set the 
course for freedom of religion to be included in the First Amendment to 
our Constitution.
Our Founding Fathers knew the importance of freedom of religion to a 
stable and lasting Union. Our Constitution protects individuals' rights 
to worship as they choose. Today, we continue to welcome the important 
contributions of people of faith in our society. We reject religious 
bigotry in every form, striving for a society that honors the life and 
faith of every person. As we maintain the vitality of a pluralistic 
society, we work to ensure equal treatment of faith-based organizations 
and people of faith.
As the United States advances the cause of liberty, we remember that 
freedom is not America's gift to the world, but God's gift to each man 
and woman in this world. This truth drives our efforts to help people 
everywhere achieve freedom of religion and establish a better, brighter, 
and more peaceful future for all.

[[Page 6]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2005, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I encourage all Americans to reflect on the great 
blessing of religious freedom, to endeavor to preserve this freedom for 
future generations, and to commemorate this day through appropriate 
events and activities in homes, schools, and places of worship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of

Proclamation 7865 of January 25, 2005

60th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz Concentration Camp, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

At the Auschwitz concentration camp, evil found willing servants and 
innocent victims. For almost 5 years, Auschwitz was a factory for murder 
where more than a million lives were taken. It is a sobering reminder of 
the power of evil and the need for people to oppose evil wherever it 
exists. It is a reminder that when we find anti-Semitism, we must come 
together to fight it.
In places like Auschwitz, evidence of the horror of the Holocaust has 
been preserved to help the world remember the past. We must never forget 
the cruelty of the guilty and the courage of the victims at Auschwitz 
and other Nazi concentration camps.
During the Holocaust, evil was systematic in its implementation and 
deliberate in its destruction. The 60th anniversary of the liberation of 
Auschwitz is an opportunity to pass on the stories and lessons of the 
Holocaust to future generations. The history of the Holocaust 
demonstrates that evil is real, but hope endures.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 27, 2005, as the 
60th anniversary of the Liberation of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp. 
I call upon all Americans to observe this occasion with appropriate 
ceremonies and programs to honor the victims of Auschwitz and the 
Holocaust. May God bless their memory and their families, and may we 
always remember.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7866 of February 1, 2005

American Heart Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The miracles of modern medicine offer hope to those affected by heart 
disease, yet there are also simple measures that Americans can take to 
help prevent the disease. During American Heart Month, I encourage all 
Americans to take action to help reduce their risk and increase 
awareness of heart disease.
The steps to a healthy heart include preventing and controlling factors 
that can lead to heart disease--smoking, high blood pressure, high blood 
cholesterol, physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes. By avoiding 
tobacco, limiting consumption of alcohol, exercising regularly, eating a 
nutritious diet, and maintaining a healthy weight, Americans can 
substantially reduce their risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
I also urge citizens to get routine preventative screenings and consult 
with their doctors. Through these commonsense steps, we can save many of 
the lives we might otherwise lose each year to heart disease.
Although heart disease is often associated with men, it is the leading 
cause of death for American women: Nearly 500,000 American women die 
from cardiovascular disease each year. The National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute--part of the National Institutes of Health at the 
Department of Health and Human Services--and other national 
organizations have launched a national campaign called ``The Heart 
Truth'' to educate women about heart disease and to encourage them to 
make their health a priority. The symbol of ``The Heart Truth'' campaign 
is the red dress, which reminds women to talk with their doctors about 
heart disease and to make healthy choices. In addition, the American 
Heart Association has launched the ``Go Red For Women'' campaign to 
reach out to more women across our country. By continuing to raise 
public awareness about this deadly disease, we can help all our citizens 
lead healthier lives.
In recognition of the importance of the ongoing fight against heart 
disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963, 
as amended (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation designating February as 
``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 2005 as American Heart Month, and I 
invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day by wearing 
a red dress, shirt, or tie on February 4, 2005. I also invite the 
Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of 
other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the 
American people to join me in our continuing commitment to fighting 
heart disease.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7867 of February 1, 2005

Centennial of the Forest Service, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 2005, the Department of Agriculture's Forest Service celebrates a 
century of service to our Nation. After President Theodore Roosevelt 
established the Forest Service as part of the Department of Agriculture 
in 1905, Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson wrote to the First Chief 
of the Forest Service, Forester Gifford Pinchot, that ``all land is to 
be devoted to its most productive use for the permanent good of the 
whole people.'' The Forest Service has now upheld this noble charge for 
100 years, and America's forests remain vibrant because of the hard work 
and dedication of our foresters.
Beyond serving as places for recreation, our forests are also sources of 
paper products, building materials, chemicals, and many other resources 
that drive our economy. Over the last century, the Forest Service has 
combined this ethic of good stewardship with sound science and a spirit 
of innovation to cultivate and sustain our forests in ways that benefit 
our entire society.
Today, Americans continue to be responsible stewards of national forests 
and grasslands. Through the commonsense management approach of my 
Healthy Forests Initiative, the Forest Service is working with State and 
local governments, tribes, and other Federal agencies to help prevent 
destructive wildfires, return forests to a healthier, natural condition, 
and maintain a full range of forest types. The Forest Service is also 
providing important work, education, and job training to citizens in 
need. This commitment to ``Caring for the Land and Serving People'' 
contributes to our country's success in conserving our environment and 
ensuring that our natural resources remain sources of pride for our 
citizens, our communities, and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 1, 2005, as the 
Centennial of the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture. I 
call upon the people of the United States to recognize this anniversary 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in honor of the 
Forest Service's contributions to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7868 of February 7, 2005

National African American History Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our Nation's history, the contributions of African Americans 
have stirred our Nation's conscience and helped shape our character. 
During National African American History Month, we honor the 
determination and commitment of generations of African Americans in 
pursuing the promises of America.
The theme of National African American History Month this year, ``The 
Niagara Movement: Black Protest Reborn, 1905-2005,'' honors the 
grassroots movement of 1905 to 1910 that was organized to fight racial 
discrimination in America. Led by W.E.B. DuBois, the movement called for 
voting rights for African Americans, opposed school segregation, and 
worked to elect officials committed to fighting racial prejudice. 
Americans today carry on this movement as our Nation strives to live up 
to our founding principle that all of God's children are created equal.
It is important to teach our children about the heroes of the civil 
rights movement who, with courage and dignity, forced America to 
confront the central defect of our founding. Every American should know 
about the men and women whose determination and persistent eloquence 
forced people of all races to examine their hearts and revise our 
Nation's Constitution and laws. As we celebrate African American History 
Month, we remember how great the struggle for racial justice has been. 
And we renew our efforts to fight for equal rights for all Americans. We 
have made great progress, but our work is not done.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2005 as National 
African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate programs and activities that honor the history, 
accomplishments, and contributions of African Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7869 of February 7, 2005

National Consumer Protection Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year's National Consumer Protection Week focuses on the impact and 
problems caused by identity theft and on the steps Government is taking 
to safeguard personal information. Today, many Americans reveal personal 
information when making purchases, borrowing money, or opening a bank or 
credit card account. This information makes it convenient to conduct 
routine transactions, but consumers must take precautions to protect 
their names, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, and 
account numbers against fraud and theft.
As one of the highest impact financial crimes in our Nation, identity 
theft can undermine the basic trust on which our economy depends. 
Millions of Americans have had their identity stolen, costing them and 
our country's businesses billions of dollars. Identity theft can shake 
consumers' confidence, destroy a person's financial reputation, and 
damage lifelong efforts to build and maintain a good credit rating.
We are acting to protect citizens from these crimes and the grief and 
problems they cause. During the last 2 years, I have signed the Fair and 
Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, which makes it easier for 
consumers to detect and protect themselves from fraud, and the Identity 
Theft Penalty Enhancement Act, which strengthens the penalties for 
identity theft. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service are working with 
State and local officials to stop the criminal networks responsible for 
much of the identity theft in America. The Federal Trade Commission also 
trains local law enforcement in detecting and investigating identity 
theft, and they have set up the Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, which 
tracks complaints across the country and provides these records to 
prosecutors seeking to shut down those who steal our citizens' good 
names.
Consumers can learn to prevent identity theft by visiting the National 
Consumer Protection Week website, www.consumer.gov/ncpw. Working 
together, we can reduce this growing problem and protect the financial 
security of our citizens and our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 6 through 
February 12, 2005, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon 
government officials, industry leaders, and consumer advocates to 
provide citizens with information about identity theft and how they can 
be responsible consumers, and I encourage all citizens to take an active 
role in protecting their personal information.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
February, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7870 of February 9, 2005

To Modify Rules of Origin Under the North American Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (the ``NAFTA'') with respect to the 
United States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (the ``NAFTA Implementation Act''), incorporated in 
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (the ``HTS'') the 
tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to 
carry out the NAFTA.
2. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act provides rules for 
determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in 
the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for the tariff and 
other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA. Section 202(q) of the 
NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes the President to 
proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the rules of origin set out in the NAFTA 
and to proclaim modifications to such previously proclaimed rules of 
origin, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 
103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3313(a)).
3. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS set out in the 
Annex to this proclamation are appropriate. For goods of Mexico, I have 
decided that the effective date of the modifications shall be determined 
by the United States Trade Representative (USTR).
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``1974 Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the 
substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other Acts 
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the 
removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or 
other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including section 604 of the 1974 Act, 
section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act, and section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, do hereby proclaim:
    (1) In order to modify the rules of origin under the NAFTA, general 
note 12 to the HTS is modified as provided in the Annex to this 
proclamation.
    (2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (3) The modifications made by the Annex to this proclamation shall 
be effective with respect to goods of Canada that are entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2005. 
The modifications made by such Annex shall be effective with respect to 
goods of Mexico that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after a date that the USTR announces in the Federal 
Register.

Proclamation 7871 of February 28, 2005

  
American Red Cross Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans have a long history of rising to meet humanitarian challenges, 
and the American Red Cross is a leader in these efforts. Since 1881, the 
American Red Cross has met disaster with compassion and courage. During 
American Red Cross Month, we honor this dedication and reaffirm the 
importance of volunteering time and contributing resources to make our 
communities and the world better.
From offering blood drives and lifesaving courses to providing disaster 
relief services at home and abroad, American Red Cross employees and 
volunteers work countless hours to care for those in need and serve a 
cause greater than self. As a result of the recent tsunami in the Indian 
Ocean, over 150,000 lives were lost and many more were left homeless and 
without food and water. The American Red Cross swiftly dispatched relief 
workers to assist those affected, and to distribute supplies, counsel 
survivors, and help people return home.
Here at home, the American Red Cross helps support our troops by 
transmitting emergency messages to members of the Armed Forces and their 
families. In this past year, the Red Cross has also contributed 
significantly to relief efforts for hurricanes in Florida, flooding in 
Western Pennsylvania, wildfires in the Western United States, and 
mudslides in California. These good works provide hope and healing to 
those dealing with profound loss and demonstrate the character of the 
American Red Cross.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim March 2005 as American Red Cross Month. I 
commend the efforts of American Red Cross employees and volunteers, and 
I encourage all Americans to donate their time, energy, and talents to 
support this organization's humanitarian mission.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7872 of March 2, 2005

Women's History Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Women's History Month, we celebrate the achievements of our 
Nation's women. For generations, American women have helped build our 
great Nation through their leadership as writers, teachers, artists, 
politicians, doctors, and scientists, and in other professions. As 
mothers, daughters, and sisters, women have supported and strengthened 
American families and communities. Women are at the forefront of 
entrepreneurship in America, creating millions of new jobs and helping 
to build our Nation's economic prosperity.
We celebrate those who have broken down barriers for women, such as 
Jacqueline Cochran, who was the founder and director of the Women's Air 
Force Service Pilots during World War II and the first woman to break 
the sound barrier. Gerty Theresa Radnitz Cori was the first American 
woman to receive a Nobel Prize in the sciences, and her research 
significantly advanced the treatment of diabetes. In 1926, Olympic Gold 
Medalist Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to swim the English 
Channel. Marian Anderson, a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, 
opened doors in music as the first African American to perform with the 
New York Metropolitan Opera. Juliette Gordon Low encouraged community 
service and the physical, mental, and spiritual development of America's 
young women as founder of the Girl Scouts of the United States of 
America. As we work to advance freedom and peace and fight the war on 
terror, American women in uniform are serving at posts at home and 
across the world, taking great risks as they make our Nation more 
secure.
As we commemorate Women's History Month, I encourage all Americans to 
celebrate the extraordinary contributions and accomplishments of 
American women and to continue our progress in making our society more 
prosperous, just, and equal.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2005 as Women's 
History Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that 
honor the history, accomplishments, and contributions of American women.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of

Proclamation 7873 of March 4, 2005

Irish-American Heritage Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The story of the Irish in America is an important part of the history of 
our country. This month, we pay tribute to Americans of Irish descent 
who have shaped our Nation and influenced American life.
Long before the great wave of Irish immigration in the 1840s, people of 
Irish ancestry were defining and defending our Nation. Charles Thomson, 
an Irishman by birth, served as Secretary of the Continental Congress 
and helped design the Great Seal of the United States. Irish-born 
Commodore John Barry fought for our country's independence and later 
helped found the United States Navy.
Irish Americans have been leaders in our public life, and they have 
retained a proud reverence for their heritage. In June 1963, President 
John F. Kennedy spoke to the Parliament in Dublin and told the story of 
the Irish Brigade, a regiment that fought valiantly for the Union and 
suffered terrible losses during the Civil War. Two decades after 
President Kennedy's visit, President Ronald Reagan returned to his 
great-grandfather's hometown in County Tipperary, Ireland, and greeted 
the crowd in their own Irish language.
The industry, talent, and imagination of Irish Americans have enriched 
our commerce and our culture. Their strong record of public service has 
fortified our democracy. Their strong ties to family, faith, and 
community have strengthened our Nation's character. The Irish are a 
significant reason why Americans will always be proud to call ourselves 
a Nation of immigrants.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2005 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by celebrating the contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7874 of March 4, 2005

Save Your Vision Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Eye disease causes suffering, loss of productivity, and diminished 
quality of life for millions of Americans. During Save Your Vision Week, 
we raise

[[Page 33]]

awareness of eye disease and encourage all our citizens to take action 
to safeguard their eyesight.
As people age, they can develop conditions that affect eyesight, 
including cataracts, glaucoma, retinal disorders, dry eye, and low 
vision. Through regular eye exams, many of these problems can be 
detected and treated early, reducing the risk of vision loss. The 
National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), suggests five steps for all Americans to take to protect their 
eyesight: regular physical exams; a complete eye exam every 1 to 2 
years; a check of family history; immediate attention if you notice any 
loss of eyesight, eye pain, or other eye problems; and use of sunglasses 
and a hat to protect eyes from the damaging effects of ultraviolet rays.
My Administration is committed to helping Americans lead better, 
healthier lives. We have doubled funding for the NIH, helping the United 
States to stay on the leading edge of medical research and technological 
change. Through education, prevention, early detection, and further 
research into effective treatments for eye disease, we can bring hope 
and comfort to our citizens and help more Americans keep the precious 
gift of sight.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended 
(77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 138), has authorized and requested the 
President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as ``Save 
Your Vision Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 6 through March 12, 2005, as Save Your 
Vision Week. I encourage eye care professionals, teachers, the media, 
and public and private organizations dedicated to preserving eyesight to 
join in activities that will raise awareness of the measures all 
citizens can take to protect vision.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7875 of March 18, 2005

National Poison Prevention Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Poison Prevention Week reminds us that young children need 
constant close supervision by responsible adults to keep them safe. This 
week highlights the dangers of accidental poisonings, steps that can be 
taken to reduce risks, and what to do in case of an emergency.
Poison control centers receive approximately one million calls each year 
about children who have ingested dangerous medicines or chemicals they 
have found around their homes. Since the first National Poison 
Prevention

[[Page 34]]

Week 43 years ago, many deaths and injuries have been prevented through 
increased public awareness, the use of child-resistant packaging, and a 
national network of poison control centers. We must build on this 
progress by taking additional precautions to keep our children safe. All 
potentially hazardous products, including those encased in child-
resistant packaging, should be stored out of the reach of children. 
Parents can educate themselves about poisons and receive safety 
information by visiting the Poison Prevention Week Council website at 
www.poisonprevention.org. In case of an emergency, families should keep 
the toll-free number, 1-800-222-1222, on hand in order to reach the 
nearest Poison Control Center. By properly supervising children, taking 
preventive measures, and knowing what to do in an emergency, we can help 
protect our young people from the risks of accidental poisonings.
To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of accidental 
poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved September 26, 1961, as amended (75 Stat. 681), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 20 through March 26, 2005, as National 
Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week 
by participating in appropriate ceremonies and activities and by 
learning how to prevent poisonings among children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7876 of March 24, 2005

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Well before modern Greece gained her independence, the ancient Athenians 
adopted democratic principles that guided their society. These 
principles inspired our Founding Fathers to proclaim the imperative of 
self-government as they worked to build our great Nation. America's love 
for liberty has deep roots in the spirit of Greece. On Greek 
Independence Day, we celebrate our special ties of friendship, history, 
and shared values with Greece.
Our country has welcomed generations of Greek immigrants, and we are 
grateful for their talents, wisdom, and creativity. We honor the Greek 
spirit that values family and education, public service and faith. Greek 
Americans have made a mark in every field--enhancing our culture, 
enriching our commerce, and defending our freedom. Their strong record 
of public

[[Page 35]]

service has also strengthened our democracy, and their contributions 
have made America a better place.
As we address the challenges of the 21st century, the United States and 
Greece remain committed partners in the vital work of advancing freedom 
and democracy. Our two Nations are founded on shared ideals of liberty, 
and we are working together to advance those ideals across the world 
today.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2005, as Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-

Proclamation 7877 of March 31, 2005

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In proclaiming the first Victims' Rights Week in 1981, President Reagan 
said, ``it is time all of us paid greater heed to the plight of 
victims.'' Since then, America has made great progress in treating crime 
victims with greater respect, meeting their needs, and providing them 
with help, hope, and healing. Each year, during National Crime Victims' 
Rights Week, we remember those who have lost their lives in violent 
crimes. We also renew our commitment to address the needs of victims and 
their families and to build public awareness of crime victims' rights.
The violent crime rate is at its lowest point in three decades. We must 
remain steadfast in our efforts to make America safer for all citizens 
and fairer for victims of crime. The Department of Justice has received 
historic levels of funding for programs to protect women and prosecute 
criminals. Family Justice Centers are helping local communities provide 
comprehensive services to victims of domestic crime and their loved 
ones. State and local law enforcement officials are continuing to serve 
the public and assist victims of crime. I signed into law the Justice 
for All Act of 2004, which expands DNA testing and enhances the scope 
and enforceability of crime victims' rights.
As we work to combat crime and support victims, we must also ensure the 
fairness and effectiveness of our criminal justice system. All 50 States 
and the Federal Government have passed important legal protections for 
victims of violent crime, and more than half the States have amended 
their constitutions to guarantee rights for victims. My Administration 
continues to

[[Page 36]]

support the bipartisan Crime Victims' Rights Amendment to the 
Constitution, which would safeguard basic rights for victims regarding 
their safety, notification of public proceedings involving the crime, 
and claims of restitution.
Across our Nation, individuals and organizations--including faith-based 
and community groups--are dedicated to defending and securing the rights 
of crime victims and providing hope and healing to those who hurt. 
Together, their commitment and compassion help ensure that our legal 
system stands up for the rights of victims and that our communities step 
forward to lend a hand to people in need. During this week, we honor 
their extraordinary work and renew our pledge to protect the rights of 
crime victims.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 10 through April 16, 
2005, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I encourage all Americans 
to highlight and advance the cause of victims' rights in their 
communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of 
March, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation has a responsibility to build a safe and nurturing society so 
that our young people can realize their full potential. During National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our commitment to preventing 
child abuse and rededicate ourselves to working together to ensure that 
all children can have a bright and hopeful future.
Creating a protective environment for our young people requires the 
shared commitment of individuals, families, and faith-based and 
community organizations. Parents and family members are the first and 
most important influence in a child's life. A safe and stable family can 
provide children with a foundation of love and security that encourages 
positive growth and development. Federal, State, and local government 
officials can also improve the lives of our young people by doing all 
they can to keep children safe from harm.
Together, we can protect our future generations so that they can realize 
the opportunities of our Nation. By providing help and hope to our young 
people, we will build a better and more compassionate world for our 
children and grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2005 as National 
Child

[[Page 37]]

Abuse Prevention Month. I encourage all Americans to protect our 
children from abuse and neglect and to help ensure that every child can 
grow up in a secure and loving environment.

Proclamation 7879 of April 1, 2005

National Donate Life Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's health care system is the best in the world. We are blessed 
with skilled doctors and medical professionals, advances in technology, 
and countless organ, tissue, and bone marrow donors who help save lives. 
During National Donate Life Month, we continue to work to raise donation 
awareness, help people get the information they need to become donors, 
and recognize those who have chosen to donate.
Organ donors share the precious gift of life with others and demonstrate 
the compassionate spirit of our Nation. Most people are eligible to 
donate organs, tissue, or bone marrow. They can join the donor registry 
in their State, indicate donations on their driver's license, or 
complete and carry a donor card. Through these measures, Americans help 
others in need to live longer and healthier lives.
My Administration remains committed to increasing organ and tissue 
donation. Over the past 4 years, more than 10,500 organizations have 
joined the Department of Health and Human Services' ``Gift of Life 
Donation Initiative'' and made donation information available to their 
employees, associates, and members. My fiscal year 2006 budget proposal 
includes $23 million for donation and transplant services at HHS and an 
additional $23 million for the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry. 
These programs will help increase donation rates, treat patients in 
need, and strengthen efforts to find suitable bone marrow donors.
During National Donate Life Month, I join our citizens in honoring 
donors and their families. The generosity of these individuals reflects 
the great character of our country and sets a fine example for all 
Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2005 as National 
Donate Life Month. I urge health care professionals, volunteers, 
educators, government agencies, and private organizations to help raise 
awareness of the need for organ and tissue donors across our Nation.

Proclamation 7880 of April 1, 2005

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the time of our Nation's founding, members of our military have 
built a tradition of honorable and faithful service. As they fought to 
protect our security and defend our ideals, some endured the extreme 
hardship of enemy captivity. On National Former Prisoner of War 
Recognition Day, we remember those courageous individuals taken prisoner 
while defending our country, and we honor their extraordinary 
sacrifices.
America's former prisoners of war are among our Nation's bravest heroes. 
Under the worst conditions, they fought fiercely and served with honor, 
and they continue to inspire generations with their strength and 
perseverance. In serving our Nation, each demonstrated personal courage, 
love of country, and devotion to duty. Because of their sacrifices, and 
the selflessness and heroism of all who have served in our Armed Forces, 
millions of people now live in freedom, and America remains the greatest 
force for good on Earth. On this day, we honor their role in protecting 
our country and the liberty of mankind.
Today, our brave men and women in uniform carry on their legacy--
unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, and unmatched in decency. 
As we pursue victory in the war on terror, I join all Americans in 
expressing our deepest gratitude to every service member who has been a 
prisoner of war and to their families.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2005, as National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon the people of the 
United States to join me in remembering former American prisoners of war 
by honoring their sacrifices. I also call upon Federal, State, and local 
government officials and private organizations to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April,

at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of 
the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the 
United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on the 
day of his interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at 
half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, 
legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all 
military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

Proclamation 7882 of April 5, 2005

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Leaders across the Americas understand that the hope for peace in our 
world depends on the unity of free nations. Each year, the people of the 
United States observe Pan American Day and Pan American Week to honor 
our shared commitment to freedom, prosperity, and security. We are 
working with our partners in the Western Hemisphere to advance our 
common interests and values so that we can build a brighter future for 
our citizens.
The idea of regional solidarity and inter-American cooperation, first 
envisioned in 1826 by Simon Bolivar, became a reality in 1890 when the 
First International Conference of American States concluded its meetings 
in Washington, D.C. There, President Benjamin Harrison praised the 
efforts of the countries in attendance for their desire to work together 
as American States. Through the years, these efforts, shared values, and 
mutual respect have strengthened this partnership.
Across our hemisphere, social, economic, military, and political 
cooperation are widespread. Last year, trade officials of five Central 
American nations and the Dominican Republic signed the Central American-
Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement with the United States. I urge 
the Congress to ratify this agreement, which will eliminate tariffs and 
trade barriers and expand regional opportunities.

[[Page 40]]

My Administration remains committed to the Inter-American Democratic 
Charter to advance democracy and defend freedom across our region. Our 
Nation's continued support of democratic institutions, constitutional 
processes, and basic liberties gives hope and strength to those 
struggling in our hemisphere and around the world to preserve the rule 
of law and their God-given rights.
The democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere believe in the rights 
and dignity of every person, and we believe that liberty is worth 
defending. In the spirit of Pan American cooperation, we will continue 
to work to strengthen ties among our nations and further democracy, 
peace, and prosperity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2005, as Pan 
American Day and April 10 through April 16, 2005, as Pan American Week. 
I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the 
United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7883 of April 5, 2005

National D.A.R.E. Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across America, law enforcement officers, volunteers, parents, and 
teachers are helping to send the right message to our Nation's youth 
about illegal drugs and violence through the Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education (D.A.R.E.) Program. On National D.A.R.E. Day, we express our 
gratitude for the important work of these individuals and reaffirm our 
commitment to ensuring that every child has an opportunity for a bright 
and hopeful future.
For over two decades, D.A.R.E. programs have taught our Nation's young 
people about the dangers of drug use and encouraged them to lead 
productive, drug-free, and violence-free lives. Police officers and all 
those involved in D.A.R.E. help save lives by opening the lines of 
communication between law enforcement and our young people to better 
enable them to make the right choices. In a culture in which bad 
influences and temptations are all too present, these soldiers in the 
armies of compassion are fostering a culture of responsibility among 
young people.
My Administration will continue to stand with families and communities 
to combat the dangers of drugs and violence. In my State of the Union 
Address, I announced a new initiative called Helping America's Youth to 
help ensure a successful future for young Americans. Led by First Lady 
Laura

[[Page 41]]

Bush, this initiative is educating parents and communities on the 
importance of positive youth development and is supporting 
organizations, including faith-based and community groups, who are 
helping young people to overcome the risks they face. We also support 
random student drug testing as a prevention tool, and we are helping 
educate young people about the dangers of illicit drug use through the 
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign and Drug-Free Communities 
Program.
The decisions our children make today will affect their health and 
character for the rest of their lives. By giving them the tools they 
need to make the right choices, D.A.R.E. programs help prepare our 
Nation's young people for the promising future our Nation holds for each 
of them.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2005, as 
National D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon Americans, particularly our youth, to 
help fight drug use in our communities, and I urge our citizens to show 
their appreciation for the law enforcement officials, volunteers, 
teachers, health care professionals, and all those who dedicate 
themselves to helping our children avoid drugs and violence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April,

Proclamation 7884 of April 5, 2005

Cancer Control Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We are making great gains in the fight against cancer. Advances in 
prevention, early detection, and treatment are reducing cancer rates and 
increasing the likelihood of survival. Despite this progress, cancer 
remains the second leading cause of death in America. During Cancer 
Control Month, we continue to work to learn more about cancer prevention 
and detection, promote efforts to find better treatments and a cure, and 
support cancer patients, survivors, and their families.
A healthy lifestyle can lower the risk of developing certain types of 
cancer. This year, the Department of Health and Human Services released 
new Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005, which emphasize reducing 
caloric intake, eating healthy foods, and increasing physical activity. 
I encourage all Americans to follow these guidelines, to use sunscreen 
and limit exposure to the sun, and to avoid tobacco and alcohol abuse. I 
also urge citizens to talk with their doctors about their cancer risk 
and to get regular check-ups and preventive screenings. Detecting cancer 
early increases survival rates and saves lives.
There are nearly 9.8 million cancer survivors in the United States today 
because of advances in health care. Aggressive funding will lead 
scientists to

[[Page 42]]

earlier diagnoses and improved treatments for lung, colorectal, and 
other cancers. My Administration proposed more than $5.6 billion for 
cancer prevention, treatment, and research through the National 
Institutes of Health in my fiscal year 2006 budget. These funds will 
help scientists learn more about this devastating disease and offer new 
hope for countless Americans and their families.
As we observe this month, we honor cancer survivors for their inspiring 
examples of courage, steadfast strength, and willingness to share their 
stories and experiences with others. We recognize the families, friends, 
and loved ones who support and encourage those living with cancer. And 
we remain grateful to our scientists and medical professionals, who make 
America's health care system the best in the world. Together, we can 
help all our citizens live healthier, longer lives.
In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution (52 
Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 103) as amended, requesting the President to issue 
an annual proclamation declaring April as ``Cancer Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 2005 as Cancer Control Month. I 
encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit 
organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that 
raise awareness about how all Americans can prevent and control cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of

National Volunteer Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The great strength of our Nation is found in the hearts and souls of the 
American people. During National Volunteer Week, we recognize the 
millions of individuals who touch our lives as soldiers in America's 
armies of compassion. Our Nation's volunteers inspire us with their 
dedication, commitment, and efforts to build a more hopeful country for 
our citizens.
Americans take pride in the example of citizens who give their time and 
energy to care for the most vulnerable among us. In the past year, 
millions of volunteers have mentored children, provided shelter for the 
homeless, prepared for and responded to disasters, cared for the sick 
and elderly, fed the hungry, and performed other acts of kindness and 
community service. These selfless deeds have contributed to a culture of 
compassion and taught young people the importance of giving back to 
their communities.
My Administration is encouraging volunteer service through the USA 
Freedom Corps, and we have seen tremendous growth in the number of 
volunteers. Last year, over 64 million Americans offered their time as 
volunteers,

[[Page 43]]

an increase of nearly 5 million people since 2002. In the aftermath of 
the Indian Ocean tsunami, the world witnessed the compassion of our 
Nation as millions of our citizens donated generously to help the many 
people affected by the disaster. By participating in public service 
programs such as the Peace Corps, Senior Corps, AmeriCorps, and 
grassroots efforts such as Citizen Corps, our citizens are helping 
others. My Administration also supports faith-based and community groups 
whose volunteers bring hope and healing to those in need.
During National Volunteer Week, we thank those who volunteer to serve a 
cause greater than self, and I commend the more than 200,000 Americans 
who have earned the Volunteer Service Award from my Council on Service 
and Civic Participation. I urge all those who wish to get involved to 
visit the USA Freedom Corps website at www.usafreedomcorps.gov. By 
giving back to our communities, we can change America for the better one 
heart and one soul at a time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 17 through April 23, 
2005, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize 
and celebrate the important work that volunteers do every day across our 
country. I also encourage citizens to explore ways to help their 
neighbors and become involved in their communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-

Small Business Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's economy is the most prosperous in the world, and the small 
business sector is one of its great strengths. During Small Business 
Week, we honor small business owners and workers, and we reaffirm our 
commitment to keeping America the best place in the world to do 
business.
Our economy is strong and growing stronger. More Americans are working 
today than ever before. The unemployment rate is lower than the average 
rate of the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's. Homeownership is at a record 
high. Family incomes are rising. Small businesses are at the heart of 
this growth, creating most new private-sector jobs in our economy and 
helping our citizens succeed.
My Administration is committed to keeping small businesses vibrant and 
strong. We provided tax relief and streamlined tax reporting 
requirements for small businesses. We are working to reduce the burden 
of unnecessary regulation and excessive litigation. We are working to 
make health care

[[Page 44]]

more available and affordable. We are opening up markets for U.S. 
products through free trade agreements and by enforcing existing trade 
laws. And we have promoted a culture of ownership so that more people 
can own their own homes and start their own businesses.
As small business owners and employees add to the vitality of our 
economy, they also inspire others to realize the full promise of our 
Nation. I join all Americans in celebrating the entrepreneurial spirit 
and hard work of our small business owners and employees.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 24 through April 30, 
2005, as Small Business Week. I call upon all the people of the United 
States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs that celebrate the achievements of small business owners and 
their employees and encourage and foster the development of new small 
businesses.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7887 of April 15, 2005

National Park Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's system of national parks is dedicated to protecting our 
resources and preserving our cultural and natural treasures. During 
National Park Week, we celebrate these places and those who work to 
support and maintain them. This year's National Park Week theme, 
``National Parks: America's Gift to the World,'' reminds us that our 
country's parks serve as tributes to our Nation's history that are 
enjoyed by visitors from around the globe.
My Administration is dedicated to ensuring that our national parks 
remain a source of pride for our citizens, and we are expanding our 
ability to protect America's historical and natural wonders. By 
insisting upon management excellence, the National Park Service is 
ensuring that the most vital maintenance and conservation needs of our 
parks are met and that resources are spent where they are needed the 
most.
As we observe National Park Week, we recognize the vital contributions 
of National Park Service employees and volunteers. These dedicated men 
and women manage nearly 400 areas, covering more than 84 million acres 
in 49 states. Together with the 140,000 volunteers who donated over 5 
million hours to these sites last year, National Park Service employees 
ensure that our National Parks are safe and enjoyable places where 
visitors can experience America.

[[Page 45]]

America's national parks reflect our commitment to protect the land that 
God has entrusted to our care and to mark the milestones that have made 
us a better Nation. In being good stewards of these treasures, we 
maintain the legacy of our country for future generations.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 24, 
2005, as National Park Week. I call upon the people of the United States 
to join me in recognizing the importance of our national parks and to 
learn more about these places of beauty, their cultural and historical 
significance, and the many ways citizens can volunteer to protect and 
conserve these precious national resources.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7888 of April 19, 2005

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As we enjoy the great freedoms of our country, we are mindful of our 
obligation to pass on to our children the values that sustain our 
liberty and our democracy. On Education and Sharing Day, we reaffirm our 
commitment to teach young people the lessons they need to preserve and 
strengthen our Nation, and to reach as far as their vision and character 
can take them.
Education and Sharing Day honors the memory of Rabbi Menachem Mendel 
Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who established education and 
outreach centers that offer social services and humanitarian aid around 
the world. Commemorating his life and legacy teaches the next generation 
that a single life of conscience and purpose can touch and lift up many 
lives. By helping to heal a broken heart, surrounding a friend with 
love, feeding the hungry, or providing shelter for the homeless, we can 
change America for the better, one heart, one soul, and one conscience 
at a time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 20, 2005, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon all our citizens to 
dedicate their time and talents to help our rising generation grow into 
caring and responsible adults.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7889 of April 20, 2005

National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Physical fitness is vital to a healthy lifestyle. During National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we highlight the importance of 
integrating exercise into our daily routines and encourage all our 
citizens to live more active lives.
Physical fitness benefits both the body and the mind. Regular exercise, 
along with healthy eating habits, helps prevent serious health problems, 
improves productivity, and promotes better sleep and relaxation. 
Maintaining an active lifestyle reduces the risk of chronic diseases 
such as obesity, diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and certain cancers. 
Americans can improve their health and well-being by dedicating a small 
part of each day to physical activity.
As children grow, athletic activities teach them important life lessons 
and help prepare them for the opportunities ahead. Sports are a way for 
young Americans to meet new friends, discover the value of teamwork, 
discipline, and patience, and learn to win and lose with respect for 
others. From baseball to mountain biking to swimming, sports and 
physical activities can be a great chance to get outdoors and enjoy 
memorable experiences with family and friends.
Through the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, my 
Administration is promoting the incorporation of physical activity into 
daily life and the importance of a healthy lifestyle. The Council's 
website, www.fitness.gov, provides information on steps individuals can 
take to live better and more productive lives. Programs like ``The 
President's Challenge'' help individuals set fitness goals and work hard 
to achieve them.
I urge all Americans to set aside time to improve their health through 
physical fitness and sports, and I encourage individuals to help 
motivate their family and friends to get out and exercise. By 
contributing to a culture of health and well-being in America, citizens 
help demonstrate the strength and character of our great country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2005 as National 
Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United 
States to make daily physical activity a priority in their lives and to 
recognize the numerous benefits of an active lifestyle. I also call on 
all Americans to celebrate this month with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-

Proclamation 7890 of April 28, 2005

National Charter Schools Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Strong schools are the building blocks of a prosperous and hopeful 
country. To ensure that all our children receive the education they need 
to succeed, schools must be innovative, accountable, and committed to 
student achievement. The charter school movement was founded on these 
principles and has played an important role in expanding educational 
choices in America. This week, we highlight the importance of charter 
schools and recognize their contributions to American education.
Charter schools are unique because they are public schools operating 
under a contract from a public agency. In exchange for increased 
flexibility in teaching methods and curricula, these schools promise to 
meet strict accountability standards designed to improve student 
performance. Four hundred new charter schools opened in 32 states for 
the 2004-2005 school year, and there are nearly 3,400 charter schools 
serving almost one million children in America. These institutions have 
provided a valuable alternative to families throughout the country.
My Administration is committed to advancing public education in America. 
The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is bringing increased 
accountability to our schools. Test scores are rising, and the 
achievement gap for minority students is closing. Our continued strong 
commitment to this legislation is ensuring that parents have greater 
flexibility when deciding on how best to educate their children. To 
support and enhance school choice, I have proposed $219 million for 
Charter School Grants and $37 million for Credit Enhancement for Charter 
School Facilities. I have also called for $50 million in new funding for 
the Choice Incentive Fund to support development of innovative school-
choice programs.
We must continue to demand better results from our schools so that every 
high school diploma represents a significant level of educational 
achievement and all graduates are armed with the tools to succeed in the 
21st Century. I commend the teachers and administrators of charter 
schools and all educators who are providing innovative alternatives that 
prepare our children for a bright and successful future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1 through 7, 2005, as 
National Charter Schools Week. I call on parents of charter school 
students and all those involved with charter schools to share their 
success stories and help Americans learn more about the important work 
of these institutions.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7891 of April 29, 2005

Law Day, U.S.A., 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The American legal system helps preserve our constitutional principles 
and ensures justice for all our citizens. As we celebrate Law Day, we 
recognize our Nation's commitment to the rule of law and the rights and 
privileges that all Americans share.
President Eisenhower established Law Day in 1958 to pay tribute to our 
heritage of liberty, justice, and equality under the law. Each year on 
Law Day, we recognize our Nation's commitment to a fair legal system and 
to protecting the rights and freedoms we cherish.
The theme of this year's Law Day, ``The American Jury: We the People in 
Action,'' recognizes the imperative of self-government and the necessity 
of individuals' participation in the judicial process. By taking time 
away from their day-to-day responsibilities to serve on juries, 
Americans demonstrate their commitment to good citizenship and their 
willingness to uphold the laws of our Nation.
Since our founding, the jury has been a fundamental institution in 
American law and a pillar of our democracy. As we celebrate Law Day this 
year, we honor the continued role of the jury as a foundation of our 
legal system, and express our appreciation to all Americans who serve on 
juries.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 2005, as Law Day, U.S.A. I also encourage Americans to 
observe May 1 through May 7, 2005, as National Juror Appreciation Week. 
I call upon the people of the United States to acknowledge the 
importance of our Nation's legal and judicial systems with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities, and to display the flag of the United States 
in support of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
ninth.

Proclamation 7892 of April 29, 2005

Loyalty Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Generations of men and women have sacrificed to defend the basic 
principles of liberty upon which our Nation was founded. This spirit of 
selfless

[[Page 49]]

service helps keep America strong and free. On Loyalty Day, we join 
together to celebrate this bond that makes our country great.
For more than two centuries, our military has given us examples of 
courage and patriotism that make every American proud. Today, more than 
a million Americans are stationed around the world, taking great risks 
and making personal sacrifices to secure the blessings of liberty for 
our country and to spread peace and freedom. These brave men and women 
are unrelenting in battle and unwavering in loyalty. Their service 
exemplifies our Nation's ideals, and they have our gratitude and 
support.
Volunteer service is also a proud American value. Our Nation relies on 
compassionate souls who look after their neighbors and surround the lost 
with love. Through good works, we can extend the promise of our country 
into every home and neighborhood. This year, I announced a new 
initiative, Helping America's Youth, led by First Lady Laura Bush, to 
help young people overcome the challenges they may face and emphasize 
the importance of loving, caring adults in every child's life. By 
educating and preparing today's young people to be the leaders of 
tomorrow, we strengthen our country and pass on the liberties we cherish 
to rising generations.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529, as amended, has designated May 1 of 
each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' On Loyalty Day, we honor our great Nation 
and the people who help keep it safe and strong. I ask all Americans to 
join me in this day of celebration and in reaffirming our allegiance to 
our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2005, as Loyalty Day. I call upon all 
the people of the United States to join in support of this national 
observance, and to display the flag of the United States on Loyalty Day.

Proclamation 7893 of May 3, 2005

National Observance of the 60th Anniversary of the End of World War II, 
2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty years ago, the flags of freedom unfurled across Europe and Asia as 
victorious American and Allied troops brought World War II to an end. 
Freedom prevailed when millions were liberated from oppression and 
tyranny was replaced by democracy.
The years of World War II were a hard, heroic, and gallant time in the 
life of our country. When it mattered most, a generation of Americans 
showed the finest qualities of our Nation and of humanity. More than 16 
million

[[Page 50]]

Americans served during World War II, putting on the uniform of the 
Soldier, the Sailor, the Airman, the Marine, the Coast Guardsman, or the 
Merchant Mariner. They were the sons and daughters of a peaceful 
country, who gave the best years of their lives to the greatest mission 
our country ever accepted. They earned 464 Medals of Honor, and over 
400,000 made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom. Millions more supported 
the war effort at home--caring for the injured and working in factories 
to provide supplies to those fighting in distant places like Midway, 
Normandy, Iwo Jima, and Bastogne.
As the war drew to a close, Americans remained united in support of the 
vital cause of restoring the liberty of mankind. When the end of the war 
in Europe was announced on May 8, 1945, hundreds of people rushed to the 
White House to celebrate the triumph of freedom. President Harry Truman 
addressed the American people from the White House and said, ``For this 
victory, we join in offering our thanks to the Providence which has 
guided and sustained us through the dark days of adversity.'' In the 
following months, the war in the Pacific was won and a grateful Nation 
began welcoming home liberty's heroes. Many who had left America's farms 
and cities as young men and women returned as seasoned veterans ready to 
finish their education, start families, and assume leadership roles in 
their communities.
Today, as we wage the war on terror and work to extend peace and freedom 
around the world, our service men and women follow in the footsteps of 
our World War II veterans by upholding the noble tradition of duty, 
honor, and love of country. Like generations before them, America's 
Armed Forces are among the world's greatest forces for good, answering 
today's dangers and challenges with firm resolve. Their vital mission 
will help secure our Nation in a new century, and all Americans are 
grateful for their courage, devotion to duty, and sacrifice.

Proclamation 7894 of May 3, 2005

Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Millions of Americans proudly trace their ancestry to the many nations 
that make up Asia and the Pacific islands. For generations, Americans of 
Asian/Pacific heritage have strengthened our Nation through their 
achievements in all walks of life, including business, politics, 
education, community service, the arts, and science.
This month we honor Asian/Pacific Americans for their contributions to 
our Nation's growth and development and to the spread of freedom around 
the world. This year's theme, ``Liberty and Freedom for All,'' honors 
the sacrifices of Asian/Pacific Americans in the defense of freedom and 
democracy. We remember the bravery of soldiers of Asian/Pacific descent 
who have served in our military. These proud patriots stepped forward 
and fought for the security of our country and the peace of the world, 
and they

[[Page 51]]

will always hold a cherished place in our history. As we confront the 
challenges of the 21st century and fight the war on terror, Americans of 
Asian/Pacific descent continue to serve in the Armed Forces and are 
working to secure our homeland and promote peace and liberty around the 
world. Their dedication and patriotism uphold the highest ideals of our 
country.
To honor the achievements and contributions of Asian/Pacific Americans, 
the Congress by Public Law 102-450 as amended, has designated the month 
of May each year as ``Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 2005 as Asian/Pacific American Heritage 
Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more about 
the history of Asian/Pacific Americans and their many contributions to 
our Nation and to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.

Proclamation 7895 of May 3, 2005

Older Americans Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Older Americans teach us the timeless lessons of courage, sacrifice, and 
love. By sharing their wisdom and experience, they serve as role models 
for future generations. During Older Americans Month, we pay tribute to 
our senior citizens and their contributions to our Nation.
Our seniors deserve our greatest respect. Their example shows us how to 
persevere in the face of hardship, care for others in need, and take 
pride in our communities. Their patriotism, service, and leadership 
inspire Americans and shape the character and future of our country.
Millions of Americans are now living longer, more productive lives, and 
many are choosing to stay active in the workforce. Senior citizens are 
also giving their time and talents by volun teering in many ways--from 
mentoring youth and participating in environmental stewardship projects 
to serving the homeless and assisting in emergency preparedness. More 
than 500,000 senior citizens volunteer through Senior Corps, a network 
of programs that enables older Americans to meet the needs and 
challenges of their communities. Through the USA Freedom Corps and 
Senior Corps, older Americans are dedicating their time and energy to 
strengthening our Nation and serving a cause greater than themselves.
This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Older Americans Act of 1965, 
which was created to improve the welfare of our seniors. By treating 
older Americans with the dignity and respect they deserve, we honor 
their legacy and contributions to our Nation. Their guidance and love 
enrich our country and make America a better place for all.

[[Page 52]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2005 as Older 
Americans Month. I commend our senior citizens for their many 
contributions to our society. I also commend the network of Federal, 
State, local, and tribal organizations, service and health care 
providers, caregivers, and dedicated volunteers who work on behalf of 
our senior citizens. I encourage all Americans to honor their elders, to 
care for those in need, and to publicly reaffirm our Nation's commitment 
to older Americans this month and throughout the year.

Proclamation 7896 of May 3, 2005

National Day of Prayer, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since our Nation's earliest days, prayer has given strength and comfort 
to Americans of all faiths. Our Founding Fathers relied on their faith 
to guide them as they built our democracy. Today, we continue to be 
inspired by God's blessings, mercy, and boundless love. As we observe 
this National Day of Prayer, we humbly acknowledge our reliance on the 
Almighty, express our gratitude for His blessings, and seek His guidance 
in our daily lives.
Throughout our history, our Nation has turned to prayer for strength and 
guidance in times of challenge and uncertainty. The Continental 
Congress, meeting in 1775, asked the colonies to pray for wisdom in 
forming a new Nation. Throughout the Civil War, President Abraham 
Lincoln issued exhortations to prayer, calling upon the American people 
to humble themselves before their Maker and to serve all those in need. 
At the height of World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt led our 
citizens in prayer over the radio, asking for God to protect our sons in 
battle. Today, our Nation prays for those who serve bravely in the 
United States Armed Forces in difficult missions around the world, and 
we pray for their families.
Across our country, Americans turn daily to God in reverence. We ask Him 
to care for all those who suffer or feel helpless, knowing that God sees 
their needs and calls on us to meet them. As our first President wrote 
in 1790, ``May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness 
in our paths . . .''. As we face the challenges of our times, God's 
purpose continues to guide us, and we continue to trust in the goodness 
of His plans.
The Congress by Public Law 100-307, as amended, has called on our 
citizens to reaffirm the role of prayer in our society and to honor the 
freedom of religion by recognizing annually a ``National Day of 
Prayer.''

[[Page 53]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 5, 2005, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
ask the citizens of our Nation to give thanks, each according to his or 
her own faith, for the liberty and blessings we have received and for 
God's continued guidance and protection. I also urge all Americans to 
join in observing this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.

Proclamation 7897 of May 5, 2005

Mother's Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Mother's Day, we pay tribute to the extraordinary women whose 
guidance and unconditional love shape our lives and our future. 
Motherhood often allows little time for rest. As President Theodore 
Roosevelt said of the American mother in 1905, ``Upon her time and 
strength, demands are made not only every hour of the day but often 
every hour of the night.'' President Roosevelt's words ring as true 
today as they did 100 years ago.
The hard, perpetual work of motherhood shows us that a single soul can 
make a difference in a young person's future. As sources of hope, 
stability, and love, mothers teach young people to honor the values that 
sustain a free society. By raising children to be responsible citizens, 
mothers serve a cause larger than themselves and strengthen communities 
across our great Nation.
Mothers are tireless advocates for children. In our schools, mothers 
help to ensure that every child reaches his or her full potential. In 
our communities, they set an example by reaching out to those who are 
lost and offering love to those who hurt. A mother's caring presence 
helps children to resist peer pressure, focus on making the right 
choices, and realize their promise and potential.
In an hour of testing, one person can show the compassion and character 
of a whole country. In supporting their sons and daughters as they grow 
and learn, mothers bring care and hope into others' lives and make our 
Nation a more just, compassionate, and loving place.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914, as amended (38 
Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as 
``Mother's Day'' and has requested the President to call for its 
appropriate observance. It is my honor to do so. May God bless mothers 
across our great land on this special day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 8, 2005, as Mother's Day. I encourage

[[Page 54]]

all Americans to express their love, appreciation, and admiration to 
mothers for making a difference in the lives of their children, 
families, and communities. I also call upon citizens to observe this day 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May,

Jewish Heritage Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Jewish Heritage Week, we celebrate and honor Jewish Americans for 
their contributions to this country and for helping to shape our 
national character.
The story of the Jewish people reflects the triumph of faith, the 
importance of family, and the power of hope. Through inspiring stories 
of personal sacrifice and survival, the Jewish people have demonstrated 
unyielding trust in a loving God and enduring faith in human freedom.
America is stronger and more hopeful because of the industry, talent, 
and imagination of Jewish Americans from around the world. Their 
commitment to excellence in science, public service, law, athletics, 
literature, and countless other fields has enriched our Nation and 
enhanced our culture. Through strong ties to family and community, 
Jewish Americans reflect a compassionate spirit and set a positive 
example for others.
We are also grateful for their legacy of selfless service to our 
country. As our troops defend liberty and justice abroad, we recognize 
Jewish Americans who have answered the call to help keep our Nation 
secure and build a more peaceful world. Their personal courage, love of 
country, and devotion to duty are helping to bring freedom and hope to 
millions who had previously lived under tyranny.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 8 through May 15, 
2005, as Jewish Heritage Week. I urge all Americans to celebrate the 
contributions of Jewish Americans to our Nation and observe this week 
with appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 7899 of May 10, 2005

National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year from June through November, Americans living on the Eastern 
seaboard and along the Gulf of Mexico face an increased threat of 
hurricanes. These powerful storms can create severe flooding, cause 
power outages, and damage homes and businesses with their high winds, 
tornadoes, storm surges, and heavy rainfall. The effects of these storms 
can be devastating to families and cause lasting economic distress. 
During National Hurricane Preparedness Week, we call attention to the 
importance of planning ahead and securing our homes and property in 
advance of storms.
Last year, six hurricanes and three tropical storms hit the United 
States, causing the loss of dozens of lives and billions of dollars in 
damage. Across the United States, Americans responded to these natural 
disasters with extraordinary strength, compassion, and generosity. Many 
volunteers donated their time and talents to help with the cleanup, 
recovery, and rebuilding of communities devastated by the hurricanes and 
tropical storms.
To prepare for the 2005 hurricane season, I urge all our citizens to 
become aware of the dangers of hurricanes and tropical storms and to 
learn how to minimize their destructive effects. Our Nation's weather 
researchers and forecasters continue to improve the accuracy of 
hurricane warnings, enabling residents and visitors to prepare for 
storms. By working together, Federal, State, and local agencies, first 
responders, the news media, and private citizens can help save lives and 
diminish the damage caused by these natural disasters.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 
2005, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon government 
agencies, private organizations, schools, and the news media to share 
information about hurricane preparedness and response to help save lives 
and prevent property damage. I also call upon Americans living in 
hurricane-prone areas of our Nation to use this opportunity to learn 
more about protecting themselves against the effects of hurricanes and 
tropical storms.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7900 of May 12, 2005

World Trade Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Free and fair trade creates jobs, raises living standards, and lowers 
prices for families throughout America. It also strengthens our 
relationships with other countries, helping us to forge new partnerships 
based on a commitment to generate new prosperity and a better way of 
life for people in America and throughout the world. This year, as we 
mark the tenth anniversary of the World Trade Organization, World Trade 
Week provides an opportunity to recognize the many benefits of free and 
fair trade in strengthening economies and improving lives.
Because 95 percent of the world's population resides outside of our 
borders, trade creates opportunities for American farmers, small 
businesses, and manufacturers to sell their products to consumers across 
the world. Trade also raises up the world's poor, bringing hope to those 
in despair.
Millions of American jobs depend on exports, and my Administration is 
committed to opening markets around the world for American products. 
Since 2001, we have completed free trade agreements with 12 nations, 
representing a combined market of 124 million consumers for American 
products, goods, and services. These agreements will create millions of 
new consumers for America's farmers, manufacturers, and small business 
owners, and deepen our friendships with countries in other parts of the 
world.
As we open up new markets to trade, we must always ensure that American 
workers are treated fairly. Our workers can compete with anyone, 
anywhere, so long as the rules are fair. My Administration will continue 
to enforce trade agreements and insist upon a level playing field for 
America's workers.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 15 through May 21, 
2005, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this 
week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate 
the benefits of trade to our Nation and the global economy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7901 of May 13, 2005

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our Nation, the courageous men and women who protect our 
communities wear the uniform and badge with pride as they safeguard our 
families, homes, and communities. On Peace Officers Memorial Day and 
Police Week, we honor the memory of those heroes who have fallen in the 
line of duty and recognize all those who put themselves at risk in the 
fight against crime, violence, and terrorism.
More than 800,000 men and women serve as officers of the law in the 
United States. They serve in varying capacities, including as U.S. 
Marshals, county sheriffs, deputies, State patrolmen, municipal police, 
and Federal agents. They share the fundamental qualities of discipline, 
integrity, and courage. Since our Nation's founding, peace officers have 
upheld the rule of law and defended the innocent, and we are grateful to 
them and their families for all they do to strengthen our communities.
On Peace Officers Memorial Day, we pause to remember those who have made 
the ultimate sacrifice. These brave men and women accepted the 
responsibilities of a noble calling and were willing to face danger for 
our safety. By having their names engraved into the National Law 
Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C., and praying for their 
families, we honor the memory of these fallen heroes and show the 
respect of a grateful Nation.
During Police Week and throughout the year, I urge all Americans to 
support law enforcement officers in the fight against crime. Every 
citizen can assist his or her local police force to help make our 
communities safer. Successful Citizen Corps programs like Neighborhood 
Watch and Volunteers in Police Service are making a difference in the 
lives of others, one heart and one neighborhood at a time. Information 
about these and other volunteer programs can be obtained by visiting the 
Citizen Corps website at citizencorps.gov. By working together, we can 
continue to build a safer America.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended, (76 Stat. 
676), the Congress has authorized and requested the President to 
designate May 15 of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the 
week in which it falls as ``Police Week,'' and by Public Law 103-322, as 
amended, (36 U.S.C. 136), has directed that the flag be flown at half-
staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2005, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 15 through May 21, 2005, as Police Week. I call on all Americans 
to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I 
also call on Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of 
government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace 
Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the 
flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.

Proclamation 7902 of May 13, 2005

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We rely on the men and women of our transportation industry to ensure 
efficient, secure, and reliable travel for our citizens and to keep our 
economy growing. On National Defense Transportation Day and during 
National Transportation Week, we recognize those who maintain and 
support our transportation system.
Our transportation system is vital to our national security. It is used 
to deploy troops around the world and to deliver crucial equipment and 
supplies in the field. Each day Americans also rely on our 
transportation system to reach their travel destinations and to 
transport billions of tons of freight across our country. My 
Administration has taken important steps to protect our Nation's 
bridges, tunnels, highways, waterways, rail lines, pipelines, and 
airports to help keep our citizens safe and our economy running 
smoothly.
Transportation professionals keep our country moving and support our 
citizens as they conduct business, tour our great Nation, and reunite 
with family and friends. The strong work ethic and professionalism of 
transportation employees help increase efficiency and production across 
our Nation and advance American prosperity. Their efforts reflect the 
values that make our country strong and help ensure that our 
transportation infrastructure will continue to benefit Americans for 
generations to come.
To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry 
and who contribute to our Nation's well-being and defense, the Congress, 
by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), 
has designated the third Friday in May each year as ``National Defense 
Transportation Day,'' and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as 
amended (36 U.S.C. 133), declared that the week during which that Friday 
falls be designated as ``National Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 20, 2005, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 15 through May 21, 2005, as National 
Transportation Week. I encourage all Americans to learn how our modern 
transportation system contributes to the security of our citizens and 
the prosperity of our country and to celebrate these observances with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 7903 of May 19, 2005

National Safe Boating Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Recreational boating has grown into one of our Nation's most popular 
pastimes, and as the summer approaches, millions of Americans will enjoy 
our country's beautiful waters. During National Safe Boating Week, we 
highlight our Nation's commitment to making recreational boating safer.
The number of boating fatalities has decreased over the last decade. By 
promoting the use of appropriate safety measures, we can save more lives 
and further reduce the number of injuries caused by boating accidents. 
The U.S. Coast Guard and others recommend four guidelines for safe 
boating: wear properly fitted life jackets; get vessels checked for 
safety; never boat under the influence of alcohol or drugs; and get 
proper training about the safe operation of boats. By adhering to these 
simple suggestions, boaters can keep themselves and others safe as they 
enjoy our Nation's waterways.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ``National Safe 
Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2005, as National 
Safe Boating Week. I encourage the Governors of the 50 States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, to join in observing this week. I 
also urge all Americans to learn more about safe boating practices, wear 
life jackets, take advantage of boating safety programs throughout the 
year, and always engage in proper and responsible conduct while on the 
water.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7904 of May 19, 2005

National Maritime Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's merchant mariners make our Nation more secure and our economy 
stronger. Throughout our history, they have promoted commerce and 
protected our freedom. On National Maritime Day, we honor the dedicated 
service of the United States Merchant Marine.
Each year, the men and women of the U.S. maritime transportation system 
move more than 2 billion tons of cargo along our waterways and across 
the open seas. Many of the raw materials Americans purchase are 
transported by merchant vessels, and merchant mariners ship agricultural 
products and finished goods in and out of the United States every day.
Merchant mariners have also served in every conflict in our Nation's 
history. The U.S. Merchant Marine helps provide our Nation's Armed 
Forces with crucial supplies and equipment. These brave men and women 
demonstrate courage, love of country, and devotion to duty, and we 
especially honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense 
of our Nation. The United States is safer and the world is more peaceful 
because of the work of our merchant mariners, and we are grateful for 
their service.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 20, 1933, as amended, has 
designated May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day,'' and has 
authorized and requested that the President issue an annual proclamation 
calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2005, as National Maritime Day. I 
call upon the people of the United States to celebrate this observance 
and to display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their 
communities. I also request that all ships sailing under the American 
flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7905 of May 20, 2005

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Memorial Day, we honor the men and women in uniform who have given 
their lives in service to our Nation. When the stakes were highest,

[[Page 61]]

our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen answered the 
call of duty and made the ultimate sacrifice for the security of our 
country and the peace of the world.
Throughout our Nation's history, members of the Armed Forces have taken 
great risks to keep America strong and free. These proud patriots have 
defended the innocent, freed the oppressed, and helped spread the 
promise of liberty to all corners of the earth. In serving our Nation, 
they have been unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, and 
unmatched in decency. Because of their selfless courage, millions of 
people who once lived under tyranny now are free, and America is more 
secure.
On Memorial Day, we remember that this history of great achievement has 
been accompanied by great sacrifice. To secure our freedom, many heroic 
service members have given their lives. This year we mark the 60th 
anniversary of the end of World War II, and we remember the Americans 
who died on distant shores defending our Nation in that war. On Memorial 
Day and all year long, we pray for the families of the fallen and show 
our respect for the contributions these men and women have made to the 
story of freedom. Our grateful Nation honors their selfless service, and 
we acknowledge a debt that is beyond our power to repay.
In respect for their devotion to America, the Congress, by a joint 
resolution approved on May 11, 1950, as amended (64 Stat. 158), has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of 
the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for 
permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of 
the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 
106-579, has also designated the minute beginning at 3:00 p.m. local 
time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe the National 
Moment of Remembrance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 30, 2005, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each 
locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time to unite in prayer. I also 
ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. I urge the media to 
participate in these observances.
I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of 
government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on 
this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels 
throughout the United States, and in all areas under its jurisdiction 
and control. I also request the people of the United States to display 
the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon 
period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7906 of May 25, 2005

National Homeownership Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For millions of individuals and families, the American Dream starts with 
owning a home. When families move into a home of their own, they gain 
independence and confidence, and their faith in the future grows. The 
spread of ownership and opportunity helps give our citizens a vital 
stake in the future of America and the chance to realize the great 
promise of our country.
From the earliest days of our Nation, homeownership has embodied the 
core American values of individual freedom, personal responsibility, and 
self-reliance. A home provides children with a safe environment in which 
to grow and learn. A home is also a tangible asset that provides owners 
with borrowing power and allows our citizens to build wealth that they 
can pass on to their children and grandchildren.
The benefits of homeownership extend to our communities. Families who 
own their own homes have a strong interest in maintaining the value of 
their investments, the safety of their neighborhoods, and the quality of 
their schools. Homeownership is also a bedrock of the American economy, 
helping to increase jobs, boost demand for goods and services, and build 
prosperity.
More Americans than ever own their own homes, but we must continue to 
work hard so that every family has an opportunity to realize the 
American Dream. In 2002, I announced a goal to add 5.5 million new 
minority homeowners by the end of the decade. Since then, we have added 
2.3 million new minority households. My Administration has also set a 
goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the 
next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing 
tax credit and two mortgage programs--the Zero Downpayment mortgage and 
the Payment Incentives program--to help more families achieve 
homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and 
I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream 
Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of 
American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, 
tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and 
Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities 
and improving citizens' lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as National 
Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
recognizing the importance of homeownership.

Proclamation 7907 of June 1, 2005

Black Music Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Black Music Month, we pay tribute to a rich musical tradition and 
honor the many contributions African-American musicians, singers, and 
composers have made to the culture of our Nation and to the world. This 
powerful, moving, and soulful music speaks to every heart, lifting us in 
times of sorrow and helping us celebrate in times of joy.
Black music's origins are found in the work songs and spirituals that 
bore witness to the cruelty of bondage and the strength of faith. In the 
strains of those songs, we hear the voice of hope in the face of 
injustice. From those roots, black music has grown into a diverse 
collection of styles, and it continues to evolve today. Black music 
captures a part of the American spirit and continues to have a profound 
impact on our country.
This month is an opportunity to reflect upon the achievements of 
African-American artists and to look forward to the future. We remember 
Robert Johnson, Bessie Smith, Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, Ray 
Charles, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and countless others for their 
love of music and their pioneering and passionate spirit. We celebrate 
today's musicians who continue to build upon the rich and vital heritage 
of black music.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as Black Music 
Month. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the history of 
black music and to enjoy the great contributions of African-American 
musicians.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of

Proclamation 7908 of June 1, 2005

Great Outdoors Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During Great Outdoors Month, we celebrate our Nation's natural heritage, 
reaffirm our commitment to conserve our environment, and recognize the 
many volunteers who help maintain our natural spaces.
Americans are blessed by our country's expansive landscapes, diverse 
wildlife, and beautiful public lands. Outdoor recreation provides an 
opportunity to enjoy the splendor of our Nation's remarkable natural 
treasures and reminds us of our responsibility to be good stewards of 
the environment.
Across our great Nation, Americans are taking that responsibility 
seriously and volunteering to help keep our natural areas beautiful for 
future generations. I commend these citizens for helping to protect our 
public lands, and I encourage all Americans to do their part. The 
Department of the Interior's Take Pride in America website and the USA 
Freedom Corps website offer examples of ways to participate in 
environmental stewardship projects.
We have an obligation to protect the Earth, and my Administration is 
pursuing responsible initiatives to make our air cleaner, our water 
purer, and our land better protected. In doing so, we are demonstrating 
the important principle that environmental protection and economic 
prosperity are both vital parts of being good stewards in the land we 
call home. Through these and other efforts, we will continue to build a 
cleaner, safer, and healthier environment for all Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as Great 
Outdoors Month. I call on all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities and to enjoy safe outdoor 
recreational activities.

Proclamation 7909 of June 3, 2005

National Child's Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Children are the future of our country and America's next generation of 
leaders. All of us--parents, families, teachers, mentors, and community 
members--have a responsibility to children to honor and pass along the

[[Page 65]]

values that sustain a free society. By spending time with a young 
person, adults can help our Nation's youth to make the right choices. On 
National Child's Day, we underscore our commitment to supporting 
children and to helping them realize a bright and hopeful future.
Family is the most important influence in a child's life. Parents are 
teachers, disciplinarians, advisors, and role models. By providing hope 
and stability, parents help children to understand the consequences of 
their actions and to recognize that the decisions they make today can 
affect the rest of their lives. Through initiatives that promote healthy 
marriages, responsible fatherhood, and adoption and foster care 
programs, my Administration is helping to ensure that more young people 
have a foundation of love and support.
Teachers also make a real difference in children's lives. America's 
educators help our students build character and acquire the skills and 
knowledge they need to succeed as adults. My Administration is insisting 
upon accountability in our public schools. We want every child to have 
an opportunity to realize the great promise of our country.
By mentoring children and helping them to achieve their dreams, 
Americans can fill their own lives with greater purpose and help make 
our country a better place. Our children benefit from a sense of 
community, and each of us has the power to make a difference in a 
child's life. I have introduced the Helping America's Youth initiative, 
led by First Lady Laura Bush, so that every child can grow up with a 
caring adult in his or her life--whether that adult is a parent, a 
teacher, a coach, or a mentor. I encourage all Americans to volunteer 
their time and talents to benefit our Nation's youth.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 5, 2005, as National 
Child's Day, and I call upon citizens to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also urge all Americans to 
dedicate their time and talents toward helping our Nation's young people 
so that all children may reach as far as their vision and character can 
take them.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of

Proclamation 7910 of June 10, 2005

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than two centuries, the flag of the United States has been a 
symbol of hope and pride. The flag has inspired our citizens during 
times of conflict and comforted us during moments of sorrow and loss. On 
Flag Day

[[Page 66]]

and throughout National Flag Week, we celebrate the proud legacy of Old 
Glory and reflect on this enduring symbol of freedom.
On June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress passed a resolution 
stating that ``the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, 
alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a 
blue field.'' As States have been added to the Union, the flag has been 
modified to reflect their addition to our Nation. Today, the appearance 
of our flag is based on President Eisenhower's Executive Order of August 
21, 1959, to include a star for all 50 States together with 13 stripes 
representing the original 13 American colonies.
Generations of Americans in uniform have carried the Stars and Stripes 
into battle so that our citizens can live in freedom. Across the globe, 
a new generation of Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast 
Guardsmen has stepped forward to serve under our flag, defending America 
from our enemies. We are grateful to them and their families for 
defending our flag and the values of our great Nation.
On this Flag Day, we recall the rich history of Old Glory, and we 
remember our duty to carry our heritage of freedom into the future.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949, as amended (63 Stat. 492), 
designated June 14 of each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation calling for its observance and 
for the display of the flag of the United States on all Federal 
Government buildings. The Congress also requested, by joint resolution 
approved June 9, 1966, as amended (80 Stat. 194), that the President 
issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 
occurs as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all citizens of the 
United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2005, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 12, 2005, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
suitable places. I also call upon the people of the United States to 
observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through 
Independence Day, also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a 
time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings 
and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the 
Flag of the United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June, 
in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of 
the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.

Proclamation 7911 of June 16, 2005

Father's Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Being a father is a great responsibility and a great joy. From the 
moment their children are born, fathers face the daily tasks of being 
mentors, protectors, providers, and friends. Fathers take great pride in 
watching their children take their first steps, learn to read, and 
attend their first day of school. On Father's Day, our Nation honors 
fathers across America, and we express our deep gratitude for their 
selfless love and sacrifices.
Caring, decent, and hardworking fathers give much of themselves. By 
offering unconditional love and providing guidance and discipline, a 
father is a source of stability and one of the most important influences 
on his children. A father's example helps shape the character and values 
that his children will carry with them into adulthood, and the lessons 
he teaches remain with them for a lifetime. By encouraging his sons and 
daughters to set high standards, work hard, and make good decisions, a 
father shows his children that they can meet life's challenges and be 
good citizens.
Responsible fatherhood is essential to a compassionate society in which 
all children are surrounded by love and taught the importance of 
respect, honesty, and integrity. My Administration commends all those 
who are working to strengthen the bonds between fathers and their 
children.
On Father's Day and all year long, we honor our Nation's fathers and 
express our love and appreciation for them. We also honor the many proud 
fathers who are serving our country on the front lines of freedom. We 
are grateful for their service and sacrifice, and we pray for them and

of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 7912 of June 29, 2005

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of 
Preferences and Certain Rules of Origin Under the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Pursuant to section 502(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended 
(the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(1)), the President is authorized 
to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries for purposes 
of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
2. In Proclamation 6425 of April 29, 1992, the President suspended duty-
free treatment for certain eligible articles imported from India after 
considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 
Act (19 U.S.C. 2461, 2462(c)), in particular section 502(c)(5) of the 
1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(5)) on the extent to which India provides 
adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.
3. In Proclamation 6942 of October 17, 1996, the President suspended 
duty-free treatment for certain eligible articles imported from Pakistan 
because of insufficient progress on affording workers in that country 
internationally recognized worker rights.
4. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(a)(1)(A)), the President may designate articles as eligible for 
preferential tariff treatment under the GSP.
5. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary developing countries, except those 
designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or 
beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in section 
503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to 
competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment afforded 
under the GSP to eligible articles.
6. Section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(C)) 
provides that a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary 
developing country with respect to an eligible article may be 
redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such 
article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the 
competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act 
during the preceding calendar year.
7. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) 
provides that the President may disregard the competitive need 
limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any 
beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the 
imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
8. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(1)) 
and after giving great weight to the considerations in section 503(d)(2) 
of the

[[Page 69]]

1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), the President may, subject to the 
limitations set out in section 503(d)(4) (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(4)), waive 
the application of the competitive need limitations in section 
503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act with respect to any eligible article from 
any beneficiary developing country, if after receiving advice from the 
United States International Trade Commission (USITC), he determines that 
such waiver is in the national economic interest of the United States.
9. Section 507(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)) provides that in 
the case of an association of countries that is a free trade area or 
customs union, or that is contributing to a comprehensive regional 
economic integration among its members through appropriate means, the 
President may provide that all members of such association other than 
members that are barred from designation under section 502(b) of the 
1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)) shall be treated as one country for 
purposes of the GSP.
10. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462) and taking 
into account the factors set forth in section 502(c) of the 1974 Act, I 
have decided to designate Serbia and Montenegro as a beneficiary 
developing country for purposes of the GSP.
11. After a review of the current situation in India and taking into 
account the factors set out in section 502 of the 1974 Act, in 
particular section 502(c)(5), I have determined that India has made 
progress in providing adequate and effective protection of intellectual 
property rights. Accordingly, I have determined to terminate the 
suspension of India's duty-free treatment for certain articles under the 
GSP.
12. After a review of the current situation in Pakistan, I have 
determined that Pakistan has taken or is taking steps to afford workers 
in that country internationally recognized worker rights as provided in 
section 502(c)(7) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(7)). Accordingly, I 
have determined to restore Pakistan's eligibility for certain articles 
for preferential treatment under the GSP.
13. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the 1974 Act, and after 
receiving advice from the USITC in accordance with section 503(e) of the 
1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), I have determined to designate certain 
articles, some of which were previously designated under section 
503(a)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(a)(1)(B)), as eligible 
articles. In order to do so for certain articles, it is necessary to 
subdivide and amend the nomenclature of certain existing subheadings of 
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).
14. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that certain beneficiary countries have exported certain eligible 
articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need 
limitation in 2004, and I therefore terminate the duty-free treatment 
for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.
15. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, and subject to the 
considerations set forth in sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act, I 
redesignate certain countries as beneficiary developing countries with 
respect to certain eligible articles that previously had been imported 
in quantities exceeding the competitive need limitations of section 
503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act.
16. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)

[[Page 70]]

of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect to certain eligible 
articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.
17. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the 
advice of the USITC on whether any industries in the United States are 
likely to be adversely affected by such waivers, and I have determined, 
based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 
and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, and after giving great weight to the 
considerations in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act, that such waivers 
are in the national economic interest of the United States. Accordingly, 
I have determined that the competitive need limitations of section 
503(c)(2)(A) should be waived with respect to certain eligible articles 
from certain beneficiary developing countries.
18. Pursuant to section 507(2) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that 
currently qualifying members of the South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation (SAARC) should be treated as one country for purposes of the 
GSP.
19. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the United 
States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182) (the ``NAFTA Implementation 
Act'') incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of 
origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
20. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) 
provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United 
States originate in the territory of a NAFTA Party and thus are eligible 
for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA. Section 
202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes 
the President to proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the rules of origin set 
out in the NAFTA and to proclaim modifications to such previously 
proclaimed rules of origin, subject to the consultation and layover 
requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 
U.S.C. 3313(a)).
21. The United States and Canada have agreed to modifications to certain 
NAFTA rules of origin. Modifications to the NAFTA rules of origin set 
out in Proclamation 6641 are therefore necessary.
22. Section 1558 of the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections 
Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-429) (the ``Miscellaneous Trade Act'') 
amended section 213(b) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act 
(CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)) to exclude certain footwear from duty-free 
treatment under the CBERA and to provide duty-free treatment for certain 
other footwear that is the product of a designated beneficiary Caribbean 
Basin Trade Partnership Act country.
23. In order to implement the tariff treatment provided under section 
1558 of the Miscellaneous Trade Act, it is necessary to modify the HTS.
24. Section 7(c) of the AGOA Acceleration Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-
274) (the ``AGOA Acceleration Act'') amended section 112(b)(6) of the of 
the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) 
(AGOA) (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(6)) by adding ethnic printed fabrics to the 
list of textile and apparel goods of beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
countries that may be eligible for the preferential treatment described 
in section 112(a) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(a)).

[[Page 71]]

25. Section 2 of Executive Order 13191 of January 17, 2001, delegated 
the President's authority under section 112(b)(6) of the AGOA to the 
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (Committee), in 
consultation with the then-Commissioner, United States Customs Service, 
now the Commissioner, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection 
(Commissioner), to determine which, if any, particular textile and 
apparel goods of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries shall be 
treated as being hand loomed, handmade, or folklore articles. Executive 
Order 13191 further ordered the Commissioner to take actions directed by 
the Committee to carry out such determinations.
26. In order to implement section 7(c) of the AGOA Acceleration Act, it 
is necessary to modify Executive Order 13191.
27. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including title V and section 604 of the 
1974 Act, section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act, section 1558 of

Proclamation 7913 of July 15, 2005

Captive Nations Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America stands for freedom and supports those who are oppressed. During 
Captive Nations Week, we reaffirm our commitment to advancing democracy, 
defending liberty, and protecting human rights around the world.
When President Eisenhower issued the first Captive Nations Week 
proclamation in 1959, freedom was being denied by communist regimes in 
Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Millions were deprived of their rights 
to freely practice religion, assemble in public, and exercise freedom of 
speech. The Cold War and the captivity of millions of people in Central 
and Eastern Europe have since ended, and we have witnessed the rise of 
democratic governments in countries across the globe.
Building a free and peaceful world is the work of generations, and this 
work continues. America believes that freedom is God's gift to each man 
and woman in this world and that spreading freedom's blessings is the 
calling of our time. We are continuing to work to help spread liberty 
and democracy to people who have known fear and oppression. The gains in 
places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, and Georgia have been achieved 
through the courage, determination, and sacrifice of millions of men and 
women in those countries, with the assistance of the United States and 
other allies.
As a Nation forged from the ideals of freedom, justice, and human 
dignity, we will continue speaking out on behalf of oppressed people. We 
will support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in 
every nation. This young century will be liberty's century, and during 
Captive Nations Week, we pledge to advance the cause of liberty for all 
people.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week in July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 17 through July 23, 2005, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to reaffirm 
their commitment to all those seeking liberty, justice, and self-
determination.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.
GEORGE W. BUSH

Proclamation 7914 of July 21, 2005

Parents' Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Parents are role models for their children. With patience, sacrifice, 
and love, they teach their children life lessons and prepare them for 
the future. On Parents' Day, we express our gratitude for the hard work 
of parents throughout America and reaffirm our commitment to promoting a 
culture of responsible parenthood.
Mothers and fathers love their children unconditionally and make daily 
sacrifices to provide for them. Parents create a safe, nurturing 
environment in which their children can grow and learn. By instructing 
their children to make right choices, parents instill lifelong values 
and prepare their children for the challenges and opportunities ahead. 
Parents experience the great joy of watching their sons and daughters 
mature into responsible adults and good citizens.
On Parents' Day, we recognize the boundless love and generosity of all 
parents, including the foster and adoptive parents who demonstrate the 
compassionate spirit of America. We honor parents for their dedication 
to providing our Nation's children with the love and support they need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, as 
amended, do hereby proclaim Sunday, July 24, 2005, as Parents' Day. I 
encourage all Americans to express love, respect, and appreciation to 
parents across our Nation. I also call upon citizens to observe this day 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 7915 of July 26, 2005

Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On July 26, 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed into law the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This historic legislation 
provides a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination 
of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The ADA 
reflects our Nation's faith in the promise of all individuals and helps 
to ensure that our Nation's opportunities are more accessible to all.

[[Page 97]]

The ADA has been a great success in expanding opportunity for disabled 
Americans. By reducing barriers and changing perceptions, the ADA has 
increased participation in community life and given greater hope to 
millions of Americans.
Because of the ADA, individuals with disabilities are better able to 
develop skills for school, work, and independent living. Our Nation has 
more to do to further the goals of the ADA. Through the New Freedom 
Initiative, my Administration is building on the progress of the ADA to 
increase the use of technology and expand educational and employment 
opportunities. We are promoting the development and dissemination of 
assistive and universally designed technology. We have launched 
DisabilityInfo.gov, an online resource of programs and technology 
relevant to the daily lives of people with disabilities and their 
families, employers, service providers, and other community members. We 
also require electronic and information technologies used by the Federal 
Government to be accessible to people with disabilities. To ensure that 
no child with a disability is left behind, I have requested $11.1 
billion for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in my FY 
2006 budget--$4.7 billion above the FY 2001 level. The Department of 
Education is seeking new and effective ways for students with 
disabilities to learn. My Administration is also working to educate 
employers on ADA requirements and further assisting persons with 
disabilities by implementing the ``Ticket to Work'' program and 
strengthening training and employment services at One-Stop Career 
Centers. Through all of these efforts, we are helping individuals with 
disabilities have the opportunity to live and work with greater freedom.
On the 15th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, we 
celebrate the progress that has been made and reaffirm our commitment to 
fulfilling the ADA's mission of bringing greater hope and opportunity to 
our Nation's disabled Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2005, as a day in 
celebration of the 15th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act. I call on all Americans to celebrate the many contributions 
individuals with disabilities have made to our country, and I urge our 
citizens to fulfill the promise of the ADA to give all people the 
opportunity to live with dignity, work productively, and achieve their 
dreams.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.

Proclamation 7916 of August 5, 2005

40th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In America, we believe in the freedom of every individual. This freedom 
includes the ability to participate in one of the most cherished rights 
and fundamental responsibilities of citizenship: the right to vote. The 
Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped ensure that all citizens would have the 
opportunity to vote, regardless of race. As President Lyndon Johnson 
said when he signed the Act, ``Millions of Americans are denied the 
right to vote because of their color. This law will ensure them the 
right to vote. The wrong is one which no American, in his heart, can 
justify. The right is one which no American, true to our principles, can 
deny.'' As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of this historic act, we 
reaffirm this bedrock commitment to equality and justice for all.
America's history is a story of people working for freedom, justice, and 
equality. We have made great progress toward achieving these ideals. In 
the middle of the 20th century, the conscience of America was awakened 
by the struggles and the courage of those who overcame racial slurs, 
fire hoses, and burning crosses. Brave men and women held sit-ins at 
lunch counters, rode buses on Freedom Rides, and marched in our Nation's 
Capital and throughout our country to demand the full promise of the 
Declaration of Independence. The work of these courageous Americans led 
to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and we remember their heroism on this 
anniversary.
America is a stronger and better Nation because of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. As President Johnson said upon signing the Act, it is ``a 
triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any 
battlefield.'' The Act was a great step forward in the history of our 
Nation, and it remains essential as we continue our progress toward a 
society in which every person of every background can realize the 
American Dream.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
Laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 6, 2005, as a day 
of celebration in honor of the 40th Anniversary of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7917 of August 15, 2005

National Airborne Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans live in freedom because of the extraordinary bravery, 
sacrifice, and dedication to duty of the members of our Armed Forces. 
From the first official Army parachute jump 65 years ago, our country's 
Airborne troops have played a crucial role in the defense of our Nation 
and our liberty. On National Airborne Day, we pay special tribute to 
these courageous soldiers who served with honor and integrity.
On August 16, 1940, the successful first jump of the Army Parachute Test 
Platoon laid the foundation for a new and innovative method of combat 
that helped contribute to an Allied victory in World War II. These bold 
pioneers answered the call of duty and set an example for future 
generations to follow. Since the designation of the Army's first 
Airborne division, the 82nd Airborne, on August 15, 1942, our Airborne 
troops have performed with valor. The brave men and women of our 
Airborne forces have worked to defeat tyranny, advance the cause of 
liberty, and build a safer world.
Today a new generation of Airborne forces is fighting a war against an 
enemy that threatens the peace and stability of the world. At this 
critical time, Airborne forces of the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force 
are continuing the noble tradition of the first sky soldiers. Americans 
are grateful for the service of our Airborne forces and all our troops, 
and we are inspired by the strength and sacrifice of our military 
members and their families.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 16, 2005, as 
National Airborne Day. I encourage all Americans to honor those who have 
served in the Airborne forces, and I also call upon all citizens to 
observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7918 of August 25, 2005

Women's Equality Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was adopted, 
guaranteeing American women the right to vote. The passage of this 
amendment was the culmination of a long struggle that reached back to 
the

[[Page 100]]

founding of the country and was furthered by the 1848 women's rights 
convention in Seneca Falls, New York. By celebrating Women's Equality 
Day, we commemorate the adoption of this amendment and honor the 
visionary women who fought tirelessly for women's suffrage.
Led by women such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and 
Lucretia Mott, the suffragists stood up against injustice and persevered 
until, as Susan B. Anthony wrote, the handful who first took a stand for 
suffrage grew into an army. The efforts of these pioneers helped secure 
for American women the right to vote.
Since the adoption of the 19th Amendment, women have continued to make 
great contributions to our Nation. Women today are leaders in medicine, 
law, journalism, business, government, and other professions. They are 
doctors and mothers, teachers and lawyers, homemakers and pilots, 
artists and entrepreneurs. Women also are serving with great honor in 
our Armed Forces as we fight a war on terror and defend our freedoms. 
The hard work of American women is essential to the strength and 
vitality of our country.
One hundred and fifty-seven years after the Seneca Falls Convention, we 
continue to work so that all people can enjoy their God-given rights. 
This Women's Equality Day, as we celebrate the 85th anniversary of the 
19th Amendment, we honor the perseverance, leadership, and achievements 
of the suffragists and all of America's women, and we renew our 
commitment to equal justice and dignity for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 2005, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7919 of August 29, 2005

National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women 
in the United States. Each year, thousands of women are diagnosed with 
ovarian cancer, and thousands die from the disease. During National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we strive to raise awareness of ovarian 
cancer and promote early detection and treatment of this disease.
Early detection is essential to the successful treatment of ovarian 
cancer. The 5-year survival rate is higher than 90 percent for ovarian 
cancer patients whose disease is caught during the first stage of 
development. Most

[[Page 101]]

ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, however, 
because no reliable screening test exists for the disease. Because the 
early signs of ovarian cancer are easy to miss and often resemble the 
signs of other conditions, it is important for women to talk with their 
doctors about detection and be aware of the risk factors and symptoms of 
this cancer.
There is more we need to learn about how best to prevent, detect, and 
treat ovarian cancer. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is currently 
sponsoring a study on genetic and environmental factors that may 
increase the risk of ovarian cancer. In addition, the NCI is sponsoring 
clinical trials to explore new ways to screen for and detect ovarian 
cancer. Researchers are studying new treatment options, including 
biological therapies, anticancer drugs, vaccines, and other therapies to 
treat resistant forms of ovarian cancer. The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention will spend almost $4.6 million, and the Department of 
Defense's Ovarian Cancer Research Program will invest an estimated $10 
million.
As we observe National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize the 
courage and strength of women battling ovarian cancer, and of their 
families and friends who love and support them. Our Nation is grateful 
for the hard work and commitment of our dedicated researchers and 
medical professionals. With continued effort, we can raise awareness of 
ovarian cancer and find new ways to prevent and treat this deadly 
disease.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2005 as National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and all people of the United States to continue our Nation's 
strong commitment to preventing and treating ovarian cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7920 of August 29, 2005

National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
among American men. This year, thousands of men will be diagnosed with 
prostate cancer, and thousands will die from the disease. While great 
strides have been made in the battle against prostate cancer, we have 
more work to do. During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, we 
renew our commitment to fight prostate cancer by finding better ways to 
prevent, detect, and treat this deadly disease.
My Administration is committed to funding research for prevention and 
better treatments for prostate cancer. This year, the National 
Institutes of

[[Page 102]]

Health will invest an estimated $381 million in prostate cancer 
research, including $310 million at the National Cancer Institute. The 
Department of Defense's Prostate Cancer Research Program will spend an 
estimated $85 million, and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention will devote an estimated $14 million toward prostate cancer 
research. Scientists are examining risk factors to identify ways to 
prevent prostate cancer, and they are finding ways to detect this 
disease earlier, when it is easier to treat. In addition, newer 
treatments are helping to slow or stop the spread of prostate cancer in 
men with advanced stages of the disease. This progress offers hope to 
men who are living with prostate cancer and those who are at risk.
As we observe National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, I encourage all 
men, especially those over the age of 50, to talk with their doctors 
about the risk of prostate cancer and the appropriate screenings. I 
commend those who fight this disease, and I applaud the dedication of 
researchers, health care providers, and all who are working to increase 
our knowledge of prostate cancer. By raising awareness and supporting 
research, we can save lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2005 as National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and all people of the United States to reaffirm our Nation's 
strong and continuing commitment to treat and prevent prostate cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 7921 of August 29, 2005

National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The devastating effects of alcohol and drug addiction have destroyed the 
lives and families of countless Americans. During National Alcohol and 
Drug Addiction Recovery Month, we recognize the dangers of substance 
abuse and renew the hope of overcoming addiction for individuals across 
our Nation. This year's theme, ``Join the Voices for Recovery: Healing 
Lives, Families and Communities,'' encourages those striving to recover 
from this disease and recognizes the many families, support 
organizations, faith-based and community groups, and volunteers working 
to help overcome addiction.
Substance abuse leads to a cycle of addiction and despair that too often 
causes disease and death among young people. The Helping America's Youth 
initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, is promoting positive youth 
development and combating alcohol and drug addiction. This initiative is

[[Page 103]]

helping our children to make healthy choices and build lives of purpose. 
To aid citizens seeking treatment and recovery for substance abuse, my 
Administration also has provided $200 million over the past 2 years for 
the Access to Recovery program. My 2006 budget requests an additional 
$150 million for this program to further expand treatment choices. 
Directing resources to individuals allows them to choose a program that 
suits their needs and increases their chances of success. In addition, 
we have increased opportunities for communities and faith-based 
providers to aid those suffering from addiction.
I encourage all Americans to support individuals striving to overcome 
addiction and the groups that are helping to fight alcohol and drug 
addiction. By working together, we can continue to build a more 
compassionate society that transforms lives and provides health, hope, 
and healing to those who hurt.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2005 as National 
Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month. I call upon the people of the 
United States to observe this month with appropriate programs and 
activities.

Proclamation 7924 of September 8, 2005

To Suspend Subchapter IV of Chapter 31 of Title 40, United States Code, 
Within a Limited Geographic Area in Response to the National Emergency 
Caused by Hurricane Katrina

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Section 3142(a) of title 40, United States Code, provides that 
``every contract in excess of $2,000, to which the Federal Government or 
the District of Columbia is a party, for construction, alteration, or 
repair, including painting and decorating, of public buildings and 
public works of the Government or the District of Columbia that are 
located in a State or the District of Columbia and which requires or 
involves the employment of mechanics or laborers shall contain a 
provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes or 
laborers and mechanics.''
2. Section 3142(b) of title 40, United States Code, provides that such 
``minimum wages shall be based on the wages the Secretary of Labor 
determines to be prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers 
and mechanics employed on projects of a character similar to the 
contract work in the civil subdivision of the State in which the work is 
to be performed . . .''
3. Under various other related acts, the payment of wages is made 
dependent upon determinations by the Secretary of Labor under section 
3142 of title 40, United States Code.

[[Page 105]]

4. Section 3147 of title 40, United States Code, provides that ``[t]he 
President may suspend the provisions of this subchapter during a 
national emergency.''
5. Several areas of the Nation have been recently devastated by 
Hurricane Katrina. The devastation from the hurricane has resulted in 
the largest amount of property damage from a natural disaster in the 
history of the Nation. An enormous but undetermined number of lives have 
been lost, and hundreds of thousands of homes and business 
establishments either destroyed or severely damaged. Hundreds of 
thousands of individuals have lost their jobs and their livelihood. An 
unprecedented amount of Federal assistance will be needed to restore the 
communities that have been ravaged by the hurricane. Accordingly, I find 
that the conditions caused by Hurricane Katrina constitute a ``national 
emergency'' within the meaning of section 3147 of title 40, United 
States Code.
                                                                     (a)
     Hurricane Katrina has resulted in unprecedented property damage.
                                                                     (b)
     The wage rates imposed by section 3142 of title 40, United States 
    Code, increase the cost to the Federal Government of providing 
    Federal assistance to these areas.
                                                                     (c)
     Suspension of the subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United 
    States Code, 40 U.S.C. 3141-3148, and the operation of related acts 
    to the extent they depend upon the Secretary of Labor's 
    determinations under section 3142 of title 40, United States Code, 
    will result in greater assistance to these devastated communities 
    and will permit the employment of thousands of additional 
    individuals.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do by this proclamation suspend, as to all contracts entered 
into on or after the date of this proclamation and until otherwise 
provided, the provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, 
United States Code, 40 U.S.C. 3141-3148, and the provisions of all other

Proclamation 7925 of September 8, 2005

National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims of Hurricane 
Katrina

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst natural disasters in our Nation's 
history and has caused unimaginable devastation and heartbreak 
throughout the Gulf Coast Region. A vast coastline of towns and 
communities has been decimated. Many lives have been lost, and hundreds 
of thousands of our fellow Americans are suffering great hardship. To 
honor the memory of those who lost their lives, to provide comfort and 
strength to the families of the victims, and to help ease the burden of 
the survivors, I call upon all Americans to pray to Almighty God and to 
perform acts of service.
As we observe a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims 
of Hurricane Katrina, we pledge our support for those who have been 
injured and for the communities that are struggling to rebuild. We offer 
thanks to God for the goodness and generosity of so many Americans who 
have come together to provide relief and bring hope to fellow citizens 
in need. Our Nation is united in compassion for the victims and in 
resolve to overcome the tremendous loss that has come to America. We 
will strive together in this effort, and we will prevail through 
perseverance and prayer.
Americans are reaching out to those who suffer by opening their hearts, 
homes, and communities. Their actions demonstrate the greatest 
compassion one person may show to another: to love your neighbor as 
yourself. Across our Nation, so many selfless deeds reflect the promise 
of the Scripture: ``For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty 
and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in.'' I 
encourage all Americans to respond with acts of kindness in the days 
ahead. By contributing time,

[[Page 107]]

money, or needed goods to a relief organization and by praying for the 
survivors and those in recovery efforts, we can make a tremendous 
difference in the lives of those in need.
Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath resulted in a considerable loss of 
life. We pray that God will bless the souls of the lost, and that He 
will comfort their families and friends and all lives touched by this 
disaster. As the American people unite to help those who are hurting, we 
share a determination to stand by those affected by Hurricane Katrina in 
the months and years ahead as they rebuild their lives and reclaim their 
future. We are determined that the Gulf Coast region will rise again. 
The tasks before us are enormous, and so is the heart of America. We 
will continue to comfort and care for the survivors. We will once again 
show the world that the worst adversities bring out the best in the 
American people.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 16, 
2005, as a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance for the Victims of 
Hurricane Katrina. I ask that the people of the United States and places 
of worship mark this National Day of Prayer and Remembrance with 
memorial services and other appropriate observances. I also encourage 
all Americans to remember those who have suffered in the disaster by 
offering prayers and giving their hearts and homes for those who now, 
more than ever, need our compassion and our support.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7926 of September 9, 2005

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across our country, the entrepreneurial spirit of minority businesses is 
strong and growing. By creating jobs and advancing opportunities, these 
businesses improve lives and transform neighborhoods throughout our 
Nation. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we recognize 
minority entrepreneurs and their employees for their commitment to free 
enterprise and equal opportunity.
Minority businesses are an essential part of a society in which personal 
initiative is encouraged and in which opportunity is within the reach of 
all of our citizens. Significant increases in minority business 
ownership are providing an engine for economic growth and helping more 
of our citizens succeed. By fueling job creation and providing goods and 
services to consumers, these businesses are helping to lift communities 
and provide hope.

[[Page 108]]

In order to extend the promise of our country to all of our citizens, 
our economy must continue to grow and expand. My Administration is 
working to keep taxes low, protect small businesses from needless 
regulation and frivolous lawsuits, and reduce global trade barriers to 
open up new markets for American entrepreneurs. We have provided new 
market tax credits to boost investment and community development in low-
income areas, and we are working to stimulate and support minority 
businesses by providing training and mentoring.
Minority businesses help ensure that our country is a land of 
opportunity. Their example reflects the best qualities of America, 
demonstrating that every person has the opportunity to strive for a 
better future and to take part in the promise of our great Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 11 through 
September 17, 2005, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon 
all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities to recognize the important contributions of 
our Nation's minority enterprises.

Proclamation 7927 of September 9, 2005

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities are places of 
learning and achievement that reflect our Nation's belief in the great 
potential of every student. By upholding high standards of excellence 
and providing equal educational opportunities to all Americans, these 
valued institutions help ensure that all our citizens can realize their 
full potential and look forward to a prosperous and hopeful future.
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are a source of 
accomplishment and great pride for the African-American community and 
our entire Nation. By fostering academic achievement, instilling strong 
values and character, and equipping students with a quality education, 
they prepare rising generations for success and help fulfill our 
country's commitment to equal education.
My Administration is committed to supporting HBCUs and making higher 
education more affordable and more accessible. To ensure that more 
students have access to a college or university education, I have 
requested

[[Page 109]]

nearly $300 million for HBCUs in my 2006 budget, a record level of 
funding that would represent an increase in spending for these 
institutions by 30 percent during my Administration. Through the White 
House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, we are 
pursuing new ways to strengthen and advance HBCUs through endowments, 
faculty development, and cooperative research.
America has made significant progress in strengthening our higher 
education system for all our citizens, and there is more work to do. We 
continue to strive toward a society in which every person can realize 
the great promise of America. During National Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities Week, we recognize the contributions of HBCUs, 
and we acknowledge and celebrate their role in making America a stronger 
and better Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 11 through 
September 17, 2005, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities Week. I call on public officials, educators, 
administrators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities 
that demonstrate our appreciation for the many contributions these 
valuable institutions and their graduates have made to our country.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the

Proclamation 7928 of September 9, 2005

National Days of Prayer and Remembrance, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans will always remember the terrible events and violent cruelty 
of September 11, 2001. We will always honor the many innocent lives that 
were lost, and we will never forget the heroism of passengers, first 
responders, and others on that day. During this year's National Days of 
Prayer and Remembrance, we pay tribute to the memory of those taken from 
us in the terrorist attacks in New York, in Pennsylvania, and at the 
Pentagon. We pray for the families left behind who continue to inspire 
us through their steadfast character, courage, and determination.
In the time since September 11, 2001, Americans have come together to 
defend America and advance freedom. We are grateful to our brave men and 
women in uniform who are making daily sacrifices at home and at posts 
around the globe, and we pray for their safety as they defend our 
liberty. In the war on terror, we have lost good men and women who left 
our shores to protect our way of life and did not live to make the 
journey home. We honor their memories, and we pray for their families.

[[Page 110]]

The war that began for America on September 11, 2001, continues to call 
on the courage of our men and women in uniform and the perseverance of 
our citizens. The past 4 years have brought many challenges and 
sacrifices, yet we have much reason to be thankful and hopeful about the 
future. America has become more secure as terrorists have been brought 
to justice, two of the most brutal and aggressive regimes have ended, 
and freedom has spread in the Middle East and around the world. In the 
months and years ahead, we will continue to defend our freedom and lay 
the foundations of peace for our children and grandchildren.
During these Days of Prayer and Remembrance, we give thanks to the 
Almighty for our freedom, and we acknowledge our dependence on the Giver 
of this gift. Four years after September 11, 2001, we remember the lives 
lost and pray for God's continued blessings on their families and our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Friday, September 9, 
through Sunday, September 11, 2005, as National Days of Prayer and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States and places of 
worship mark these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance with memorial 
services and other appropriate ceremonies.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7929 of September 9, 2005

Patriot Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Four years have passed since our country was brutally attacked on a 
quiet September morning. On that day, thousands of innocent lives were 
taken from us. The victims and the families who lost loved ones remain 
in the hearts and prayers of our Nation. We also remember the courage of 
the firefighters, police officers, emergency rescue personnel, and 
scores of private citizens who showed us the true meaning of heroism and 
demonstrated our resolve to the world.
The mission that began on September 11, 2001, continues. Today, we see 
the virtue of the September 11th heroes embodied in our military 
personnel, who are taking the fight to our enemies and helping to keep 
us safe at home. Thousands of other Americans, from intelligence 
analysts to border guards to countless others, are doing vital work to 
help defend America and prevent future attacks. We are grateful to all 
of these men and women and to their families for their service and 
sacrifice. We honor those who have lost their lives defending our 
freedom, and we pray that God comfort their families. We pledge that we 
will not rest until we have won the war on terror.

[[Page 111]]

As we mark this solemn anniversary, I call upon all our citizens to 
express their patriotism and their gratitude for the blessings of 
liberty. By flying the flag, supporting military families, and teaching 
young people about our founding ideals, we honor the lives lost on 
September 11, 2001, and since, and we help preserve our freedom for 
future generations.
By a joint resolution approved December 18, 2001 (Public Law 107-89), 
the Congress has designated September 11 of each year as ``Patriot 
Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 11, 2005, as Patriot Day. I call 
upon the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico, as well as appropriate officials of all units of government, to 
direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Patriot Day. I call upon 
the people of the United States to observe Patriot Day with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities, including remembrance services, to display 
the flag at half-staff from their homes on that day, and to observe a 
moment of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor 
the innocent victims who lost their lives as a result of the terrorist 
attacks of September 11, 2001.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In every generation, members of our Armed Forces have answered the call 
of service in our Nation's hour of need. These patriots have defended 
our freedom and way of life, triumphed over brutal enemies, and answered 
the prayers of millions. On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor 
the Americans who have been prisoners of war and recognize them for 
enduring unimaginable hardships while serving in military conflicts 
around the globe. We also remember those who are still missing in 
action, and we renew our commitment to keep searching until we have 
accounted for every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, and Marine missing in the 
line of duty.
On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, the flag of the National League of 
Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia is flown 
over the White House, the Capitol, the Departments of State, Defense, 
and Veterans Affairs, the Selective Service System Headquarters, the 
National Vietnam Veterans and Korean War Veterans Memorials, U.S. 
Military Installations, national cemeteries, and other locations across 
our country. The flag is a reminder of our continued commitment to those 
brave patriots imprisoned while serving in conflicts around the world 
and of our pledge to continue to achieve the fullest possible accounting 
for all our men and women in uniform who are still missing. Americans 
are blessed with the

[[Page 112]]

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, our entire Nation honors and pays 
special tribute to our prisoners of war and those who remain missing.

Proclamation 7931 of September 16, 2005

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, America has been a land of diversity and has 
benefitted from the contributions of people of different backgrounds 
brought together by a love of liberty. During National Hispanic Heritage 
Month, we celebrate the achievements of Hispanic Americans and the 
significant role they have played in making our Nation strong, 
prosperous, and free.
The contributions of Hispanic Americans have made a positive impact on 
every part of our society. Americans of Hispanic descent are astronauts 
and athletes, doctors and teachers, lawyers and scientists. The vibrancy 
of our Nation's Hispanic performers enriches music, dancing, and the 
arts. Hispanic Americans serve at every level of government, including 
as Attorney General of the United States and Secretary of Commerce. 
Latino entrepreneurs are starting and growing businesses all across 
America, creating jobs and opportunities. The hard work and 
determination of Hispanic Americans continue to inspire all those who 
dream of a better life for themselves and their families.
Our Nation's Hispanic community has contributed to the advance of 
freedom abroad and to the defense of freedom at home. In every 
generation, Hispanic Americans have served valiantly in the United 
States military. Today there are more than 200,000 Hispanic Americans 
serving in the Armed Forces, and our Nation is grateful for their 
courage and sacrifice. In addition, thousands of Hispanic Americans are 
helping to defend and protect our homeland by serving as police officers 
and firefighters. All Americans are thankful for their daily work in 
helping to keep our Nation safe.
During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we join together to recognize 
the proud history and rich culture of Hispanic Americans. To honor the

[[Page 113]]

achievements of Hispanic Americans, the Congress, by Public Law 100-402, 
as amended, has authorized and requested the President to issue annually 
a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as ``National 
Hispanic Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 2005, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, 
educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to 
observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

Proclamation 7932 of September 16, 2005

Constitution Day and Citizenship Day, Constitution Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than two centuries after our Founding Fathers gathered in 1787 in 
Philadelphia, our Nation continues to be guided by the Constitution they 
drafted.
The Constitution of the United States reflects our ideals and 
establishes a practical system of government. It provides for three 
separate branches--the legislative, the executive, and the judicial--
with defined responsibilities and with checks and balances among the 
branches. Under our Constitution, both the Federal Government and the 
State governments advance the will of the people through the people's 
representatives. To protect the rights of our citizens and maintain the 
rule of law, Article III of the Constitution provides for a judiciary of 
independent judges who have life tenure.
These fundamental principles--separation of powers, federalism, and an 
independent judiciary--have endured, and they have been essential to our 
Nation's progress toward equal justice and liberty for all. On 
Constitution Day and Citizenship Day and during Constitution Week, we 
celebrate the genius of our Constitution and reaffirm our commitment to 
its stated purposes: ``to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, 
insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the 
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and 
our Posterity.''
In remembrance of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of 
citizenship, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 
U.S.C. 106, as amended), designated September 17 as ``Constitution Day 
and Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 
U.S.C. 108, as

[[Page 114]]

amended), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning 
September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 2005, as Constitution Day and 
Citizenship Day, and September 17 through September 23, 2005, as 
Constitution Week. I encourage Federal, State, and local officials, as 
well as leaders of civic, social, and educational organizations, to 
conduct ceremonies and programs that celebrate our Constitution and 
reaffirm our rights and obligations as citizens of our great Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7933 of September 16, 2005

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As stewards of our natural resources, farmers and ranchers play a 
crucial role in keeping our Nation strong. This year's theme for 
National Farm Safety and Health Week, ``Harvesting Safety and Health,'' 
encourages those in the agriculture industry to practice and promote 
safe working conditions and reminds all Americans of the vital 
contributions of farmers and ranchers to our country.
Our farming communities embody the American values of hard work, faith, 
love of family, and love of country. Their skill and dedication feed, 
clothe, and provide energy for Americans and others around the world.
Agricultural workers face one of the most hazardous work environments in 
America. Farmers and ranchers operate heavy machinery, work in inclement 
weather, and tend livestock. Because of these risks, taking safety 
precautions is vital for agricultural workers. By implementing 
preventive measures and increasing our knowledge of first aid, we can 
greatly reduce many hazards of farm and ranch labor. Utilizing safety 
features and keeping children from working or playing in potentially 
hazardous areas also can limit injuries and help farmers and ranchers 
protect their families.
Our farmers and ranchers help keep our Nation strong and advance the 
opportunities that come from freedom. During National Farm Safety and 
Health Week, we recognize the significant contributions of farmers and 
ranchers to our Nation and encourage the further development of work 
environments that will ensure their safety.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through 
September 24, 2005, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
the agencies, organizations, and businesses that serve America's 
agricultural

[[Page 115]]

workers to continue strengthening their commitment to promoting farm 
safety and health programs. I also urge all Americans to recognize the 
men and women cultivating our land who contribute to the vitality and 
prosperity of our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7934 of September 16, 2005

Family Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Families are a source of hope, stability, and love. On Family Day, we 
celebrate the special bonds that link children and parents, and we 
recognize the importance of parental involvement in the lives of their 
children. By providing guidance, support, and unconditional love, 
families help shape the character and future of our Nation.
In a free and compassionate society, the public good depends upon the 
private character of our citizens. That character is formed and shaped 
from a child's earliest days through the love and guidance of family. 
Families help children understand the difference between right and wrong 
and the importance of making good choices. Regular family activities 
allow parents to be actively involved in the lives of their children and 
instill important values of honesty, compassion, and respect for others. 
By raising young people in a loving and secure environment, parents help 
them develop into successful adults and responsible citizens.
Parents and family are a bedrock of love and support, and my 
Administration is committed to strengthening families. My 2006 budget 
proposes $240 million for initiatives that promote responsible 
fatherhood and encourage healthy marriages. Through competitive grants 
to State-based programs and faith-based and community organizations, we 
are helping support their good work. As parents continue to raise 
healthy children, we can all help young people realize a bright and 
promising future.
Strong families are the cornerstone of a strong America, and the well-
being of families is a shared priority for all Americans. As we support 
families, we help build a Nation of opportunity and hope.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 26, 2005, as 
Family Day. I call on the people of the United States to observe this 
day by spending time with family members and reaffirming the important 
relationship between parents and children and the vital role that 
families play in our society.

Proclamation 7935 of September 21, 2005

Gold Star Mother's Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The men and women of America's Armed Forces selflessly serve to protect 
our Nation, and they are among our greatest heroes. From the trenches of 
World War I to the beaches of Normandy, from Korea to Vietnam, from 
Afghanistan to Iraq, many courageous members of our military have given 
their lives so that Americans could live in freedom and security. On 
Gold Star Mother's Day, we recognize and pray for the devoted and 
patriotic mothers of these men and women in uniform who have made the 
ultimate sacrifice in defense of our liberty.
America's Gold Star Mothers carry a great burden of grief, yet they show 
a tremendous spirit of generosity in helping their fellow citizens. With 
kindness and understanding, they support members of our Armed Forces and 
their families, provide vital services to veterans, help to educate 
young people about good citizenship and our Nation's founding ideals, 
and bring comfort to many in need. We commend these proud women for 
their compassion, commitment, and patriotism, and our Nation will always 
honor them for their sacrifice and service.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1895 as amended), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold 
Star Mother's Day'' and has authorized and requested the President to 
issue a proclamation in its observance. On this day, we express our deep 
gratitude to our Nation's Gold Star Mothers, and we ask God's blessings 
on them and on their families.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 25, 2005, as Gold Star 
Mother's Day. I call upon all Government officials to display the flag 
of the United States over Government buildings on this solemn day. I 
also encourage the American people to display the flag and hold 
appropriate ceremonies as a public expression of our Nation's sympathy 
and respect for our Gold Star Mothers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7936 of September 30, 2005

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Breast cancer is the second most common kind of cancer and the second 
leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States. During 
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we renew our commitment to 
making progress in the fight to prevent, detect, treat, and cure this 
deadly disease.
Although we do not yet know the exact causes of breast cancer, 
researchers have discovered several factors that can increase a person's 
risk of developing the disease, including age, characteristics of 
certain genes, and a family history of breast cancer. It is important 
for individuals to seek medical advice about risk factors and screening 
methods.
Because treatment is more likely to be successful when breast cancer is 
detected early, regular screening is vital. The National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) and the United States Preventive Services Task Force 
recommend that women age 40 and over have a mammogram every 1 to 2 
years. Women with an increased risk of breast cancer should talk to 
their doctors about getting mammograms even before the age of 40. To 
increase awareness about the importance of regular screening, the NCI's 
Cancer Information Service Partnership Program collaborates with 
nonprofit, private, and government agencies across the country to 
provide information to people most in need.
America leads the world in medical research, and we are committed to 
continuing progress in the search for a cure for breast cancer. The 
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the NCI are 
conducting research into genetic and environmental factors that may 
increase breast cancer risk. The NCI is also sponsoring one of the 
largest studies ever conducted on breast cancer prevention, enrolling 
more than 19,000 women. This year alone, the National Institutes of 
Health, the CDC, and the Department of Defense will collectively spend 
more than $850 million on breast cancer research.
This month, we recognize breast cancer survivors, those battling the 
disease, and the family members and friends who are a tireless source of 
love and encouragement for these individuals. Their courage, hope, and 
faith are an inspiration to all of us. We appreciate the efforts of 
medical professionals and researchers who work to find a cure for this 
deadly disease, and I urge all Americans to talk with friends and loved 
ones about the importance of breast cancer screening and early 
detection. By working together, we can raise awareness and help people 
live longer and healthier lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2005 as National 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and

[[Page 118]]

all the people of the United States to continue our Nation's strong 
commitment to preventing and treating breast cancer and to finding a 
cure for this disease.

Proclamation 7937 of September 30, 2005

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across America, individuals with disabilities are making important 
contributions in the workplace. This month, we celebrate their 
accomplishments and reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that the 
opportunities of America are available and accessible to every citizen.
Fifteen years ago, President George H. W. Bush signed into law the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), reducing barriers for 
millions of Americans with disabilities and providing a mandate for the 
elimination of discrimination in the workplace and in the community. 
Since the ADA was enacted, people with disabilities have been able to 
participate more fully in the workforce, and our Nation has become 
stronger and more just. Yet more work remains, and we continue our 
efforts to enable Americans with disabilities to live and work with 
greater freedom.
In the spirit of the ADA, my Administration's New Freedom Initiative has 
expanded access to assistive technologies, education, and opportunities 
for people with disabilities to integrate into the workforce. I signed 
into law legislation that improves the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act to ensure that our young people with disabilities are 
prepared for the many opportunities ahead. Through these and other 
efforts, we are working to ensure that Americans with disabilities can 
realize the promise of America.
To recognize the contributions of Americans with disabilities and to 
encourage all citizens to ensure equal opportunity in the workforce, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved as amended (36 U.S.C. 121), has 
designated October of each year as ``National Disability Employment 
Awareness Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 2005 as National Disability 
Employment Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, labor 
leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7938 of September 30, 2005

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Domestic violence is a great evil and an offense against human dignity 
that shatters lives and robs children of their innocence. Where it 
occurs, homes are transformed into places of danger and despair. During 
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we renew our commitment to 
preventing domestic violence.
We are making progress in the fight against violence in the home. Over 
the past decade, the domestic violence rate has declined by an estimated 
59 percent. But much work remains to be done. My Administration remains 
committed to preventing domestic abuse by supporting victims and 
punishing offenders. We have secured historic levels of funding for the 
Violence Against Women programs at the Department of Justice, presided 
over an increase in Federal prosecutions for crimes of violence against 
women, and implemented a program to help fund transitional housing for 
victims fleeing domestic abuse.
To increase access to comprehensive support and services for victims of 
domestic violence, in 2003 I announced the creation of the Family 
Justice Center Initiative. These centers bring together police officers, 
attorneys, counselors, doctors, victims' advocates, chaplains, and 
others so that domestic violence victims can more easily find the help 
and support they need. The Department of Justice has awarded over $20 
million to support the creation of 15 Family Justice Centers across the 
country, and several of these centers have already opened their doors 
and are making a difference in victims' lives.
Faith-based and community organizations are also making vital 
contributions in the effort to combat domestic violence. These 
organizations are fostering an environment where victims can step out of 
the shadows and get the help and care they need. Through initiatives 
like the Faith-Based and Community Organization Rural Pilot Program and 
the Safe and Bright Futures for Children Initiative, the Departments of 
Justice and Health and Human Services are providing funding to support 
these organizations in their life-changing work.
I appreciate all those who work to end domestic violence and to protect 
vulnerable members of our society. By working together, we continue to 
build a society that respects the life and dignity of every person.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2005 as National 
Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I urge all Americans to reach out to 
help victims of domestic violence and help to make ending domestic 
violence a national priority.

Proclamation 7939 of September 30, 2005

Child Health Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Children are a precious gift, and we have a responsibility to help them 
realize a hopeful and promising future. On Child Health Day, we 
underscore the importance of healthy and active lifestyles for our 
Nation's young people, and we reaffirm our commitment to helping them 
use their gifts to work toward a successful future.
We have high aspirations for all our Nation's children. Parents play the 
central role in ensuring the health and well-being of their children and 
in creating a safe and nurturing environment. Schools, communities, and 
government leaders can support the work of parents by helping to build a 
society based on the fundamental values of respect, honesty, self-
restraint, fairness, and compassion. We must all continue to promote a 
culture of responsibility in which families and communities teach young 
people to understand that their decisions affect their health now and in 
the future.
My Administration remains committed to giving parents, teachers, 
mentors, and communities the resources they need to help children avoid 
drugs, alcohol, violence, early sexual activity, and other dangerous 
behaviors. Through the Helping America's Youth initiative, led by First 
Lady Laura Bush, we are helping children to overcome the challenges they 
may face so they can lead healthy lives and realize their full 
potential.
Young people are America's future leaders, and we can all work to 
instill the values that sustain a free society. On this day and 
throughout the year, I urge our citizens to give their time and talents 
to benefit our Nation's youth.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in 
October as ``Child Health Day'' and has requested the President to issue 
a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 3, 2005, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon families, schools, child health professionals, faith-
based and community organizations, and governments to help all our 
children discover the rewards of good health and wellness.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of

Americans of German descent have made to our great Nation.
Among the early German immigrants, many saw America as a beacon of 
religious freedom and an opportunity for an improved standard of living. 
German immigrants helped pioneer the first American colony at Jamestown. 
Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg served as the first Speaker of the House 
of Representatives; in this role, he certified the final version of the 
Bill of Rights.
Throughout our country's history, men and women of German descent have 
worn the uniform of the United States military to defend our country's 
freedom. Among these were Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief of 
the United States Pacific Fleet during World War II, and General Dwight 
D. Eisenhower, who went on to become one of America's Presidents of 
German ancestry. Today, German-American troops continue to serve proudly 
in our Nation's Armed Forces.
German Americans have enriched many other aspects of American life. 
Albert Einstein's advancements in the field of physics help define our 
understanding of the universe. Theodor Seuss Geisel, more commonly known 
as Dr. Seuss, has captivated the imaginations of children for 
generations with his timeless classics. Baseball great Lou Gehrig's 
courage on and off the field continues to inspire the American spirit 
more than 60 years after his death.
On German-American Day, we also honor the important friendship between 
the United States and Germany. Our nations share beliefs in human rights 
and dignity, and on this day, I join all Americans in celebrating the 
bonds that tie our two nations and in reaffirming the importance of our 
continuing friendship.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2005, as 
German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to celebrate the many 
contributions German Americans have made to our Nation's liberty and 
prosperity.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7941 of October 7, 2005

Fire Prevention Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year, fires kill or injure thousands of Americans and destroy or 
damage billions of dollars worth of property. Many of these fires might 
have been prevented by taking appropriate precautions and following 
safety guidelines. During Fire Prevention Week, we highlight the need to 
prevent and prepare for fires, and we raise awareness of fire safety. We 
also honor our Nation's brave firefighters.
Each year, the National Fire Protection Association and the Department 
of Homeland Security's United States Fire Administration raise awareness 
during Fire Prevention Week. This year's theme is ``Use Candles with 
Care.'' Although the number of home fires has declined in recent years, 
the number of fires caused by candles has risen dramatically. 
Fortunately, the risk of candle fires can be lessened by following a few 
basic guidelines, including never leaving candles unattended, keeping 
them away from flammable items, and always keeping them out of reach of 
children.
While many fires can be prevented by following precautions, families 
should still be prepared for the possibility of a fire by having working 
smoke alarms on every level of their homes. Families should also have a 
fire escape plan in place to help get everyone out of the home safely in 
case of an emergency.
When fires occur, Americans depend on our courageous firefighters to be 
first on the scene and to save lives. Each year, more than 100 of our 
country's firefighters die in the line of duty. Americans are grateful 
for the brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way to rescue 
and protect their fellow citizens. During Fire Prevention Week, we 
recognize these heroes and honor their sacrifice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 9 through October 
15, 2005, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 9, 2005, in 
accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be 
flown at half-staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the 
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I invite the people of 
the United States to participate in this observance by flying our 
Nation's flag over their homes at half-staff on this day, to mark this 
week with appropriate programs and activities, and to renew efforts 
throughout the year to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7942 of October 7, 2005

National School Lunch Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since 1946, the National School Lunch Program has contributed to the 
welfare of our Nation's youth and the academic mission of our schools. 
Each year during National School Lunch Week, we recognize this valuable 
program and highlight the continuing importance of providing America's 
children with access to nutritious meals.
Today, nearly 100,000 public and private schools and residential child 
care institutions are implementing the National School Lunch Program, 
providing fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, and other nutritious food 
choices to an average of 29 million children each school day. The School 
Breakfast Program and the availability of after-school snacks as part of 
the School Lunch Program give children additional opportunities to 
receive a more wholesome diet.
Through the National School Lunch Program, school officials and food 
service professionals continue to demonstrate their dedication to our 
Nation's youth. To support these efforts, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Team Nutrition provides important nutrition education 
programs for children and technical training programs for food service 
professionals to assist them in preparing healthy school lunches. The 
National School Lunch Program also supports the HealthierUS School 
Challenge, an initiative that recognizes schools and local communities 
for actively promoting healthy lifestyles. By encouraging healthy eating 
habits and access to nutritious food, we are helping America's young 
people succeed in school, and we are helping protect them against 
childhood obesity, diabetes, and the risk of other serious health 
problems later in life.
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch Program 
to the health, education, and well-being of America's children, the 
Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), as 
amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in 
October of each year as ``National School Lunch Week,'' and has 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9 through October 15, 2005, as 
National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join the 
dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch Program 
in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being of our 
Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7943 of October 7, 2005

Leif Erikson Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

More than 1,000 years ago, Leif Erikson left the coast of Greenland and 
began a journey to explore new lands. He made that voyage in the spirit 
of discovery and became one of the first Europeans known to have reached 
North America, inspiring stories of bountiful lands and charting a way 
for future explorers to follow. On Leif Erikson Day, we celebrate the 
accomplishments of Leif Erikson and his crew, and we honor the many 
contributions of Nordic Americans to our Nation.
The journey of Leif Erikson reflects the spirit that has made America 
strong, as the desire to explore and understand is part of our national 
character. Today, we continue to push the frontiers of knowledge in many 
areas and especially with our exploration of space, drawn to the heavens 
as we were once drawn to the open seas.
Generations of Nordic Americans have come to our country with a sense of 
determination and optimism, and they have helped build a stronger and 
more vibrant Nation. On Leif Erikson Day, we celebrate Nordic Americans, 
as well as the ties between America and the Nordic nations. We are 
joined by a common respect for liberty, human rights, and the dignity of 
every person. Working together, we are spreading freedom and hope, and 
we are helping to build a better and more compassionate world.
To honor Leif Erikson, son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, and to 
celebrate our citizens of Nordic-American heritage, the Congress, by 
joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 2, 1964, has 
authorized and requested the President to proclaim October 9 of each 
year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2005, as Leif Erikson Day. I call 
upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.

October, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7944 of October 7, 2005

Columbus Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Christopher Columbus' journey across uncharted waters in 1492 changed 
the course of history. Overcoming many obstacles, the explorer from 
Genoa

[[Page 125]]

pursued a dream that carried him to the ``New World'' and helped launch 
an age of exploration, leading to the founding of new countries across 
the Americas. Through the years, the desire to discover and understand 
has been a part of our Nation's character, and Columbus' spirit has 
inspired generations of explorers and inventors. On Columbus Day, we 
honor Christopher Columbus and the vision that carried him on his 
historic voyage.
Since 1934, when President Roosevelt first proclaimed the national 
holiday, our Nation has observed Columbus Day to mark the moment when 
the Old World met the New. As we recognize Columbus' legacy, we also 
celebrate the contributions of Italian Americans to our Nation's growth 
and well-being. Americans of Italian descent are musicians and athletes, 
doctors and lawyers, teachers and first responders. They are serving 
bravely in our Armed Forces. From our country's first days, the sons and 
daughters of Italy have brought honor to themselves and enriched our 
national life.
More than 500 years after Columbus' journey, we are honored that the 
Italian Republic is among our closest friends and strongest allies. On 
Columbus Day, we celebrate this strong bond between America and Italy.
In commemoration of Columbus' journey, the Congress, by joint resolution 
of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has 
requested that the President proclaim the second Monday of October of 
each year as ``Columbus Day.''
 NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 10, 2005, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7945 of October 7, 2005

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's freedom has been achieved with great sacrifice. In the 
Revolutionary War, General Casimir Pulaski gave his life for the cause 
of freedom. Today, we honor his selfless contributions and heroic 
service.
Born in Poland, Casimir Pulaski fought Russian oppression in his 
homeland. In 1776, Benjamin Franklin met Pulaski in France and 
successfully recruited him to join the American fight for liberty. In 
America, Pulaski distinguished himself at the Battle of Brandywine and 
was commissioned as a Brigadier General by General George Washington. 
After raising his own legion, a special infantry and cavalry division 
that included many foreign-

[[Page 126]]

born troops, he helped defend Charleston, South Carolina, before being 
mortally wounded at the siege of Savannah in 1779.
General Pulaski exemplifies the spirit and determination of Polish 
immigrants to America, and he embodies our Nation's highest ideals. On 
this day, we express our gratitude for all the contributions of Polish 
Americans to our Nation and for the strong relationship between the 
United States and Poland. By honoring this lasting friendship and 
remembering heroes like General Pulaski, we reaffirm our commitment to 
advancing our country's founding ideals and carry forward our heritage 
of freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2005, as 
General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage Americans to commemorate this 
occasion with appropriate programs and activities honoring Casimir 
Pulaski and all those who defend freedom.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 7946 of October 14, 2005

National Character Counts Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Character Counts Week, we focus on ways to reach out to 
our fellow Americans, especially children. Parents are the first and 
best example of character in a child's life. By volunteering and 
performing other acts of service in their communities, parents can teach 
children about the good that comes from helping others. By extending a 
hand to those who suffer, parents can demonstrate kindness and 
compassion and help children learn the importance of serving a cause 
greater than themselves.
Our schools also play a vital part in providing children with the 
principles they need to grow and succeed. The Department of Education 
supports character education through its Partnerships in Character 
Education Program. During my Administration, over 60 State and local 
education agencies have received funding from the Department of 
Education to provide programs that teach important values to our youth.
Many citizens around the country are helping in the effort to teach 
character to children. One of the most important ways to contribute is 
to become a mentor. By showing love, support, and compassion, one person 
can make a difference in the life of a child.
During National Character Counts Week and throughout the year, I 
encourage children and all Americans to make good choices in life, set 
high standards, and serve as leaders. By working together, we can all 
contribute

[[Page 127]]

to a culture of good citizenship and responsibility that strengthens our 
Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 16 through October 
22, 2005, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public 
officials, educators, librarians, parents, students, and all Americans 
to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and 
programs.

National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In times of crisis, our Nation depends on the courage and determination 
of the members of our National Guard and Reserve. Across our country, 
these dedicated citizen-soldiers are answering the call to serve. During 
National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week, we honor the 
vital contributions of members of our Guard and Reserve, and we express 
our gratitude for the support shown to them by their employers.
In every generation, America has turned to the National Guard and 
Reserve to help respond to natural disasters, secure our homeland, and 
defend our liberty. Today, National Guard and Reserve personnel are 
serving on the front lines of freedom in the war on terror, and they 
have provided vital relief to our citizens affected by Hurricanes 
Katrina and Rita. Balancing the demands of their families, civilian 
careers, and military assignments, members of our Guard and Reserve 
demonstrate personal courage, love of country, and a commitment to duty 
that inspires all Americans.
Employers play a critical role in helping the men and women of the 
National Guard and Reserve carry out their mission. In offices, schools, 
hospitals, and other workplaces, employers provide time off, pay, 
health-care benefits, and job security to their Guard and Reserve 
employees. These patriotic efforts allow our men and women in uniform to 
focus on their military assignments and help strengthen our country. 
Americans are grateful to these employers for putting the needs of our 
citizens and our country's safety and security first.
As we continue to fight terrorism and advance peace around the world, 
Americans stand strongly and proudly behind the men and women of the 
National Guard and Reserve, and we express our appreciation for the 
commitment of their employers.

[[Page 128]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

encourage all Americans to join me in expressing our thanks to members 
of our National Guard and Reserve and their civilian employers for their 
patriotism and sacrifices on behalf of our Nation. I also call upon 
State and local officials, private organizations, businesses, and all 
military commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.

National Forest Products Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's forests are a source of pride, and they provide crucial 
products and materials for our citizens and communities. As we celebrate 
National Forest Products Week, we recognize the importance of our 
forests to our economy and way of life, and we reaffirm our commitment 
to protecting them through wise stewardship and sensible land 
management.
Across our Nation, people and businesses use forest products to meet 
their daily needs. Forests provide paper for books and newspapers, 
lumber for homes and buildings, and materials for countless other items. 
As good citizens, we have a shared responsibility to cultivate and 
sustain our forests and minimize the risk of catastrophic fires that 
harm people, property, and the environment.
My Administration has made good forest stewardship a priority. Through 
the Healthy Forests Initiative, we are reducing the frequency and 
severity of wildfires by thinning out and removing forest undergrowth 
before disaster strikes. The commonsense management practices we are 
implementing are helping to strengthen our economy, keep communities 
safe, save the lives of firefighters, and protect threatened and 
endangered habitats and wildlife.
Sound conservation policies and responsible maintenance provide improved 
protection for our forests and greater economic prosperity for our 
citizens. During National Forest Products Week, we renew our commitment 
to sustain America's forests.
Recognizing the importance of our forests, the Congress, by Public Law 
86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on 
the third Sunday in October of each year as ``National Forest Products 
Week'' and has authorized and requested the President to issue a 
proclamation in observance of this week.

White Cane Safety Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans who are blind or visually impaired are valuable and 
contributing members of our society, and many use a white cane to help 
them succeed at school, home, or work. White canes give these 
individuals greater mobility and enable them to participate in more 
aspects of community life. On White Cane Safety Day, we celebrate the 
progress that has been made for those who are blind or visually 
impaired, and we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that these citizens 
can live and work with greater freedom and independence.
One of our Nation's defining values is compassion, and we must make 
certain that all our citizens are able to harness their talents, engage 
in productive work, and participate fully in society. My Administration 
is working to fulfill this goal for individuals with disabilities 
through the New Freedom Initiative. This comprehensive program helps 
increase the development and use of assistive and universally designed 
technologies, expand educational and employment opportunities, and 
improve access into daily community life. By working to reduce barriers 
and change old ways of thinking, we can help ensure that our Nation's 
opportunities are more accessible to all.
The Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-628) approved on 
October 6, 1964, as amended, has designated October 15 of each year as 
``White Cane Safety Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2005, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon public officials, business leaders, educators, librarians, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation 7950 of October 20, 2005

United Nations Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty years ago, the United Nations was created to spread hope and 
liberty, fight poverty and disease, and help secure human rights and 
human dignity for people everywhere. On United Nations Day, we recommit 
ourselves to the ideals on which this organization was founded.
Throughout history, the human spirit has been tested by the forces of 
darkness and evil. Since its founding in the aftermath of World War II, 
the United Nations has worked to solve problems and harness the best 
instincts of humankind. Today, we must continue efforts to ease 
suffering, spread freedom, and lay the foundations of lasting peace for 
our children and grandchildren.
In the aftermath of last year's tsunami in the Indian Ocean region and 
this month's earthquakes in South Asia, we have witnessed the great 
capacity of human compassion. The support from the United Nations 
demonstrated how nations of the world can unite in common purpose to 
address difficult challenges. This enduring truth inspired those who 
created the United Nations, and it continues to do so 60 years later. 
With courage and conscience, we will meet our responsibilities to 
protect the lives and rights of others. As we do this, we will help 
fulfill the great promise of the United Nations, ensuring that all 
people can enjoy the peace, freedom, and dignity our Creator intended.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2005, as 
United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor 
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas 
under the flag of the United States to honor the observance of United 
Nations Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 7952 of November 2, 2005

National Adoption Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

All children deserve strong families with mothers and fathers who are 
there to protect and love them. Every year, thousands of Americans 
extend the gift of family to a child through adoption. During National 
Adoption Month, we recognize the compassion of adoptive and foster 
families and renew our pledge to finding loving and stable homes for 
children in need.
Many of our citizens have revealed the good heart of America by opening 
their homes to children through adoption. We are grateful to every 
family who provides a safe, nurturing environment for their adopted 
children. Last year, an estimated 51,000 children were adopted from our 
Nation's foster care system, and tens of thousands more were adopted 
through private agencies and from overseas. Today, more than 118,000 
children remain in foster care in the United States awaiting adoption. 
On November 19, National Adoption Day, thousands of these children will 
celebrate the finalization of their adoptions and go to their new homes, 
secure in the love of families they can now call their own.
My Administration remains committed to encouraging adoption. This year, 
24 States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
were recognized through our Adoption Incentives Program for their 
efforts to enhance their adoption and child welfare programs. These 
efforts have contributed to an increase in adoptions from 28,000 per 
year in 1996 to an estimated 51,000 in 2004. In addition, the 
AdoptUSKids initiative, which includes public service announcements in 
English and Spanish and a website, www.AdoptUSKids.org, has helped place 
more than 5,000 children in permanent homes over the last 3 years.
As we observe National Adoption Month, we recognize the many caring 
families who have made a difference in a child's life through adoption. 
By giving these children the love, guidance, and support they need to 
grow, adoptive and foster families play a vital role in helping the next 
generation of Americans achieve their dreams.

[[Page 132]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2005 as National 
Adoption Month. I call on all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities to honor adoptive families and to 
participate in efforts to find permanent homes for waiting children.

Proclamation 7953 of November 2, 2005

National Diabetes Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans of all ages and backgrounds live with diabetes. Nearly 21 
million of our citizens have this disease, and researchers estimate that 
more than 6 million of these individuals have not been diagnosed and are 
unaware they have it. National Diabetes Month is an opportunity to 
educate citizens about diabetes and what they can do to help prevent and 
treat this disease.
Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes, destroys insulin-
producing cells and usually strikes children and teenagers. Nearly 95 
percent of all diabetics suffer from type 2 diabetes, a condition in 
which the body fails to produce or to use insulin properly. Type 2 
diabetes typically occurs in inactive or obese adults or individuals 
with a family history of the disease and now increasingly appears in 
inactive or overweight children. Because of a lack of insulin, diabetics 
face potential blindness, nontraumatic amputations, kidney disease, and 
increased risk of heart disease and stroke.
Studies have shown that minor weight loss and daily exercise can help 
prevent and reduce the effects of diabetes. I encourage all Americans to 
follow the new dietary guidelines released by the Department of Health 
and Human Services earlier this year that emphasize the importance of 
nutritious foods and regular physical activity. In addition to taking 
steps toward a healthier lifestyle, Americans should consult their 
doctors for preventive screenings to detect diabetes in its earliest 
stages. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and 
Modernization Act of 2003, these screenings are now covered for Medicare 
beneficiaries. These simple tests can save lives and help prevent this 
potentially life-threatening illness.
My Administration remains committed to fighting diabetes through 
research and prevention, and we will continue to support the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) and others in their efforts to combat this 
disease. This

[[Page 133]]

year, the NIH dedicated more than $1 billion to diabetes research. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the NIH are also 
sponsoring the National Diabetes Education Program, which has helped to 
inform more than 180 million Americans in the last 3 years about healthy 
choices and the risk factors of diabetes.
During National Diabetes Month and throughout the year, we pay tribute 
to the doctors, nurses, scientists, researchers, and all those dedicated 
to the fight against diabetes. I urge the millions of Americans living 
with this disease and all citizens to lead healthy lives and to motivate 
others to do the same. By working together to prevent this disease, we 
can improve the quality of life for more Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2005 as National 
Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the risk 
factors and symptoms associated with diabetes and to observe this month 
with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Proclamation 7954 of November 2, 2005

National Hospice Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The great strength of America lies in the hearts and souls of our 
citizens. During National Hospice Month, we recognize hospice caregivers 
who are building a more compassionate society, where life is valued and 
those in need can count on the love and support of others. We also 
recognize the courage and strength of terminally ill patients and their 
families.
When we help those who hurt and those in pain, we become part of our 
Nation's armies of compassion. Hospice programs provide an option for 
individuals with terminal illnesses to be cared for as they choose in 
their final days, often in their own homes and surrounded by the love of 
their families. The doctors, nurses, counselors, volunteers, and others 
who provide hospice care throughout our country bring comfort to those 
most in need every day, treating terminally ill patients with the 
dignity and respect they deserve. By dedicating themselves to the care 
of those approaching the end of life, they demonstrate great love.
The compassion reflected in hospice care is one of the reasons America 
has the best health care system in the world. Our whole Nation is 
grateful for the good work of our dedicated medical professionals and 
hospice caregivers. By taking the time to care for others, they are 
making America a better place.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2005 as National 
Hospice Month. I encourage all our citizens to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities. I also ask Americans to recognize 
our health care professionals and volunteers for their contributions to 
helping those facing terminal illness receive quality care.

Proclamation 7955 of November 2, 2005

Veterans Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans owe a great debt of gratitude to those who have sacrificed for 
our liberty and for the security of our Nation. We express deep 
appreciation to our veterans--the men and women who stepped forward when 
America needed them, triumphed over brutal enemies, liberated 
continents, and answered the prayers of millions around the globe.
From the beaches of Normandy and the snows of Korea to the mountains of 
Afghanistan and the deserts of Iraq, our courageous veterans have 
sacrificed so that Americans and others could live in freedom. As we 
mark the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II this year, we 
remember the millions of veterans who crossed oceans and defeated two of 
the most ruthless military forces the world has ever known. The freedom 
that the children and grandchildren of these veterans now enjoy is a 
monument to their fallen comrades and the generations of patriots who 
have served our country.
Through their commitment to freedom, America's veterans have lifted 
millions of lives and made our country and the world more secure. They 
have demonstrated to us that freedom is the mightiest force on Earth. We 
resolve that their sacrifices will always be remembered by a grateful 
Nation.
With respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service men 
and women have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, 
the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each 
year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2005, as Veterans Day and urge 
all Americans to observe November 6 through November 12, 2005, as 
National Veterans Awareness Week. I urge all Americans to recognize the 
valor and sacrifice of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers. I 
call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the 
United States and to encourage and participate in patriotic activities 
in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places 
of worship,

[[Page 135]]

schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this national 
observance with commemorative expressions and programs.

Proclamation 7956 of November 2, 2005

National American Indian Heritage Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National American Indian Heritage Month honors the many contributions 
and accomplishments of American Indians and Alaska Natives. During 
November, we remember the legacy of the first Americans and celebrate 
their vibrant and living traditions.
The American Indian experience is central to the American story, and my 
Administration is committed to helping Native American cultures across 
the United States continue to flourish. One of the most important ways 
to ensure a successful future is through education. Over the past 4 
years, my Administration has provided more than $1 billion for the 
construction and renovation of Bureau of Indian Affairs schools. We also 
offer direct assistance for educator and counselor training to help make 
sure every classroom has a qualified teacher and every child has the 
tools he or she needs to succeed. As we work with tribal leaders to 
provide students with a superior education that respects the unique 
culture and traditions of the community, we can help ensure every child 
has the opportunity to realize their dreams.
To enhance energy opportunities and strengthen tribal economies, my 
Administration is working to ease the regulatory barriers associated 
with tribal energy development. In August, I signed the Energy Policy 
Act of 2005, allocating $2 billion in the form of grants, loans, and 
loan guarantees for exploration, development, and production of energy. 
This legislation will help ensure that latest energy technologies are 
being used throughout our country.
Since the earliest days of our Republic, Native Americans have played a 
vital role in our country's freedom and security. From the Revolutionary 
War scouts to the Code Talkers of World War II, Native Americans have 
served in all branches of America's Armed Forces. Today, that proud 
tradition continues, with Native Americans bravely defending our country 
in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom and helping to spread 
liberty around the world. America is grateful to all our service men and 
women who serve and sacrifice in the defense of freedom.
Our young country is home to an ancient, noble, and enduring native 
culture, and my Administration recognizes the defining principles of 
tribal

[[Page 136]]

sovereignty and the right to self-determination. By working together, 
government to government, on important education, economic, and energy 
initiatives, we can strengthen America and build a future of hope and 
promise for all Native Americans. This month, we pay tribute to the 
American Indians and Alaska Natives who continue to shape our Nation. I 
encourage all citizens to learn more about the rich heritage of Native 
Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2005 as National 
American Indian Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate 
this month with appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation 7957 of November 2, 2005

National Family Caregivers Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each November, as Americans reflect on our many blessings, we observe 
National Family Caregivers Month and give thanks for the selfless 
service of family caregivers on behalf of their loved ones in need. The 
tireless devotion of these Americans brings comfort and peace of mind to 
our Nation's elderly and to those who are chronically ill or disabled.
Family caregivers play an important role in communities across the 
United States. They provide most of the homecare services in our country 
and work hard to meet the emotional and physical needs of the family 
members and friends for whom they care. Through the National Family 
Caregiver Support Program, my Administration continues to encourage 
States and local agencies on aging to partner with faith-based, 
community, and tribal organizations. These partnerships can offer family 
caregivers the important information, counseling, training, respite 
care, and support services they need.
This November, enrollment begins under the new Medicare prescription 
drug benefit, which offers more affordable access to prescription drugs, 
better health care choices, and extra help to low-income seniors and 
beneficiaries with disabilities. This new coverage will help family 
caregivers, who often inform or make medical decisions for those they 
care for, by ensuring that their loved ones receive the best health care 
available.
Every day, family caregivers sacrifice their own needs to offer their 
loved ones the opportunity to live with dignity and independence in 
familiar surroundings. Their love, selflessness, and devotion inspire us 
all and demonstrate the compassionate spirit of America.

[[Page 137]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2005 as National 
Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to honor and support 
those who serve as caregivers to their family members, friends, and 
neighbors in need.

Proclamation 7958 of November 3, 2005

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month is an opportunity to 
recognize the strength of family members, doctors, nurses, volunteers, 
and others who provide care for those living with this devastating 
disease. During this month, we also reaffirm our commitment to victims 
of this disease. We hope to enhance the quality of life for Alzheimer's 
patients and improve prevention and treatment.
Approximately 4.5 million Americans are affected by Alzheimer's disease. 
The disease gradually destroys parts of the brain that control memory, 
learning, communication, and reason. As it progresses, individuals may 
also experience changes in behavior and personality, leading to severely 
impaired cognitive abilities and the need for full-time care and 
assistance. Age remains the greatest risk factor--the National Institute 
on Aging estimates that the percentage of people who develop Alzheimer's 
disease doubles for each 5-year age group beyond 65. Alzheimer's affects 
nearly half of those over 85.
While there is no known cure or certain treatment, researchers are 
learning more about what causes this tragic disease and how to control 
its symptoms. My Administration remains committed to funding medical 
research programs to help prevent, treat, and find a cure for 
Alzheimer's disease. The National Institute on Aging has begun new 
initiatives to improve development and testing of medicines that may 
slow progression of the disease. The Department of Veterans Affairs is 
supporting research through its Geriatric Research, Education and 
Clinical Centers, and the Administration on Aging is working to improve 
home and community-based services for Alzheimer's patients. By working 
together, we can learn more about treatment options and bring greater 
comfort to those afflicted with this disease.
Our Nation is grateful for the scientists, researchers, and health care 
professionals who are dedicated to treating Alzheimer's patients and 
finding a cure. We are also grateful for the hard work and compassionate 
spirit of family members and caregivers. Their efforts reflect the 
character and spirit of America.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of

Proclamation 7960 of November 9, 2005

World Freedom Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On November 9, 1989, citizens of East Germany crowded the checkpoints at 
the Berlin Wall and forced their way to freedom. In the ensuing weeks 
and months, this unquenchable thirst for liberty led to the collapse of 
the Soviet empire and the downfall of communism in the Soviet Union. 
Today,

[[Page 139]]

most of the Central and Eastern European nations that once formed part 
of the Soviet bloc are thriving democracies and allies in the cause of 
peace and freedom.
The fall of the Berlin Wall showed the world that the love of liberty is 
stronger than the will of tyranny. In this new century, free nations are 
again responding to a global campaign of terror with a global campaign 
of freedom. We are working to extend the promise of freedom in our 
country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the 
peace that freedom brings.
On World Freedom Day, we commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 
reunification of the German people. We honor the men and women who 
fought against communist oppression and all those who continue to fight 
against tyranny. We also renew our commitment to advancing liberty, 
democracy, and human rights.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2005, as World 
Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
day with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to reaffirm their 
dedication to freedom and democracy.

National Farm-City Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Farming is America's first industry, and the success of America's 
farmers and ranchers is crucial to the prosperity of our country. During 
National Farm-City Week, we recognize the important relationship between 
rural and urban industries that helps keep our farmers and our Nation 
strong.
America's farmers and ranchers work hard, and they provide a healthy, 
safe, and abundant food supply for our citizens and for countless 
individuals abroad. In order to make their goods available to the 
public, they depend on partnerships with processors, transporters, 
marketers, distributors, and many others. These cooperative networks 
make up America's robust agricultural industry and account for about 
one-sixth of all jobs in the United States.
My Administration understands that our farm economy is a source of 
strength for our Nation, and we remain committed to advancing policies 
that will improve our country's agricultural industry. We have 
successfully implemented the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 
2002, which significantly increased conservation funding and provided an 
important

[[Page 140]]

safety net for our farmers. Earlier this year, I signed the Central 
American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, which will help ensure 
that free trade is fair trade and level the playing field for American 
products exported to Central America. To continue to open new markets 
for America's farmers and ranchers, we must also work for a free and 
fair global trading system. Through the World Trade Organization's Doha 
Round of trade negotiations, we are seeking to reduce and eliminate 
tariffs and other barriers to U.S. agricultural goods.
As we celebrate National Farm-City Week, we express appreciation for 
those who make a living off the land. Their hard work and dedication to 
maintaining strong networks between rural areas and urban communities 
helps to feed, clothe, and provide energy for Americans and others 
around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 18 through 
November 24, 2005, as National Farm-City Week. I encourage all Americans 
to join in recognizing the great accomplishments of our farmers and 
ranchers and the entrepreneurship and ingenuity of countless others who 
produce America's agricultural goods.

America Recycles Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On America Recycles Day, we recognize the importance of recycling and 
using products made with recycled materials. Today, Americans recycle 
many items, including motor oil, tires, aluminum cans, plastic, glass, 
batteries, and building materials. These community efforts are designed 
to make a difference in our environment and help improve our quality of 
life.
The Federal Government is working to expand opportunities for recycling 
across our country. I recently signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 
2005, which will increase the use of recycled materials in Federal 
construction projects. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) operates the Resource Conservation Challenge, a national effort to 
encourage manufacturers, businesses, and consumers to raise the national 
recycling rate to 35 percent. To help achieve this goal, the EPA 
launched the Plug-In To eCycling Campaign in cooperation with American 
businesses. This partnership helps increase awareness about the 
importance of reusing and safely recycling electronics and provides the 
public with additional opportunities to recycle.

[[Page 141]]

Throughout the year, I encourage individuals, businesses, and government 
entities to participate in recycling programs in their communities. 
These efforts contribute to a culture of responsible citizenship and 
good stewardship of our natural heritage, and they can help ensure a 
cleaner, safer, and healthier environment for our children and 
grandchildren.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2005, as

Thanksgiving Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Thanksgiving Day is a time to remember our many blessings and to 
celebrate the opportunities that freedom affords. Explorers and settlers 
arriving in this land often gave thanks for the extraordinary plenty 
they found. And today, we remain grateful to live in a country of 
liberty and abundance. We give thanks for the love of family and 
friends, and we ask God to continue to watch over America.
This Thanksgiving, we pray and express thanks for the men and women who 
work to keep America safe and secure. Members of our Armed Forces, State 
and local law enforcement, and first responders embody our Nation's 
highest ideals of courage and devotion to duty. Our country is grateful 
for their service and for the support and sacrifice of their families. 
We ask God's special blessings on those who have lost loved ones in the 
line of duty.
We also remember those affected by the destruction of natural disasters. 
Their tremendous determination to recover their lives exemplifies the 
American spirit, and we are grateful for those across our Nation who 
answered the cries of their neighbors in need and provided them with 
food, shelter, and a helping hand. We ask for continued strength and 
perseverance as we work to rebuild these communities and return hope to 
our citizens.
We give thanks to live in a country where freedom reigns, justice 
prevails, and hope prospers. We recognize that America is a better place 
when we answer the universal call to love a neighbor and help those in 
need. May God bless and guide the United States of America as we move 
forward.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and

National Family Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Families give our society direction and purpose. During National Family 
Week, we celebrate the many contributions families make to our country.
Throughout America's history, families have been the foundation of our 
society and a source of stability and love for every generation. Strong 
families teach children to live moral lives and help us pass down the 
values that define a caring society. By nurturing a child's personal 
development and providing a safe environment for growth, families 
prepare our Nation's youth to realize the promise of America. Family is 
one of the three cornerstones of the Helping America's Youth initiative, 
led by First Lady Laura Bush. We are working with families, schools, and 
communities to help children make right choices and build healthy, 
successful lives. Through USA Freedom Corps, my Administration is also 
providing opportunities for families to volunteer together and make a 
positive difference in their communities.
At this crucial hour in the history of freedom, our Nation is grateful 
for the sacrifice of our military families who love and support the men 
and women of our Armed Forces. My Administration is committed to 
providing a better quality of life for our military families and helping 
them plan for the future. During National Family Week and throughout the 
year, Americans stand solidly behind the men and women of our Armed 
Forces and join all military families as they pray for the safety and 
strength of their sons and daughters, husbands and wives, and fathers 
and mothers.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20 through 
November 26, 2005, as National Family Week. I invite the States,

observing this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor 
our Nation's families.

Proclamation 7965 of November 22, 2005

National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, we renew our 
efforts to educate all Americans about the tragic consequences of 
impaired driving and encourage all Americans to drive responsibly.
Every year, too many of our citizens get behind the wheel of an 
automobile after drinking alcohol or using drugs. This puts drivers, 
passengers, and others on the road at risk. Last year alone, drunk 
driving killed more than 16,000 people and accounted for more than 30 
percent of all motor vehicle deaths.
My Administration remains committed to saving lives and preventing 
injuries resulting from drunk and drugged driving. The Department of 
Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration oversees 
the ``You Drink & Drive. You Lose.'' program, which educates our 
citizens about the dangers of driving under the influence. This campaign 
also encourages lifesaving measures to help keep impaired drivers off 
the road--including sobriety checkpoints, saturation patrols, and 
prosecution of those who break the law. To protect our Nation's young 
people and deter underage drinking, the Helping America's Youth 
initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, is promoting positive youth 
development and educating our children about the dangers associated with 
alcohol and drug use. With the help of parents, educators, and faith-
based and community organizations, this initiative teaches our children 
to avoid alcohol and drug use, make healthy choices, and build lives of 
purpose.
Keeping drunk and drugged drivers off the road is vital for the safety 
of our loved ones and fellow citizens. All Americans can encourage 
responsible actions and work to ensure that those around them do not 
operate a vehicle while under the influence. When law enforcement, 
communities, and individuals unite against impaired driving, lives are 
saved and our Nation's roadways are made safer for everyone.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2005 as National 
Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. I encourage all Americans to 
help keep our Nation's roadways safe by making responsible decisions and 
taking appropriate measures to prevent drunk and drugged driving.

Proclamation 7966 of November 28, 2005

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, we pray for those lost on 
December 7, 1941, and we honor the courage of a generation of Americans 
who devoted themselves to one of the great missions in our country's 
history. After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor took more than 2,400 
American lives, millions of our citizens answered the call to defend our 
liberty, and the world witnessed the power of freedom to overcome 
tyranny.
Liberty's ultimate triumph was far from clear in the early days of World 
War II. When our country was attacked at Pearl Harbor, America was 
emerging from the Great Depression, and several nations had larger 
armies than the United States. In Asia and Europe, country after country 
had fallen before the armies of militaristic tyrants. However, the brave 
and determined men and women of our Nation maintained their faith in the 
power of freedom and democracy. They fought and won a world war against 
two of the most ruthless regimes the world has ever known. In the years 
since those victories, the power of freedom and democracy has 
transformed America's enemies in World War II into close friends.
Today, our goal is to continue to spread freedom and democracy and to 
secure a more peaceful world for our children and grandchildren. We are 
grateful to the men and women who are defending our flag and our freedom 
in the first war of the 21st century. These patriots are protecting our 
country and our way of life by upholding the tradition of honor, 
bravery, and integrity demonstrated by those who fought for our Nation 
in World War II. The service and sacrifice of our World War II veterans 
continue to inspire people across our country, and we remain deeply 
grateful for all that these heroes have done for the cause of freedom.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2005, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this solemn 
occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal

Proclamation 7967 of December 1, 2005

World AIDS Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On World AIDS Day, we remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS, 
and we recommit ourselves to fighting and preventing HIV/AIDS and to 
comforting those infected and their loved ones.
The United States is working with its partners around the world to turn 
the tide against HIV/AIDS. In May 2003, we committed $15 billion over 5 
years to support treatment, prevention, and care. This plan is designed 
to support and strengthen the AIDS-fighting strategies of many nations, 
including 15 affected countries in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. 
Approximately 400,000 men, women, and children in sub-Saharan Africa 
have received life-saving treatment supported through this program. This 
is a remarkable improvement from 2 years ago, when just 50,000 people in 
sub-Saharan Africa were receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS. The plan 
focuses on the ABC prevention message--Abstain, Be faithful, and use 
Condoms--with abstinence being the only sure way to prevent the sexual 
transmission of HIV/AIDS. We are also working with faith-based and 
community organizations and local leaders around the world to expand 
testing facilities, upgrade clinics and hospitals, and train and support 
medical personnel.
Here at home, more than 1 million people suffer from HIV/AIDS. To stop 
the spread of this virus, we are focusing extraordinary Federal efforts 
and resources to increase routine voluntary testing, improve access to 
life-extending care, and develop a vaccine. We are also grateful for the 
work of faith-based and community programs whose efforts in these areas 
are helping to improve the lives of our citizens.
On World AIDS Day, we recognize the effect of HIV/AIDS and renew our 
commitment to defeat this pandemic. Americans believe that every life 
matters and every person counts. The United States will continue to 
spread a vision of hope as we stand with people from around the world to 
face the challenges of HIV/AIDS with courage and determination. 
Together, we can build a better future for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2005, as World 
AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to 
this deadly disease and to comfort and support those living with HIV/
AIDS.

Proclamation 7968 of December 9, 2005

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Americans believe that freedom is God's gift to every man and woman in 
the world. The Founders adopted our Constitution to secure the blessings 
of liberty for the people of the United States, and since 1789, 
generations of Americans have defended and advanced freedom in our 
Nation.
Throughout our history, the United States has also worked to extend the 
promise of liberty to other countries. We are continuing those efforts 
today. We are promoting democracies that respect freedom of speech, 
freedom of worship, and freedom of the press and that protect the rights 
of minorities and women. We are standing with dissidents and exiles 
against oppressive regimes and tyranny.
This year has seen great advances in the spread of democracy and human 
rights. In January, more than eight million Iraqi men and women braved 
threats of violence to vote for a provisional government. In October, 
Iraqis voted in even greater numbers to approve a draft constitution for 
their country, and on December 15, they will return to the polls to 
elect a Council of Representatives. Millions of Afghans voted in 
September in the first free legislative elections in Afghanistan in 
decades. Countries of the former Soviet bloc are emerging as thriving 
democracies. A free press is gaining ground in Kyrgyzstan, and civil 
institutions are being strengthened in Ukraine and Georgia. We have 
witnessed good progress this year, and America will continue this 
historic work to advance the cause of freedom.
We remain confident in this cause because we have seen the power of 
freedom to overcome the dark ideologies of tyranny and terror. Freedom 
enables men and women to live lives of dignity. And freedom gives the 
citizens of a nation confidence in a future of peace for their children 
and grandchildren. As we observe Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, 
and Human Rights Week, we renew our commitment to building a world where 
human rights are respected and protected by the rule of law and where 
all people can enjoy freedom and dignity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 2005, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 2005, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 2005, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to mark these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 7969 of December 16, 2005

Wright Brothers Day, 2005

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On December 17, 1903, a wooden aircraft lifted from the sands of Kitty 
Hawk, North Carolina, remaining airborne for 12 seconds and covering a 
distance of 40 yards. That first powered flight was a heroic moment in 
our Nation's history and in the story of mankind. On Wright Brothers 
Day, we celebrate the journey that began at Kitty Hawk and commemorate 
the imagination, ingenuity, and determination of Orville and Wilbur 
Wright.
The American experience in air and space is an epic of endurance and 
discovery. The past 102 years have brought supersonic flight, space 
travel, and the exploration of the Moon and Mars. Charles Lindbergh's 
solo, nonstop passage across the Atlantic Ocean and the record-breaking 
flights of Amelia Earhart captured the public's imagination and 
encouraged the growth of aviation. Americans such as Chuck Yeager, the 
first man to break the sound barrier, and Alan Shepard, the first 
American in space, and Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first men on 
the Moon, led our Nation on a voyage of discovery. These pioneers 
explored the unknown and brought the bold dream of the Wright Brothers 
into the future. Their dedication and skill and that of countless others 
reflect the finest values of our country and have helped ensure that the 
United States continues to lead the world in flight.
Americans will always be risk-takers for the sake of exploration. As we 
remember the achievements of the Wright Brothers, we look forward to 
challenging the frontiers of knowledge in a new century.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963 (77 Stat. 
402; 36 U.S.C. 143) as amended, has designated December 17 of each year 
as ``Wright Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested the 
President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the 
United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 2005, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth 
and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200) (AGOA), authorizes 
the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA 
(19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ``beneficiary sub-Saharan African country'' if the 
President determines that the country meets the eligibility requirements 
set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703), as well as the 
eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2462).
2. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a 
country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an ``eligible sub-Saharan 
African country'' if the President determines that the country meets 
certain eligibility requirements.

special rules for certain apparel articles imported from ``lesser 
developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.''
4. In Proclamation 7350 of October 2, 2000, the President designated the 
Islamic Republic of Mauritania (Mauritania) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country pursuant to section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act and 
provided that it would be considered a lesser developed beneficiary sub-
Saharan African country for purposes of section 112(b)(3)(B) of the

the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act.
6. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 
1974 Act, I have determined that the Republic of Burundi (Burundi) meets 
the eligibility requirements set forth or referenced therein, and I have 
decided to designate Burundi as an eligible sub-Saharan African country 
and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.
7. I further determine that Burundi satisfies the criterion for 
treatment as a ``lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country'' under section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA.
8. Pursuant to section 506A(a)(3) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that Mauritania is not making continual progress in meeting the

Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the designation of Mauritania 
as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of section 
506A of the 1974 Act, effective on January 1, 2006.
9. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes 
the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the

United States the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other

``Islamic Republic of Mauritania'' from the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African countries. Further, U.S. note 2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 
of the HTS is modified by removing ``Islamic Republic of Mauritania'' from 
the list of lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.

To Implement the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On June 15, 2004, the United States entered into the United States-
Morocco Free Trade Agreement (USMFTA). The USMFTA was approved by the 
Congress in section 101(a) of the United States-Morocco Free Trade

[[Page 150]]

Agreement Implementation Act (the ``USMFTA Act'') (Public Law 108-302, 
118 Stat. 1103) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note).
2. Section 105(a) of the USMFTA Act authorizes the President to 
establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office that 
shall be responsible for providing administrative assistance to panels 
established under Chapter 20 of the USMFTA.
3. Section 201 of the USMFTA Act authorizes the President to proclaim 
such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of 
duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties as the 
President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or 
apply Articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 4.1, 4.3.9, 4.3.10, 4.3.11, 4.3.13, 
4.3.14, and 4.3.15, and the schedule of reductions with respect to 
Morocco set forth in Annex IV of the USMFTA.
4. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the USMFTA Act, Morocco is to be 
removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing 
countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP). Further, consistent with section 604 of the Trade Act 
of 1974 (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, I have 
determined that other technical and conforming changes to the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) are necessary to reflect that 
Morocco is no longer eligible to receive benefits of the GSP.
5. Section 203 of the USMFTA Act provides certain rules for determining 
whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing 
preferential tariff treatment under the USMFTA. I have decided that it 
is necessary to include these rules of origin, together with particular 
rules applicable to certain other goods, in the HTS.

certain enforcement actions relating to trade with Morocco in textile 
and apparel goods.

implementation of textile trade agreements.
9. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended, authorizes the President to 
embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or 
other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, acting under authority vested in me by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
sections 201, 203, 204, and 321-328 of the USMFTA Act, section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do 
proclaim that:

  (1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment 
being accorded under the USMFTA, to set forth rules for determining whether 
goods imported into the customs territory of the United States are eligible 
for preferential tariff treatment under the USMFTA, to provide certain 
other treatment to originating goods for the purposes of the

[[Page 151]]

USMFTA, to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain originating 
goods, to reflect Morocco's removal from the enumeration of designated 
beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, and to make 
technical and conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS 
is modified as set forth in Annex I of Publication No. 3721 of the United 
States International Trade Commission, entitled ``Modifications to the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Implementing the United 
States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement'' (Publication 3721), which is 
incorporated by reference into this proclamation.

  (2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty elimination provided 
for in the USMFTA, and to provide for future staged reductions in duties 
for products of Morocco for purposes of the USMFTA, the HTS is modified as 
provided in Annex II of Publication 3721, effective on the dates specified 
in the relevant sections of such publication and on any subsequent dates 
set forth for such duty reductions in that publication.

  (3) The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to exercise my authority 
under section 105(a) of the USMFTA Act to establish or designate an office 
within the Department of Commerce to carry out the functions set forth in 
that section.

  (4) (a) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this 
proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates indicated in 
Annex II to Publication 3721.

proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2006.

(5) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 204 of 
the USMFTA Act to exclude textile and apparel goods from the customs 
territory of the United States; to determine whether an enterprise's 
production of, and capability to produce, goods are consistent with 
statements by the enterprise; to find that an enterprise has knowingly 
or willfully engaged in circumvention; and to deny preferential tariff 
treatment to textile and apparel goods.
(6) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under subtitle B of 
title III of the USMFTA Act to review requests, and to determine whether 
to commence consideration of such requests; to cause to be published in

Proclamation 7972 of December 22, 2005

National Mentoring Month, 2006

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Through countless acts of kindness, mentors across America are changing 
our Nation for the better. Every child deserves the opportunity to 
realize the promise of our country, and mentors show that a single soul 
can make a difference in a young person's life. During National 
Mentoring Month, we recognize the many individuals who dedicate their 
time, talents, and energy to help children develop character and 
integrity.
Mentors are soldiers in the armies of compassion, sharing their time to 
help provide a supportive example for a young person. Mentors help 
children resist peer pressure, achieve results in school, stay off 
drugs, and make the right choices. Many people become mentors because of 
the impact of a mentor in their own lives, creating a chain of 
compassion over the course of generations.
My Administration remains committed to promoting mentoring as an 
opportunity to strengthen our country. Through the Helping America's 
Youth initiative, led by First Lady Laura Bush, we will continue to 
focus on identifying best practices and programs across this great 
Nation that are changing lives for the better and helping young people 
grow up to be responsible and successful adults.
In 2006, my Administration will support funding programs to mentor 
children who have a parent in prison and for youth at risk of gang 
influence and involvement. The Federal Government can also help local 
communities by fostering communication between those who are running 
successful programs and those who want to get involved. Americans can 
find valuable mentoring opportunities in their hometown by visiting the 
USA Freedom Corps website at www.USAFreedomCorps.gov or calling 1-877-
USACORP.
I appreciate the faith-based and community organizations and all those 
dedicated to improving the lives of America's children through 
mentoring. By showing love, support, and compassion, one person can make 
a difference in the life of a child and help that child learn the 
importance of serving a cause greater than self. The teachers, coaches, 
religious leaders, relatives, and other caring adults who mentor 
contribute to a culture of good citizenship. Their efforts strengthen 
our country and demonstrate the great influence of one person's kindness 
and its ability to touch a life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2006 as National 
Mentoring Month. I call upon the people of the United States to 
recognize the importance of mentoring, to look for opportunities to 
serve as mentors

[[Page 153]]

in their communities, and to observe this month with appropriate 
activities and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
thirtieth.

Executive Order 13382 of June 28, 2005

Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and Their 
Supporters

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of 
title 3, United States Code,
I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, in order 
to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency 
described and declared in Executive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994, 
regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means 
of delivering them, and the measures imposed by that order, as expanded 
by Executive Order 13094 of July 28, 1998, hereby order:
Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), 
and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), or in 
regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant 
to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any 
license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all 
property and interests in property of the following persons, that are in 
the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that 
are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States 
persons, are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, 
withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:

(i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order;

(ii) any foreign person determined by the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and 
other relevant agencies, to have engaged, or attempted to engage, in 
activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or pose a 
risk of materially contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction or their means of delivery (including missiles capable of 
delivering such weapons), including any efforts to manufacture, acquire, 
possess, develop, transport, transfer or use such items, by any person or 
foreign country of proliferation concern;

(iii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and other 
relevant agencies, to have provided, or attempted to provide, financial, 
material, technological or other support for, or goods or services in 
support of, any activity or transaction described in paragraph (a)(ii) of 
this section, or any person whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to this order; and

[[Page 171]]

(iv) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and other 
relevant agencies, to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to 
act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property 
and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.

    (b) Any transaction or dealing by a United States person or within 
the United States in property or interests in property blocked pursuant 
to this order is prohibited, including, but not limited to, (i) the 
making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, 
to, or for the benefit of, any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order, and (ii) the receipt of any 
contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such 
person.
    (c) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United 
States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or 
attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is 
prohibited.
    (d) Any conspiracy formed to violate the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
Sec. 2. For purposes of this order:
    (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
    (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and
    (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.
Sec. 3. I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of, any person whose property and interests 
in property are blocked pursuant to this order would seriously impair my 
ability to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
12938, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by section 1 of 
this order.
Sec. 4. Section 4(a) of Executive Order 12938, as amended, is further 
amended to read as follows:
    ``Sec. 4. Measures Against Foreign Persons.
    (a) Determination by Secretary of State; Imposition of Measures. 
Except to the extent provided in section 203(b) of the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)), where applicable, if 
the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the 
Treasury, determines that a foreign person, on or after November 16, 
1990, the effective date of Executive Order 12735, the predecessor order 
to Executive Order 12938, has engaged, or attempted to engage, in 
activities or transactions that have materially contributed to, or pose 
a risk of materially contributing to, the proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction or their means of delivery (including missiles capable 
of delivering such weapons), including any efforts to manufacture, 
acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer, or use such items, by 
any person or foreign country of proliferation concern, the measures set 
forth in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be imposed 
on that foreign person to the extent determined by the Secretary of 
State, in consultation with the implementing agency and other relevant

[[Page 172]]

agencies. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude the imposition 
on that foreign person of other measures or sanctions available under 
this order or under other authorities.''
Sec. 5. For those persons whose property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order who might have a 
constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the 
ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice 
to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would 
render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these 
measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 12938, as amended, there need be no prior notice of a 
listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, 
where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely 
manner of the measures taken.
Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine, subsequent to the 
issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the 
inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and that the property 
and interests in property of that person are therefore no longer blocked 
pursuant to section 1 of this order.
Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or 
benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by 
any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, 
instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other 
person.
Sec. 9. (a) This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 
on June 29, 2005.
    (b) This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and published in 
the Federal Register.

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the

National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of

respect to the continued actions and policies of certain persons who 
undermine Zimbabwe's

[[Page 207]]

democratic processes and with respect to the national emergency 
described and declared in Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003,
I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby 
order:
Section 1. The Annex to Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, is 
replaced and superseded in its entirety by the Annex to this order.
Sec. 2. Section 6 of Executive Order 13288 is renumbered as section 8. 
Sections 1 through 5 of Executive Order 13288 are replaced with new 
sections 1 through 7 as follows:
    ``Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), 
(3), and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), and in 
regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant 
to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any 
license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all 
property and interests in property of the following persons, that are in 
the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that 
are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States 
persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked and may not be 
transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:

  (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and

  (ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State:

         (A) to have engaged in actions or policies to undermine 
        Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions;
         (B) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided 
        financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or 
        services in support of, such actions or policies or any person 
        whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
        this order;
         (C) to be or have been an immediate family member of any person 
        whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
        this order; or
         (D) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to 
        act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person 
        whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to 
        this order.
     (b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of 
articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) 
by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section would 
seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared 
in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by 
paragraph (a) of this section.
     (c) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include but 
are not limited to (i) the making of any contribution or provision of 
funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose 
property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order, 
and (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, 
or services from any such person.

[[Page 208]]

    Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the 
United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or 
avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in 
this order is prohibited.
     (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set 
forth in this order is prohibited.
    Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order:
     (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;
     (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, 
joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; and
     (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States 
citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of 
the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States 
(including foreign branches), or any person in the United States.
    Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests in property 
are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional 
presence in the United States, I find that, because of the ability to 
transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such 
persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render 
these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that, for these 
measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared 
in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or 
determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.
    Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including 
the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers 
granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the 
purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any 
of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States 
Government, consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United 
States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures 
within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, 
where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely 
manner of the measures taken.
    Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine, subsequent to the 
issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the 
inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and that the property 
and interests in property of that person are therefore no longer blocked 
pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.
    Sec. 7. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, 
any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable 
at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its 
departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or 
employees, or any other person.''
Sec. 3. This order is not intended to create, nor does it create, any 
right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at 
law or in equity by any party against the United States, its 
departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or 
employees, or any other person.
Sec. 4. This order shall take effect at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard 
time, November 23, 2005.

[[Page 209]]

Sec. 5. This order shall be transmitted to the Congress and published in 
the Federal Register.

well informed. For nearly four decades, the Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) has provided an important means through which the public can 
obtain information regarding the activities of Federal agencies. Under 
the FOIA, the public can obtain records from any Federal agency, subject 
to the exemptions enacted by the Congress to protect information that 
must be held in confidence for the Government to function effectively or 
for other purposes.
    (b) FOIA requesters are seeking a service from the Federal 
Government and should be treated as such. Accordingly, in responding to 
a FOIA request, agencies shall respond courteously and appropriately. 
Moreover, agencies shall provide FOIA requesters, and the public in 
general, with citizen-centered ways to learn about the FOIA process, 
about agency records that are publicly available (e.g., on the agency's 
website), and about the status of a person's FOIA request and 
appropriate information about the agency's response.
    (c) Agency FOIA operations shall be both results-oriented and 
produce results. Accordingly, agencies shall process requests under the 
FOIA in an efficient and appropriate manner and achieve tangible, 
measurable improvements in FOIA processing. When an agency's FOIA 
program does not produce such results, it should be reformed, consistent 
with available resources appropriated by the Congress and applicable 
law, to increase efficiency and better reflect the policy goals and 
objectives of this order.
    (d) A citizen-centered and results-oriented approach will improve 
service and performance, thereby strengthening compliance with the FOIA, 
and will help avoid disputes and related litigation.
Sec. 2. Agency Chief FOIA Officers.
    (a) Designation. The head of each agency shall designate within 30 
days of the date of this order a senior official of such agency (at the 
Assistant Secretary or equivalent level), to serve as the Chief FOIA 
Officer of that agency. The head of the agency shall promptly notify the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) and the 
Attorney General of such designation and of any changes thereafter in 
such designation.
    (b) General Duties. The Chief FOIA Officer of each agency shall, 
subject to the authority of the head of the agency:

(i) have agency-wide responsibility for efficient and appropriate 
compliance with the FOIA;

[[Page 217]]

(ii) monitor FOIA implementation throughout the agency, including through 
the use of meetings with the public to the extent deemed appropriate by the 
agency's Chief FOIA Officer, and keep the head of the agency, the chief 
legal officer of the agency, and the Attorney General appropriately 
informed of the agency's performance in implementing the FOIA, including 
the extent to which the agency meets the milestones in the agency's plan 
under section 3(b) of this order and training and reporting standards 
established consistent with applicable law and this order;

(iii) recommend to the head of the agency such adjustments to agency 
practices, policies, personnel, and funding as may be necessary to carry 
out the policy set forth in section 1 of this order;

(iv) review and report, through the head of the agency, at such times and 
in such formats as the Attorney General may direct, on the agency's 
performance in implementing the FOIA; and

(v) facilitate public understanding of the purposes of the FOIA's statutory 
exemptions by including concise descriptions of the exemptions in both the 
agency's FOIA handbook issued under section 552(g) of title 5, United 
States Code, and the agency's annual FOIA report, and by providing an 
overview, where appropriate, of certain general categories of agency 
records to which those exemptions apply.

    (c) FOIA Requester Service Center and FOIA Public Liaisons. In order 
to ensure appropriate communication with FOIA requesters:

(i) Each agency shall establish one or more FOIA Requester Service Centers 
(Center), as appropriate, which shall serve as the first place that a FOIA 
requester can contact to seek information concerning the status of the 
person's FOIA request and appropriate information about the agency's FOIA 
response. The Center shall include appropriate staff to receive and respond 
to inquiries from FOIA requesters;

(ii) The agency Chief FOIA Officer shall designate one or more agency 
officials, as appropriate, as FOIA Public Liaisons, who may serve in the 
Center or who may serve in a separate office. FOIA Public Liaisons shall 
serve as supervisory officials to whom a FOIA requester can raise concerns 
about the service the FOIA requester has received from the Center, 
following an initial response from the Center staff. FOIA Public Liaisons 
shall seek to ensure a service-oriented response to FOIA requests and FOIA-
related inquiries. For example, the FOIA Public Liaison shall assist, as 
appropriate, in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding 
of the status of requests, and resolving disputes. FOIA Public Liaisons 
shall report to the agency Chief FOIA Officer on their activities and shall 
perform their duties consistent with applicable law and agency regulations;

(iii) In addition to the services to FOIA requesters provided by the Center 
and FOIA Public Liaisons, the agency Chief FOIA Officer shall also consider 
what other FOIA-related assistance to the public should appropriately be 
provided by the agency;

(iv) In establishing the Centers and designating FOIA Public Liaisons, the 
agency shall use, as appropriate, existing agency staff and resources. A 
Center shall have appropriate staff to receive and respond to inquiries 
from FOIA requesters;

[[Page 218]]

(v) As determined by the agency Chief FOIA Officer, in consultation with 
the FOIA Public Liaisons, each agency shall post appropriate information 
about its Center or Centers on the agency's website, including contact 
information for its FOIA Public Liaisons. In the case of an agency without 
a website, the agency shall publish the information on the Firstgov.gov 
website or, in the case of any agency with neither a website nor the 
capability to post on the Firstgov.gov website, in the Federal Register; 
and

(vi) The agency Chief FOIA Officer shall ensure that the agency has in 
place a method (or methods), including through the use of the Center, to 
receive and respond promptly and appropriately to inquiries from FOIA 
requesters about the status of their requests. The Chief FOIA Officer shall 
also consider, in consultation with the FOIA Public Liaisons, as 
appropriate, whether the agency's implementation of other means (such as 
tracking numbers for requests, or an agency telephone or Internet hotline) 
would be appropriate for responding to status inquiries.

Sec. 3. Review, Plan, and Report.
    (a) Review. Each agency's Chief FOIA Officer shall conduct a review 
of the agency's FOIA operations to determine whether agency practices 
are consistent with the policies set forth in section 1 of this order. 
In conducting this review, the Chief FOIA Officer shall:

(i) evaluate, with reference to numerical and statistical benchmarks where 
appropriate, the agency's administration of the FOIA, including the 
agency's expenditure of resources on FOIA compliance and the extent to 
which, if any, requests for records have not been responded to within the 
statutory time limit (backlog);

(ii) review the processes and practices by which the agency assists and 
informs the public regarding the FOIA process;

(iii) examine the agency's:

    (A) use of information technology in responding to FOIA 
requests, including without limitation the tracking of FOIA 
requests and communication with requesters;
    (B) practices with respect to requests for expedited 
processing; and
    (C) implementation of multi-track processing if used by such 
agency;

(iv) review the agency's policies and practices relating to the 
availability of public information through websites and other means, 
including the use of websites to make available the records described in 
section 552(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code; and

(v) identify ways to eliminate or reduce its FOIA backlog, consistent with 
available resources and taking into consideration the volume and complexity 
of the FOIA requests pending with the agency.

    (b) Plan.

(i) Each agency's Chief FOIA Officer shall develop, in consultation as 
appropriate with the staff of the agency (including the FOIA Public 
Liaisons), the Attorney General, and the OMB Director, an agency-specific 
plan to ensure that the agency's administration of the FOIA is in 
accordance with applicable law and the policies set forth in section 1 of 
this order. The plan, which shall be submitted to the head of the agency 
for approval, shall address the agency's implementation of the FOIA during 
fiscal years 2006 and 2007.

[[Page 219]]

(ii) The plan shall include specific activities that the agency will 
implement to eliminate or reduce the agency's FOIA backlog, including (as 
applicable) changes that will make the processing of FOIA requests more 
streamlined and effective, as well as increased reliance on the 
dissemination of records that can be made available to the public through a 
website or other means that do not require the public to make a request for 
the records under the FOIA.

(iii) The plan shall also include activities to increase public awareness 
of FOIA processing, including as appropriate, expanded use of the agency's 
Center and its FOIA Public Liaisons.

(iv) The plan shall also include, taking appropriate account of the 
resources available to the agency and the mission of the agency, concrete 
milestones, with specific timetables and outcomes to be achieved, by which 
the head of the agency, after consultation with the OMB Director, shall 
measure and evaluate the agency's success in the implementation of the 
plan.

    (c) Agency Reports to the Attorney General and OMB Director.

(i) The head of each agency shall submit a report, no later than 6 months 
from the date of this order, to the Attorney General and the OMB Director 
that summarizes the results of the review under section 3(a) of this order 
and encloses a copy of the agency's plan under section 3(b) of this order. 
The agency shall publish a copy of the agency's report on the agency's 
website or, in the case of an agency without a website, on the Firstgov.gov 
website, or, in the case of any agency with neither a website nor the 
capability to publish on the Firstgov.gov website, in the Federal Register.

(ii) The head of each agency shall include in the agency's annual FOIA 
reports for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 a report on the agency's development 
and implementation of its plan under section 3(b) of this order and on the 
agency's performance in meeting the milestones set forth in that plan, 
consistent with any related guidelines the Attorney General may issue under 
section 552(e) of title 5, United States Code.

(iii) If the agency does not meet a milestone in its plan, the head of the 
agency shall:

    (A) identify this deficiency in the annual FOIA report to the 
Attorney General;
    (B) explain in the annual report the reasons for the agency's 
failure to meet the milestone;
    (C) outline in the annual report the steps that the agency has 
already taken, and will be taking, to address the deficiency; and
    (D) report this deficiency to the President's Management 
Council.
Sec. 4. Attorney General.
    (a) Report. The Attorney General, using the reports submitted by the 
agencies under subsection 3(c)(i) of this order and the information 
submitted by agencies in their annual FOIA reports for fiscal year 2005, 
shall submit to the President, no later than 10 months from the date of

shall consult the OMB Director in the preparation of the report and 
shall include in the report appropriate recommendations on 
administrative or other agency actions for continued agency 
dissemination and release of

[[Page 220]]

public information. The Attorney General shall thereafter submit two 
further annual reports, by June 1, 2007, and June 1, 2008, that provide 
the President with an update on the agencies' implementation of the FOIA 
and of their plans under section 3(b) of this order.
    (b) Guidance. The Attorney General shall issue such instructions and 
guidance to the heads of departments and agencies as may be appropriate 
to implement sections 3(b) and 3(c) of this order.
Sec. 5. OMB Director. The OMB Director may issue such instructions to 
the heads of agencies as are necessary to implement this order, other 
than sections 3(b) and 3(c) of this order.
Sec. 6. Definitions. As used in this order:
    (a) the term ``agency'' has the same meaning as the term ``agency'' 
under section 552(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code; and

under section 552(f)(2) of title 5, United States Code.

plans under section 3(b) of this order shall be conducted and developed

Notice of January 17, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Terrorists Who 
Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by grave acts of violence 
committed by foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive Order 13099, the 
President modified the Annex to Executive Order 12947 to identify four 
additional persons, including Usama bin Laden, who threaten to disrupt 
the Middle East peace process.
Because these terrorist activities continue to threaten the Middle East 
peace process and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the

[[Page 236]]

national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the

Notice of February 18, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, a national emergency was 
declared to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of 
international relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by 
the Cuban government of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on subsequent 
occasions, the Cuban government stated its intent to forcefully defend 
its sovereignty against any U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft that 
might enter Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a 
flotilla or peaceful protest. Since these events, the Cuban government 
has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the future use of 
reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or aircraft that may 
engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest north of Cuba. On 
February 26, 2004, by Proclamation 7757, the scope of the national 
emergency was expanded in order to deny monetary and material support to 
the repressive Cuban government, which had taken a series of steps to 
destabilize relations with the United States, including threatening to 
abrogate the Migration Accords with the United States and to close the 
United States Interests Section. Further, Cuba's most senior officials 
repeatedly asserted that the United States intended to invade Cuba, 
despite explicit denials from the U.S. Secretaries of State and Defense 
that such action is planned. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency 
authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of 
vessels set out in Proclamation 6867 as amended and expanded by 
Proclamation 7757.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of March 2, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Persons 
Undermining Democratic Processes or Institutions in Zimbabwe

On March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, I declared a national 
emergency blocking the property of persons undermining democratic 
processes or institutions in Zimbabwe, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action 
to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy 
of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of certain 
members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other persons to undermine 
Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions, thus contributing to 
the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, to politically 
motivated violence and intimidation in that country, and to political 
and economic instability in the southern African region.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on March 6, 2003, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond March 6, 2005. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency blocking the property of 
persons undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Iran

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the Government of Iran, including its support for 
international terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace 
process, and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to 
deliver them. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959 
imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further respond to this threat, 
and on August 19, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13059 
consolidating and clarifying the previous orders.

[[Page 241]]

Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on March 15, 1995, must continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2005. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the emergency declared 
by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that 
declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, this renewal is 
distinct from the emergency renewal of November 2004. This notice shall 
be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Secretary of Homeland Security
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws 
of the United States, including section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code:

1. The reporting functions of the President under sections 4026(a)(4)(A), 
4026(c)(2), 7104(e)(4)(A), 7202(d), 7204(c)(1)-(2), and 7119(a) of the

State.

The reporting function under section 7202(d) of the Act on the Human 
Smuggling and Trafficking Center shall be coordinated with the Attorney 
General and the Secretary of Homeland Security.

Heads of departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, 
furnish to the Secretary of State information the Secretary requests to 
perform such functions, in the format and on the schedule specified by the 
Secretary.

2. The reporting function of the President under section 7104(i) of the Act 
is hereby assigned to the Secretary of Defense.

Heads of departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, 
furnish to the Secretary of Defense information the Secretary requests to 
perform such functions, in the format and on the schedule specified by the

3. The reporting functions under sections 1022 and 1094 of the Act are

Effective Dates of Provisions in Title I of the Intelligence Reform and 
Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004

Memorandum for the Secretary of State[,] the Secretary of the 
Treasury[,] the Secretary of Defense[,] the Attorney General[,] the 
Secretary of Energy[,] the Secretary of Homeland Security[,] the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget[, and] the Director of 
National Intelligence
Subsection 1097(a) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention 
Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458, December 17, 2004)(the Act) provides:

(a) IN GENERAL- Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, this 
title and the amendments made by this title shall take effect not later 
than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act.

Subsection 1097(a) clearly contemplates that one or more of the 
provisions in Title I of the Act may take effect earlier than the date 
that is 6 months after the date of enactment of the Act, but does not 
state explicitly the mechanism for determining when such earlier effect 
shall occur, leaving it to the President in the execution of the Act. 
Moreover, given that section 1097(a) evinces a legislative intent to 
afford the President flexibility, and such flexibility is 
constitutionally appropriate with respect to intelligence matters (see 
United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation, 299 U.S. 304 
(1936)), the executive branch shall construe section 1097(a) to 
authorize the President to select different effective dates that precede 
the 6-month deadline for different provisions in Title I.
Therefore, pursuant to the Constitution and the laws of the United 
States of America, including subsection 1097(a) of the Act, I hereby 
determine and direct:

1. Sections 1097(a) and 1103 of the Act, relating respectively to effective 
dates of provisions and to severability, shall take effect immediately upon 
the signing of this memorandum to any extent that they have not already 
taken effect.

2. Provisions in Title I of the Act other than those addressed in numbered 
paragraph 1 of this memorandum shall take effect immediately upon the 
signing of this memorandum, except:

(a) any provision in Title I of the Act for which the Act expressly 
provides the date on which the provision shall take effect; and

(b) sections 1021 and 1092 of the Act, relating to the National 
Counterterrorism Center.

[[Page 245]]

The taking of effect of a provision pursuant to section 1097(a) of the 
Act and this memorandum shall not affect the construction of such 
provision by the executive branch as set forth in my Statement of 
December 17, 2004, upon signing the Act into law.
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and 
directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Certain 
Persons and Prohibiting the Export of Certain Goods to Syria

On May 11, 2004, pursuant to my authority under the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) and the Syria 
Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003 (Public 
Law 108-175), I issued Executive Order 13338 in which I declared a 
national emergency blocking the property of certain persons and 
prohibiting the exportation or reexportation of certain goods to Syria. 
I took this action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions of the Government of Syria in supporting 
terrorism, continuing its occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of 
mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining United States and 
international efforts with respect to the stabilization and 
reconstruction of Iraq.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Syria continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States, the national emergency 
declared on May 11, 2004, and the measures adopted on that date to deal 
with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond May 11, 2005. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency blocking the property of certain persons and prohibiting the 
exportation or reexportation of certain goods to Syria.

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Burma

On May 20, 1997, the President issued Executive Order 13047, certifying 
to the Congress under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 
104-208), that the Government of Burma has committed large-scale 
repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 
1996, thereby invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by 
United States persons contained in that section. The President also 
declared a national emergency to deal with the threat posed to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States by the actions 
and policies of the Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter 
alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 
et seq. On July 28, 2003, I issued Executive Order 13310 taking 
additional steps with respect to that national emergency by putting in 
place an import ban required by the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of

dealing in property in which certain designated Burmese persons have an 
interest.

[[Page 249]]

Because the actions and policies of the Government of Burma continue to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and 
foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency declared on 
May 20, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that 
emergency must continue in effect beyond May 20, 2005. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to Burma. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register

Notice of May 19, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency Protecting the Development Fund 
for Iraq and Certain Other Property in Which Iraq has an Interest

On May 22, 2003, by Executive Order 13303, I declared a national 
emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other 
property in which Iraq has an interest, pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) (IEEPA). I took this 
action to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the obstacles 
to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance 
of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq constituted by the 
threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Development 
Fund for Iraq, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests 
therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any 
nature whatsoever arising from or related to the sale or marketing 
thereof.
On August 28, 2003, in Executive Order 13315, I expanded the scope of 
this national emergency to block the property of the former Iraqi 
regime, its senior officials and their family members as the removal of 
Iraqi property from that country by certain senior officials of the 
former Iraqi regime and their immediate family members constitutes an 
obstacle to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and 
maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of 
political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq.
On July 29, 2004, in Executive Order 13350, I amended the Annex to 
Executive Order 13315 to include certain persons determined to have been 
subject to economic sanctions pursuant to Executive Orders 12722 and 
12724. Because of their association with the prior Iraqi regime, I 
determined that these persons present an obstacle to the orderly 
reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and 
security in that country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq and, therefore, such 
persons should be subject to sanctions under Executive Order 13315.

[[Page 250]]

Executive Order 13350 also amended Executive Order 13290 of March 20, 
2003, in which, consistent with section 203(a)(1)(C) of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. 
1702(a)(1)(C), I ordered that certain blocked funds held in the United 
States in accounts in the name of the Government of Iraq, the Central 
Bank of Iraq, Rafidain Bank, Rasheed Bank, or the State Organization for 
Marketing Oil be confiscated and vested in the Department of the 
Treasury. I originally exercised these authorities pursuant to Executive 
Order 12722. In light of the changed circumstances in Iraq and my 
decision to terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 
12722, I determined that the exercise of authorities in Executive Order 
13290 should continue in order to address the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22, 2003, as expanded in scope 
in Executive Order 13315 of August 28, 2003, regarding the obstacles 
posed to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq. Executive Order 13350 
amends Executive Order 13290 to that effect.
On November 29, 2004, in Executive Order 13364, I modified the scope of 
this national emergency to address the unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed 
by the threat of attachment or other judicial process against the 
Central Bank of Iraq. I also determined that, consistent with United 
Nations Security Council Resolutions 1483 and 1546, the steps taken in 
Executive Order 13303 to deal with this national emergency need to be 
limited so that such steps do not apply with respect to any final 
judgment arising out of a contractual obligation entered into by the 
Government of Iraq, including any agency or instrumentality thereof, 
after June 30, 2004, and so that, with respect to Iraqi petroleum and 
petroleum products and interests therein, such steps shall apply only 
until title passes to the initial purchaser.
Because the obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the 
restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and 
the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions 
in Iraq continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States, the national 
emergency declared on May 22, 2003, and the measures adopted on that 
date, August 28, 2003, July 29, 2004, and November 29, 2004, to deal 
with that emergency must continue in effect beyond May 22, 2005. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency protecting the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other 
property in which Iraq has an interest.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of June 17, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Risk of 
Nuclear Proliferation Created by the Accumulation of Weapons-Usable 
Fissile Material in the Territory of the Russian Federation

On June 21, 2000, the President issued Executive Order 13159 (the 
``Order'') blocking property and interests in property of the Government 
of the Russian Federation that are in the United States, that hereafter 
come within the United States, or that are or hereinafter come within 
the possession or control of United States persons that are directly 
related to the implementation of the Agreement Between the Government of 
the United States of America and the Government of the Russian 
Federation Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium 
Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, dated February 18, 1993, and related 
contracts and agreements (collectively, the ``HEU Agreements''). The HEU 
Agreements allow

[[Page 253]]

for the downblending of highly enriched uranium derived from nuclear 
weapons to low enriched uranium for peaceful commercial purposes. The 
Order invoked the authority, inter alia, of the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq., and declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the 
risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of a large 
volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the 
Russian Federation.
The national emergency declared on June 21, 2000, must continue beyond 
June 21, 2005, to provide continued protection from attachment, 
judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial 
process for the property and interests in property of the Government of 
the Russian Federation that are directly related to the implementation 
of the HEU Agreements and subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with 
respect to weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the 
Russian Federation. This notice shall be published in the Federal 
Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of June 23, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to the Western 
Balkans

On June 26, 2001, by Executive Order 13219, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the Western Balkans pursuant to the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to 
deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of 
persons engaged in, or assisting, sponsoring, or supporting (i) 
extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia, and elsewhere in the 
Western Balkans region, or (ii) acts obstructing implementation of the 
Dayton Accords in Bosnia or United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1244 of June 10, 1999, in Kosovo. Subsequent to the declaration of the 
national emergency, the actions of persons obstructing implementation of 
the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 2001 in Macedonia also became a 
pressing concern. I amended Executive Order 13219 on May 28, 2003, in 
Executive Order 13304 to address this concern and to take additional 
steps with respect to the national emergency. Because the actions of 
persons threatening the peace and international stabilization efforts in 
the Western Balkans continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures adopted 
on that date and thereafter to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond June 26, 2005. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to the Western 
Balkans.

Notice of July 19, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency Blocking Property of Certain 
Persons and Prohibiting the Importation of Certain Goods From Liberia

On July 22, 2004, by Executive Order 13348, I declared a national 
emergency and ordered related measures blocking the property of certain 
persons and prohibiting the importation of certain goods from Liberia, 
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of former Liberian President 
Charles Taylor and other persons, in particular their unlawful depletion 
of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of 
Liberian funds and property, which have undermined Liberia's transition 
to democracy and the orderly development of its political, 
administrative, and economic institutions and resources. I further noted 
that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed on August 18, 2003, and 
the related cease-fire have not yet been universally implemented 
throughout Liberia, and that the illicit trade in round logs and timber 
products is linked to the proliferation of and trafficking in illegal 
arms, which perpetuate the Liberian conflict and fuel and exacerbate 
other conflicts throughout West Africa.
Because the actions and policies of these persons continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United 
States, the national emergency declared on July 22, 2004, and the 
measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, must continue 
in effect beyond July 22, 2005. Therefore, in accordance with section

Continuation of U.S. Drug Interdiction Assistance to the Government of 
Colombia

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1012 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, as amended (22 U.S.C. 
2291-4), I hereby certify, with respect to Colombia, that (1) 
interdiction of aircraft reasonably suspected to be primarily engaged in 
illicit drug trafficking in that country's airspace is necessary because 
of the extraordinary threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the 
national security of that country; and (2) that country has appropriate 
procedures in place to protect against innocent loss of life in the air 
and on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which shall at a 
minimum include effective means to identify and warn an aircraft before 
the use of force is directed against the aircraft.
The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this 
determination in the Federal Register and to notify the Congress of this 
determination.

Notice of September 8, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Certain Terrorist 
Attacks

Consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency I 
declared on September 14, 2001, in Proclamation 7463, with respect to 
the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and 
the Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks 
on the United States.
By Executive Order 13223 of September 14, 2001 and Executive Order 13253 
of January 16, 2002, I delegated authority to the Secretary of Defense 
and the Secretary of Transportation to order members of the Reserve 
Components to active duty and to waive certain statutory military 
personnel requirements. By Executive Order 13235 of November 16, 2001, I 
delegated authority to the Secretary of Defense to exercise certain 
emergency construction authority. By Executive Order 13286 of February 
28, 2003, I transferred the authority delegated to the Secretary of 
Transportation in Executive Order 13223 to the Secretary of Homeland 
Security.
Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency declared 
on September 14, 2001, and the measures taken on September 14, 2001, 
November 16, 2001, and January 16, 2002, to deal with that emergency, 
must continue in effect beyond September 14, 2005. Therefore, I am 
continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency I 
declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist threat. 
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 2005-36 of September 14, 2005

Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug 
Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2006

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the 
following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug 
producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, 
Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, 
Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.
A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse 
reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of 
cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory 
definition of a major drug-transit or drug-producing country set fourth 
in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit 
drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of 
geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to 
transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous 
enforcement measures.
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designated Burma and 
Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 
12 months to adhere to their obligations under international 
counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set fourth in section 
489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report (Tab A) are justifications 
for the determinations on Burma and Venezuela, as required by section 
706(2)(B).
I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 
706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for program to aid Venezuela's 
democratic institutions, establish selected community development 
projects, and strengthen Venezuela's political party system is vital to 
the national interests of the United States.
I have removed China and Vietnam from the list of major drug transit or 
major illicit drug producing countries because there is insufficient 
evidence to suggest that China is a major source zone or transit country 
for illicit narcotics that significantly affects the United States. 
There is insufficient

[[Page 266]]

evidence to refute claims by the Government of Vietnam that they have 
virtually eliminated opium poppy production. Additionally, although 
cooperation with United States law enforcement is limited, there are no 
indications of a significant Vietnam-based drug threat to the United 
States.
Despite the Government of Afghanistan's counternarcotics efforts, we 
remain concerned about the disturbing magnitude of the drug trade and 
the prospect that opium poppy cultivation will likely increase in 2006. 
We are also concerned about government corruption, especially at the 
regional and local levels, impending counternarcotics efforts. For these 
efforts to be effective, government corruption with respect to the opium 
economy must be seriously addressed--by both local and central 
government authorities.
The Government of Canada has made real progress in curbing the diversion 
into the United States of pseudoephedrine, which fuels the production of 
methamphetamine. There are indications, however, that Canadian-based 
criminal groups are increasingly involved in the production of MDMA 
(Ecstasy) destined for the United States. Large scale cross-border 
trafficking of Canadian-grown marijuana remains a serious concern. The 
United States appreciates the excellent law enforcement cooperation with 
Canada in combating these shared threats.
While Haiti made efforts this year to improve its performance, we 
reiterate our concerns from last year about the Interim Government of 
Haiti's inability to effectively organize Haitian law enforcement 
resources to permit sustained counternarcotics efforts. Further, the 
national criminal justice system must be significantly strengthened in 
order to be effective and gain public confidence.
The Government of The Netherlands has achieved considerable success in 
countering the production and flow of MDMA (Ecstasy) to the United 
States, and The Netherlands is commended for its enhanced efforts. In 
the coming year, the United States would like to build upon our law 
enforcement cooperation with the Dutch government through advancements 
in mutual legal assistance and direct engagement between our respective 
police agencies.
Drug trafficking, money laundering, and other organized criminal 
activity in Nigeria remain major sources of concern to the United 
States. Progress over the past year on anti-money laundering controls is 
welcome, but much remains to be done to make such controls effective. 
Implementing anti-corruption policies must advance more quickly, as 
corruption at all levels of government continues to hamper effective 
narcotics law enforcement. In addition, measures similar to those taken 
to improve drug law enforcement at Nigeria's main airport need to be 
expanded to, and replicated at, Nigeria's seaports, where drug 
trafficking is a growing concern. Finally, the National Drug Law 
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and other counternarcotics institutions 
should work towards developing the mindset and capacity to pursue 
investigations, and prosecutions of major drug traffickers based in the 
country.
We remain concerned with the continued involvement by the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in criminal activity, including drug 
production and drug trafficking. Given the close relationship between 
Japanese and Chinese criminal elements and DPRK drug traffickers in past 
smuggling incidents, there is a real possibility of continuing DPRK 
involvement

[[Page 267]]

in drug trafficking, even when a given incident appears only to involve 
ethnic Chinese or other organized Asian criminal groups.
You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this determination to 
the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.

Notice of September 21, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Persons Who 
Commit, Threaten To Commit, or Support Terrorism

On September 23, 2001, by Executive Order 13224, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or 
support terrorism, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706). I took this action to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the grave acts 
of terrorism and threats of terrorism committed by foreign terrorists, 
including the terrorist attacks in New York, in Pennsylvania, and 
against the Pentagon committed on September 11, 2001, and the continuing 
and immediate threat of further attacks against United States nationals 
or the United States. Because the actions of these persons who commit, 
threaten to commit, or support terrorism continue to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the United States, the national emergency 
declared on September 23, 2001, and the measures adopted on that date to 
deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 23, 
2005. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to 
commit, or support terrorism.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of October 19, 2005

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Significant 
Narcotics Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, the President declared a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States constituted by the actions of significant 
narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, and the extreme level of 
violence, corruption, and harm such actions cause in the United States 
and abroad.
The order blocks all property and interests in property of foreign 
persons listed in an annex to the order that are in the United States or 
within the possession or control of U.S. persons, as well as of foreign 
persons determined to play a significant role in international narcotics 
trafficking centered in Colombia. The order similarly blocks all 
property and interests in property of foreign persons determined to 
materially assist in, or provide financial or technological support for 
or goods or services in support of, the narcotics trafficking activities 
of persons designated in or pursuant to the order, or persons determined 
to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, persons 
designated in or pursuant to the order. The order also prohibits any 
transaction or dealing by United States persons or within the United 
States in such property or interests in property.
Because the actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in 
Colombia continue to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States and to cause an extreme level of violence, 
corruption,

[[Page 274]]

and harm in the United States and abroad, the national emergency 
declared on October 21, 1995, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto 
to deal with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond October 21, 
2005. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the 
national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers 
centered in Colombia. This notice shall be published in the Federal 
Register and transmitted to the Congress.

101(a)(42), respectively, of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and 
Determination Pursuant to Section 2(b)(2) of the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Act, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
In accordance with Section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(the ``Act'') (8 U.S.C. 1157), as amended, and after appropriate 
consultations with the Congress, I hereby make the following 
determinations and authorize the following actions:
The admission of up to 70,000 refugees to the United States during FY 
2006 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the 
national interest; provided, however, that this number shall be 
understood as including persons admitted to the United States during FY 
2006 with Federal refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian 
immigrant admissions program, as provided below.
The 70,000 admissions numbers shall be allocated among refugees of 
special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the 
following regional allocations; provided, however, that the number 
allocated to the East Asia region shall include persons admitted to the 
United States during FY 2006 with Federal refugee resettlement 
assistance under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988, as contained 
in section 101(e) of Public Law 100-202 (Amerasian immigrants and their 
family members); provided further that the number allocated to the 
former Soviet Union shall include persons admitted who were nationals of 
the former Soviet Union, or in the case of persons having no 
nationality, who were habitual residents of the former Soviet Union, 
prior to September 2, 1991:


[[Page 275]]



 
 
 
Africa                                     20,000
East Asia                                  15,000

Unallocated Reserve                        10,000
 


The 10,000 unallocated refugee numbers shall be allocated to regional 
ceilings as needed. Upon providing notification to the Judiciary 
Committees of the Congress, you are hereby authorized to use unallocated 
numbers in regions where the need for additional numbers arises.
Additionally, upon notification to the Judiciary Committees of the 
Congress, you are further authorized to transfer unused admission 
numbers allocated to a particular region to one or more other regions, 
if there is a need for greater numbers for the region or regions to 
which the numbers are being transferred. Consistent with section 2(b)(2) 
of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962, as amended, I 
hereby determine that assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for 
admission to the United States as part of the overseas refugee 
admissions program will contribute to the foreign policy interests of 
the United States and designate such persons for this purpose.
Consistent with section 101(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)) and 
after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I also specify that, 
for FY 2006, the following persons may, if otherwise qualified, be 
considered refugees for the purpose of admission to the United States 
within their countries of nationality or habitual residence:
                                                                      a.
    Persons in Vietnam
                                                                      b.

                                                                      c.
    Persons in the former Soviet Union
                                                                      d.

Notice of October 25, 2005

Continuation of National Emergency Regarding the Proliferation of 
Weapons of Mass Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, President Clinton 
declared a national emergency with respect to the unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, 
biological, and chemical weapons (weapons of mass destruction) and the 
means of delivering such weapons. On July 28, 1998, the President issued 
Executive Order 13094 amending Executive Order 12938 to respond more 
effectively to the worldwide

[[Page 276]]

threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation activities. On June 
28, 2005, I issued Executive Order 13382 which, inter alia, further 
amended Executive Order 12938 to improve our ability to combat 
proliferation. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
and the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States, the national emergency first declared on 
November 14, 1994, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2005. In 
accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 12938, as amended.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan

On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Sudan pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of 
the Government of Sudan. Because the actions and policies of the 
Government of Sudan continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, the 
national emergency declared on November 3, 1997, and the measures 
adopted on that date to deal with that emergency must continue in effect 
beyond November 3, 2005. Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of 
the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 
year the national emergency with respect to Sudan.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted

On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a 
national emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International 
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the 
unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation in 
Iran. Because our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal, 
and the process of implementing the January 19, 1981, agreements with 
Iran is still underway, the national emergency declared on November 14, 
1979, must continue in effect beyond November 14, 2005. Therefore, 
consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year this national emergency with 
respect to Iran.

Memorandum of November 10, 2005

Determinations Under Section 1106(a) of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988--Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

Memorandum for the United States Trade Representative
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia) is seeking to become a Member 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Saudi Arabia has concluded a 
bilateral agreement with the United States related to Saudi Arabia's 
accession to the WTO. Saudi Arabia's commitments under this bilateral 
agreement with the United States ensure: (1) that all state trading 
enterprises, as defined in section 1107(6) of the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the ``Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2906(6)), will make 
(a) purchases that are not for government use and (b) sales in 
international trade, in accordance with commercial considerations, 
including price, quality, availability, marketability, and 
transportation, and (2) that such state trading enterprises will afford 
U.S. business firms adequate opportunity, in accordance with customary 
practice, to compete for such purchases and sales.
In accordance with section 1106(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2905(a)(1)), 
I determine that state trading enterprises account for a significant 
share of the exports of Saudi Arabia and the goods that compete with 
imports into Saudi Arabia. Further, I determine that, based on the 
bilateral agreement that Saudi Arabia has entered into with the United 
States, information provided and commitments set forth in the Report of 
the Working Party on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Accession to the WTO, 
and other information considered in connection with Saudi Arabia's WTO 
accession negotiations including information in the United States 
National Energy Policy report, an affirmative determination under 
section 1106(a)(2) is not warranted.
The determinations under section 1106(a) are intended solely to further 
the purpose of section 1106 and are not determinative for the purpose of 
any other statute or regulation.
You are directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 2006-7 of December 30, 2005

Presidential Determination on Imports of Circular Welded Non-Alloy Steel 
Pipe from the People's Republic of China

Memorandum for the Secretary of Commerce[,] the Secretary of Labor[,and] 
the United States Trade Representative
Pursuant to section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
2451), I have determined the action I will take with respect to the 
affirmative determination of the United States International Trade 
Commission (USITC) regarding imports of circular welded non-alloy steel 
pipe (steel pipe) from China (Investigation No. TA-421-6). After 
considering all relevant aspects of the investigation, I have determined 
that providing import relief for the U.S. steel pipe industry is not in 
the national economic interest of the United States. In particular, I 
find that the import relief would have an adverse impact on the United 
States economy clearly greater than the benefits of such action.
The facts of this case indicate that any import relief, including either 
of the USITC's proposed remedies, is likely to be ineffective because of 
the extent to which imports from third countries would likely replace 
curtailed Chinese imports. A large number of third countries--the USITC 
documents more than 50 of them--supply the U.S. market with steel pipe. 
Although antidumping duties currently apply to imports from eight of 
those countries, there are many other countries currently supplying 
steel pipe to the

[[Page 284]]

U.S. market that could fill the void created by curtailed Chinese 
imports. Under these circumstances, import relief would likely not 
provide a meaningful benefit to domestic producers.
In addition, imposing import relief would cost U.S. consumers 
substantially more than the increased income that could be realized by 
domestic producers. According to USITC estimates, the USITC's 
recommended quota remedy would generate costs for U.S. consumers five 
times greater than the additional income that could be realized by 
domestic producers. Under the USITC's recommended tariff rate quota 
remedy, the costs would be four times greater than the income generated 
by domestic producers.
While the particular circumstances of this case make clear that the U.S. 
national economic interest would not be served by the imposition of 
import relief under section 421, I remain fully committed to exercising 
the important authority granted to me under section 421 when the 
circumstances of a particular case warrant it.
I hereby direct the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor to 
expedite consideration of any Trade Adjustment Assistance applications 
received from domestic producers or their workers, consistent with their 
statutory mandates.
The United States Trade Representative is authorized and directed to 
publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

<R05>
Sec.  102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec.  102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.

<R05>
Sec.  102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec.  102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 293]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec.  102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall 
give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals 
with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic 
property is not required because of Sec.  102.150(a) (2) or (3), 
alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the

Sec.  102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

Sec.  102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec.  102.160 would 
result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would 
result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or 
his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for 
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity 
and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for 
reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this 
section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency 
shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration 
or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum 
extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and 
services of the program or activity.

section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures 
established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR 
part 1613 pursuant to section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
U.S.C. 791).

at the following address: Room 486, Old Executive Office Building, 17th 
and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Washington, DC 20500.
    (d) The agency shall accept and investigate all complete complaints 
for which it has jurisdiction. All complete complaints must be filed

extend this time period for good cause.

[[Page 295]]

jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make 
reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government 
entity.
    (f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation 
Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a 
building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act 
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to 
and usable by individuals with handicaps.
    (g) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which

extend this time for good cause.
    (i) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the head of 
the agency.
    (j) The head of the agency shall notify the complainant of the 
results of the appeal within 60 days of the receipt of the request. If 
the head of the agency determines that additional information is needed 
from the complainant, he or she shall have 60 days from the date of 
receipt of the additional information to make his or her determination 
on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
    (l) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint
