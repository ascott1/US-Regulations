                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

                        Explanation of This Title


<R03>
    This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of 
Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the 
Executive Office of the President.

    The 1999 Compilation contains the full text of those documents 
signed by the President that were required to be published in the 
Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the 
criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential 
documents signed in the previous year become the new Compilation.

    Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the 
President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, 
in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are 
updated by individual issues of the Federal Register.

    Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 1999 
Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 7162 
appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 1999 Comp., p. 1.'' 
Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred 
abbreviated citation for Section 100.1, appearing in Chapter I of this 
book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.''

    This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with 
Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 
13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations 
and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 
2000, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv.

    For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior 
to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive 
Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified 
Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential 
Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). 
Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the 
Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and 
statements, can be found in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential 
Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. Each of these 
Office of the Federal Register publications is available for sale from 
the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, 
DC 20402.

    This book was prepared in the Presidential Documents and Legislative 
Division by Anna Glover and Karen A. Thornton, with the assistance of 
John S. Ashlin, Karen L. Ashlin, and Jennifer S. Mangum.

Proclamation 7162 of January 14, 1999

Religious Freedom Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

On Religious Freedom Day we commemorate a landmark achievement in the 
history of our Nation: the adoption in 1786 by the Virginia legislature 
of a religious freedom statute. This historic legislation, drafted by 
Thomas Jefferson and co-sponsored by James Madison, was designed to 
prevent religious discrimination and to protect Virginians from pressure 
to join or support any church. It served as the model for the First 
Amendment of our Constitution, the guarantee of freedom of religion that 
has beckoned so many people fleeing persecution to seek sanctuary in 
this land.
Americans are a deeply religious people, and our right to worship as we 
choose, to follow our own personal beliefs, is the source of much of our 
Nation's strength. Our churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and other 
houses of worship are centers of community service and community life. 
They preserve and promote the values and religious traditions that have 
infused our efforts to build a civil society based on mutual respect, 
compassion, and generosity. They provide our children with the moral 
compass to make wise choices.
America's reverence for religious freedom and religious tolerance has 
saved us from much of the hatred and violence that have plagued so many 
other peoples around the world. We have always been vigilant in 
protecting this freedom, but our efforts cannot stop at our own shores. 
We cannot ignore the suffering of men and women across the globe today 
who are harassed, imprisoned, tortured, and executed simply for seeking 
to live by their own beliefs. Freedom of religion is a fundamental human 
right that must be upheld by every nation and guaranteed by every 
government. The pro

[[Page 2]]

motion of religious freedom for all peoples must continue to serve as a 
central element of our foreign policy.
Reflecting our steadfast commitment to this goal, last fall the Congress 
passed, and I was proud to sign into law, the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998. This legislation enhances our ability to advance 
freedom of religion for men and women of all faiths throughout the 
world. It also establishes a new position at the Department of State--
the Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom--to ensure 
that religious liberty concerns receive consistent and appropriate 
attention at the highest policymaking levels.
On Religious Freedom Day, let us give thanks for this precious right 
that has so profoundly shaped and sustained our Nation, and let us 
strengthen our efforts to share its blessings with oppressed peoples 
everywhere.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 1999, as 
Religious Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs, 
and I urge all Americans to reaffirm their devotion to the fundamental 
principles of religious freedom and religious tolerance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7163 of January 15, 1999

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

January 15 would have marked the 70th birthday of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., a man of great vision and moral purpose whose dream for our 
Nation set into motion such powerful, sweeping changes that their impact 
is still being felt today. While he was taken from us too soon, we still 
have with us the gifts of his vision, convictions, eloquence, and 
example. We still hear the echo of his voice telling us that ``Life's 
most persistent and urgent question is, `What are you doing for 
others?'''
We know what Dr. King did for others. He energized and mobilized a 
generation of Americans, black and white, to join in the struggle for 
civil rights, to respond to violence, hatred, and unjust incarceration 
with the spirit of peace, love, and righteousness. He taught us that we 
could not claim America as the land of justice, freedom, and equality as 
long as millions of our citizens continually and systematically faced 
discriminatory and oppressive treatment. He challenged us to recognize 
that the fundamental rights of all Americans are forever interconnected, 
for ``we are

[[Page 3]]

caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment 
of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.''
Martin Luther King, Jr., awakened America's conscience to the immorality 
of racism. He was the driving force behind the passage of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing 
Act of 1968. For African Americans, this landmark legislation meant that 
the opportunity for a quality education would no longer be impossible, 
the levers of the voting booth would no longer be out of reach, and the 
purchase of a dream home would no longer be unattainable. Millions of 
Americans--of every race and background and culture--live brighter lives 
today because of Martin Luther King, Jr.
Dr. King's dream of unity for America did not die with him. Today, as 
our Nation becomes increasingly multiracial and multiethnic, his 
compelling vision is more important than ever, and the means for 
realizing it are now within our reach. This past year, as part of my 
Initiative on Race, Americans across the country participated in 
thousands of honest and open conversations about race in a sincere 
effort to heal our divisions and move toward genuine reconciliation. We 
learned much about the roots of prejudice; but more important, we 
learned much about how to overcome it. In community after community, in 
every field of endeavor from sports and education to business and 
religion, we discovered organizations and programs that have succeeded 
in bridging gaps between people of different races and cultures. These 
promising practices offer us both realistic guidelines for everyday 
action and genuine hope that we can respect one another's differences 
and embrace the values that unite us.
Now it is our turn to answer the question, ``What are you doing for 
others?'' As part of our response, each year since 1994 we have made the 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday a national day of service, a 
day on which to honor Dr. King's legacy through service projects across 
our country. Instead of taking a day off, millions of our fellow 
Americans respond to the needs of their communities, through activities 
like tutoring children, sheltering the homeless, making schoolyards 
safer, or making public parks more inviting.
Let us make this year's observance the beginning of a broader effort to 
improve our communities and the lives of our fellow Americans, to make 
the personal choices and take the personal actions that will bridge the 
gaps--racial and otherwise--that keep us from becoming the people we 
were meant to be. Working together, joining our hearts and our hands, we 
will succeed in building One America for the 21st century and in 
fulfilling the dream of Martin Luther King, Jr.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 18, 1999, 
as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I call upon all 
Americans to observe this occasion and to honor Dr. King's legacy with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and

[[Page 4]]

of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7164 of January 29, 1999

National Consumer Protection Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Consumers are too often the target of unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent 
practices. Modern advances in telecommunications and marketing 
technology have dramatically increased both the sophistication and the 
potential threat of such practices. Perpetrators of fraud can reach 
consumers across the country through the Internet, on television, the 
telephone, or by direct mail, misrepresenting themselves as legitimate 
business people. Because their proposals appear legitimate, these 
unscrupulous operators frequently succeed in cheating vulnerable 
consumers out of hard-earned dollars.
One of the most damaging fraudulent practices is credit fraud. Credit 
fraud--stealing credit cards or credit identities and cheating consumers 
through deceptive or abusive lending practices--can be difficult to 
recognize. Fraudulent credit transactions are often complicated and can 
occur when perpetrators hide or fail to disclose essential information 
to consumers. By stealing consumers' credit identities, criminals can 
run up huge debts and ruin their victims' credit records. And credit 
fraud costs all of us in higher interest rates and fees.
The best defense we have against credit fraud is education. The Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC), the National Association of Consumer Agency 
Administrators, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the American 
Association of Retired Persons, the National Consumers League, the 
Consumer Federation of America, and the National Association of 
Attorneys General are working in partnership to inform Americans about 
the dangers of credit fraud. As part of this effort, the FTC and its 
partners offer information on-line, by telephone, and in writing to 
alert consumers about the warning signs of credit fraud and how to 
protect themselves against it. The FTC, in cooperation with State 
Attorneys General and the Internal Revenue Service, is also actively 
prosecuting credit fraud cases that target some of our most vulnerable 
citizens.
I encourage all Americans to learn more about credit fraud, to read 
their credit reports carefully, to protect such personal information as 
their bank account, credit card, and Social Security numbers, and to 
know how to recognize the characteristics of fraudulent proposals. By 
using credit wisely and remaining alert to the possibility of credit 
fraud, we can better protect the well-being of our families and preserve 
our financial health and security.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 31

[[Page 5]]

through February 6, 1999, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call 
upon government officials, industry leaders, consumer advocates, and the 
American people to participate in programs that foster credit literacy 
and raise public awareness about the dangers of credit fraud and other 
deceptive and fraudulent practices.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

Proclamation 7165 of February 1, 1999

National African American History Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The story of African Americans is one of strength, suffering, courage, 
and triumph. Arriving on these shores more than 350 years ago, African 
Americans have been a central element of our national identity, and 
their long journey from the horrors of slavery and oppression through 
the struggle for equality and justice informs our national experience. 
By observing African American History Month each year, we not only 
remember the tragic errors of our past, but also celebrate the 
achievements of African Americans and the promise they hold for our 
future as one America.
This year's theme, ``The Legacy of African American Leadership for the 
Present and the Future,'' is a recognition that we can draw strength and 
inspiration to face our challenges from the vision, voices, character, 
and accomplishments of the many extraordinary African Americans who have 
gone before us. These gifted men and women, from every walk of life and 
every field of endeavor, were shaped but not defeated by their 
experience of racism, and their response was to move our Nation closer 
to our ideals of freedom, justice, and equality.
We remember Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, whose powerful 
firsthand accounts of their lives as slaves and the moral strength of 
their argument helped create the momentum that brought an end to slavery 
in America. In our own century, we all have benefited from the skills, 
determination, and indefatigable spirit of such African American leaders 
as Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois, A. Philip Randolph, Ella Baker, 
Thurgood Marshall, Medgar Evers, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Whether 
organizing peaceful demonstrations, creating educational and economic 
opportunities, fighting Jim Crow laws in the courts, or conducting 
peaceful protests, they awakened the conscience of our Nation and won 
signal victories for justice and human dignity. We recall the courage of 
the Little Rock Nine, who opened the doors of American education for so 
many other deserving young people. We remember the strength of Rosa 
Parks, who stood up for civil rights by sitting down where she belonged. 
We continue to draw inspiration from the leadership of Dorothy Height, 
who has done

[[Page 6]]

so much to strengthen families and communities not only in our own 
Nation, but also around the world.
These and so many other African American leaders have enriched our 
national life and shaped our national character. They have challenged us 
to recognize that America's racial, cultural, and ethnic diversity will 
be among our greatest strengths in the 21st century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 1999 as National 
African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this 
month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs that raise 
awareness and appreciation of African American history.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7166 of February 3, 1999

American Heart Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Thanks to the dedicated efforts of scientists and researchers and the 
strong support of the American public, today we stand at the threshold 
of a new frontier in the prevention and treatment of heart disease. And 
in coming years, Americans will reap even greater benefits from our 
ongoing commitment to heart research.
Already, research has profoundly altered scientists' understanding of 
heart disease, revealing that the likelihood of heart disease is 
increased by risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, high 
blood cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, physical inactivity, and a family 
history of early heart disease. Armed with this knowledge, millions of 
Americans have been able to take steps to reduce their risk of illness. 
Thanks to scientific discoveries, those already afflicted with heart 
disease now have access to lifesaving therapies and procedures such as 
clot-dissolving drugs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation, 
and balloon angioplasty.
Even greater advances lie ahead. Fields on the verge of delivering major 
innovations include molecular genetics, gene therapy, biotechnology, 
immunology, and epidemiology. The next breakthroughs will include better 
noninvasive diagnostic tools that can help physicians examine the heart 
and blood vessels without surgery; an implantable mechanical device that 
can restore heart function to those suffering heart failure; and a drug 
that can promote the growth of new blood vessels to body tissues and 
organs with poor circulation.

[[Page 7]]

But technology is not a panacea. Despite the great gains we have made, 
heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, 
and millions of Americans have at least one risk factor for heart 
disease. Moreover, recent data have shown a slight rise in the death 
rate for stroke and a slowing in the decline of the death rate for 
coronary heart disease. Some cardiovascular conditions, such as heart 
failure, as well as two key heart disease risk factors, obesity and 
physical inactivity, are on the increase among Americans.
We must work together to make all Americans aware of the information 
science has given us regarding controllable risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease. It is particularly important that we reach out 
to African Americans, Hispanic Americans, other minority communities, 
and women, who often are at high risk for heart disease and stroke, and 
ensure that they have access to the resources and information they need 
to guard against these afflictions. We must also encourage families to 
teach their children the importance of adopting healthy lifestyle 
practices early and maintaining them into and throughout adulthood.
The Federal Government continues to play a vital role in improving the 
cardiovascular health of Americans by supporting research and public 
education through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the 
National Institutes of Health. The American Heart Association, through 
its research and education programs and its broad network of dedicated 
volunteers, also plays a crucial part in bringing about much-needed 
advances.
As Americans look ahead to a new century and a new millennium, we should 
use the momentum of past heart research as a springboard to even greater 
gains. In recognition of the importance of the ongoing fight against 
cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved 
December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 169b), has requested that the 
President issue an annual proclamation designating February as 
``American Heart Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim February 1999 as American Heart Month. I 
invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, and the American people to join me in reaffirming our commitment 
to combating cardiovascular disease and stroke.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7167 of February 7, 1999

Death of King Hussein

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Today the world mourns one of its great leaders. A man of principle, a 
powerful force for good, His Majesty King Hussein was the embodiment of 
courage, dignity, and wisdom. Steadfast in his support for Middle East 
peace, he was admired by Americans and beloved by his country. King 
Hussein was an extraordinary statesman and a true friend of the United 
States.
As a mark of respect for the memory of King Hussein, I hereby order, by 
the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws 
of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States 
shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at 
all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the 
Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United 
States and its Territories and possessions until his interment. I also 
direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff during this same 
period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and 
other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval 
vessels and stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

Proclamation 7168 of February 25, 1999

American Red Cross Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For almost 120 years, the American Red Cross has served as a beacon of 
hope to those in need. Reaching out to victims of disaster, generations 
of Red Cross volunteers have provided shelter, food, and other essential 
services to relieve the sufferings of families and communities and help 
people begin the process of rebuilding their lives. Today more than a 
million dedicated men and women volunteer under the banner of the 
American Red Cross, upholding this extraordinary tradition of service 
and assisting people across our Nation and around the world to prevent, 
prepare for, and respond to emergencies.
The strength and scope of the natural disasters that occurred during 
1998 made this past year among the most devastating in recent history. 
Floods, tornadoes, winter storms, and wildfires ravaged communities 
across the Nation. Hurricanes Georges and Mitch caused record 
destruction in the Gulf States and Central America. In total, the 
American Red Cross responded to

[[Page 9]]

more than 62,000 disasters in 1998. Whether it was a fire that destroyed 
a family's home or a hurricane that destroyed an entire region, the Red 
Cross reacted immediately with compassion, generosity, and humanity.
Yet the Red Cross does more than cope with emergencies. During the past 
year, volunteers collected and processed nearly six million units of 
lifesaving blood for our Nation's hospitals and educated more than 11 
million Americans through health and safety courses. The Red Cross also 
reached out to the men and women of our Armed Forces, their families, 
and our veterans, helping our military personnel keep in touch with home 
during family emergencies, offering confidential counseling and other 
support services, and assisting veterans in obtaining their benefits. In 
the past year alone, the American Red Cross pro vided more than 840,000 
individual services to those who have given so much to protect our 
Nation and preserve our freedom.
During American Red Cross Month, as we take time to recognize this vital 
organization and all that it has accomplished, we can and should look 
forward with hope to the new century. For while we can never know the 
challenges we may face in the future, whether as individuals or as a 
national community, we do know that the American Red Cross will continue 
to serve, enabling us to meet those challenges and to recover from 
disaster. As Americans, let us sustain our long-standing support of the 
Red Cross and its humanitarian mission and renew our commitment to the 
ideals upon which it was founded. By reaching out with compassion and 
caring to help those in need, we can ensure a brighter future for our 
Nation and our world in the new millennium.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of 
the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, do hereby proclaim March 1999 as American Red Cross Month. I 
urge all the people of the United States to show support for their local 
Red Cross chapters and to become active participants in advancing the 
noble mission of the Red Cross.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

Proclamation 7169 of March 1, 1999

Irish-American Heritage Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During the month of March each year, as millions of Americans celebrate 
St. Patrick's Day, we remember with special pride our Irish heritage. We 
remember our ancestors who stood on Ireland's western shores, yearning 
for the promise of America. Fleeing famine and injustice, they longed 
for

[[Page 10]]

a new world of opportunities. Millions of these courageous men and women 
set sail from Ireland, leaving behind all that they had ever known to 
seek the promise of America. They gave to their new homeland their 
strength and spirit, sinew and determination, eloquence and wit. In 
return, America offered them the opportunity for a better life, the 
chance to rise above poverty and discrimination, and a future where they 
could live out their dreams.
The Irish who came to America endured many hardships, but they prospered 
and helped to build our country with innumerable physical and 
intellectual contributions. They gave us Presidents like Woodrow Wilson, 
John Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan; patriots like John Barry and Stephen 
Moylan, who fought fiercely for American independence in the 
Revolutionary War; jurists like Justice William Brennan, who championed 
justice and equality; suffragists and social reformers like Maria 
McCreery; journalists, peacekeepers, artists, playwrights, labor 
leaders, and educators. These and so many other Irish Americans seized 
the opportunity of freedom America promised. From their grand literary 
tradition to their deep religious faith, Irish Americans and their 
descendants have enriched every facet of American history.
But Irish-American Heritage Month is a time to look to the future as 
well as to the past. Today we rejoice at the promise of peace in 
Northern Ireland and the resolve of her people to approach their 
differences not with weapons, but with words. While the path to peace is 
rarely easy, it is by necessity a community effort. Americans are a 
vital part of the process in Northern Ireland by virtue of our shared 
heritage and shared goal of lasting peace and a better future for all 
God's children. By lending our hearts, minds, and prayers to the work of 
peace, we can best fulfill our obligation to the generations of Irish 
men and women who have given so much to our Nation's life and history.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1999 as Irish-
American Heritage Month. I call upon all the people of the United States 
to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.

Proclamation 7170 of March 1, 1999

Women's History Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A little more than a century ago, an editorial in the Pittsburgh 
Dispatch opposing women's suffrage and criticizing women in the work 
force so infuri

[[Page 11]]

ated a young reader that she wrote a letter in protest. Her articulate 
response prompted the newspaper's editor to offer her a job, and thus 
Elizabeth Cochrane--later known as Nellie Bly--began her career in 
journalism. A pioneer of investigative reporting, she exposed the brutal 
conditions in the care of the mentally ill, reported on poor working 
conditions in factories, and wrote of the indignities suffered by women 
in prison. This year, as we reflect on America's past in preparation for 
our celebration of the new millennium, we recognize that the talent, 
energy, intellect, and determination of countless women like Nellie Bly 
have shaped our destiny and enriched our society since our earliest days 
as a Nation.
From the women who organized the East India Company tea boycotts before 
the Boston Tea Party to Deborah Sampson, who fought as a soldier in the 
Revolutionary War; from Angelina and Sarah Grimke, who spoke out against 
slavery to Harriet Tubman, who risked her life as a conductor on the 
Underground Railroad; from suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt to 
sharecropper Fannie Lou Hamer, who faced violence and endured 
intimidation to become a leader of the Civil Rights movement; from 
environmentalist Rachel Carson, who changed our way of looking at the 
world, to physicist Chien-Shiung Wu, who changed our way of looking at 
the universe, women's history is truly America's history. That is why I 
was pleased to establish in July of last year the President's Commission 
on the Celebration of Women in American History, whose recommendations 
will help us to better understand and rejoice to appreciate the role and 
accomplishments of women.
During Women's History Month, we honor the generations of women who have 
served our Nation as doctors and scientists, teachers and factory 
workers, soldiers and secretaries, athletes and mothers. We honor the 
women who have worked the land, cared for children and the elderly, 
nurtured families and businesses, served in charitable organizations and 
public office. And we remember the good friends we have so recently 
lost--women such as Bella Abzug, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, and Florence 
Griffith-Joyner--whose achievements and example continue to light our 
lives.
But we must do more than remember. We must build on the legacy of the 
millions of women, whether renowned or anonymous, who have contributed 
so much to the strength and character of our Nation. We must ensure that 
women have equal access to the education and opportunities they need to 
excel. We must guarantee that women receive equal pay in the workplace. 
We must promote policies and programs--including affordable, high-
quality child care--that enable working women to succeed both on the job 
and in their homes. And we must work to ensure that women have the 
comfort of knowing they can retire in security. Women who have gone 
before us accomplished so much, often in the face of hardship and 
discrimination; we can only imagine what women will accomplish in the 
future if we break down the remaining barriers that prevent them from 
reaching their full potential.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1999 as Women's 
History Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and to remember

[[Page 12]]

throughout the year the many heroic women whose many and varied 
contributions have enriched our lives.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.

Proclamation 7171 of March 1, 1999

Save Your Vision Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Vision is an extraordinary blessing--one that should be cherished and 
protected. Complex and remarkable organs, the eyes work in concert with 
the brain to produce vision, allowing us to experience the beauty and 
variety of the physical world around us.
Because blindness and vision loss are often avoidable, the maintenance 
of good vision must be a top health priority and an integral part of 
every American's overall health care routine. Preventative eye care is 
particularly important because there are often no warning signs or pain 
associated with many eye diseases, and, by the time vision loss is 
identified, it is frequently too late to undo the damage. Periodic 
dilated pupil eye examinations can reveal the early signs of eye disease 
and buy precious time for treatment.
It is equally important to protect our eyes from injury, another leading 
cause of vision loss. Each year, more than 2.4 million eye injuries 
occur in the United States. By using protective eyewear when working 
with machinery or chemicals, playing sports, or engaging in other 
recreational activities, we can help prevent irreparable loss of sight.
Taking measures to prevent vision loss in our children is especially 
important because their early development and academic achievement can 
suffer due to vision problems or diseases. Even before they begin 
school, children should undergo a complete eye examination so that poor 
vision or eye disorders can be appropriately treated.
As the 21st century fast approaches, our national investment in research 
to prevent, postpone, and treat eye diseases and disorders has produced 
substantial results. Laser technology, new medications, gene mapping, 
innovations in diagnostic techniques, and other sight-saving discoveries 
are improving the lives of millions of Americans. These advances in 
medical research, combined with preventative eye care and increased 
safety measures, can all work to preserve our gift of sight.
To remind our citizens of the importance of safeguarding their eyesight, 
the Congress, by join resolution approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 
629; 36 U.S.C. 169a), has authorized and requested the President to 
proclaim the first week in March of each year as ``Save Your Vision 
Week.''

[[Page 13]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim March 7 through March 13, 1999, as Save Your 
Vision Week. I urge all Americans to participate by making eye care and 
eye safety an important part of their lives and to ensure that dilated 
eye examinations are included in their regular health maintenance 
programs. I invite eye care professionals, the media, and all public and 
private organizations dedicated to preserving eyesight to join in 
activities that will raise awareness of the measures we can take to 
protect and sustain our vision.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.

Proclamation 7173 of March 11, 1999

National Older Workers Employment Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One of our Nation's most valuable but least appreciated assets is its 
workers aged 55 and older. Older Americans bring to the workplace sound 
judg

[[Page 14]]

ment, broad knowledge and experience, proven problem-solving abilities, 
and a strong work ethic. Despite their often impressive qualifications, 
however, older men and women who attempt to change jobs or seek new 
careers frequently encounter difficulties. Some employers mistakenly 
fear that older workers lack the skills and flexibility to learn new 
technologies and procedures; others think that they no longer have the 
energy and motivation to compete in today's fast-paced and stressful 
work environment; still others are unwilling to pay older workers the 
salaries they deserve and prefer instead to hire younger, less 
experienced employees at lower rates. Such employers are short-sighted.
Americans are living longer, healthier, more active lives. In the next 
century, as our economy continues to expand and the demand for skilled 
workers continues to grow, older citizens will become an increasingly 
vital resource. If our Nation is to thrive in the 21st century, we must 
encourage businesses to recognize the rich potential of older workers, 
to make the most of their knowledge, skills, and experience, and to 
retain qualified older employees in the workforce.
We must also remain vigilant in protecting the rights and well-being of 
older Americans. Laws such as the Age Discrimination Act, the Older 
Americans Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act protect 
older workers from age bias and discrimination and help assure their 
fair treatment in the workplace. In addition, the Department of Labor 
and the Department of Health and Human Services, through such efforts as 
the Senior Community Service Employment Program and the programs of the 
Administration on Aging, assist older workers who give their time and 
energy to contribute to our Nation's economy.
As we observe this special week, let us remember with appreciation the 
many invaluable contributions older workers make to our country's 
progress and prosperity, and let us resolve to give older Americans an 
equal opportunity to participate in the workplace.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States, 
by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, do hereby proclaim March 14 through March 20, 1999, 
as National Older Workers Employment Week. I urge employers across the 
Nation to recognize the energy and ability of older workers, and I 
encourage public officials responsible for job placement, training, and 
related services to intensify their efforts throughout the year to help 
older workers find suitable jobs and training.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

Proclamation 7174 of March 19, 1999

National Poison Prevention Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Poison Prevention Week, Americans focus on the progress 
we have made in reducing the number of accidental poisonings that occur 
each year and reaffirm our commitment to preventing further tragedies.
We can be heartened by the progress we have made. In 1962, when 
President Kennedy proclaimed the first National Poison Prevention Week, 
450 young people died due to poisoning. That number has fallen 
dramatically. There are many who share the credit for this growing 
success story: responsible parents and caregivers, who keep medicines, 
cosmetics, household cleaners, insecticides, and other poisonous 
substances out of the reach of children; the U.S. Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, which requires the use of child-resistant packaging 
on potentially dangerous materials; the Poison Prevention Week Council, 
which annually distributes poison prevention information to pharmacies, 
public health departments, and safety organizations; and our Nation's 
poison control centers, which provide lifesaving emergency first aid 
information. Working together, these dedicated individuals and 
organizations have saved hundreds of lives each year.
But we cannot relax our efforts, because each life we lose to accidental 
poisoning is one too many. We must all do our part to protect our 
Nation's children by selecting and properly using child-resistant 
packaging, keeping poisonous substances accurately labeled and locked 
away from children, carefully reading and following all directions and 
caution labels on packages, and keeping the number of a poison control 
center close to the telephone. If a poisoning incident does occur, we 
need to respond quickly by contacting the poison control center, 
relaying the appropriate information--such as the age and weight of the 
poisoning victim and the type and amount of substance he or she has 
ingested--and heeding instructions. These simple safety measures can 
mean the difference between life and death.
To encourage the American people to learn more about the dangers of 
accidental poisonings and to take responsible preventive measures, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 
681), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week of March of each year as ``National Poison 
Prevention Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning March 21, 1999, as 
National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this week by participating in appropriate ceremonies and activities and 
by learning how to protect our children from poisons.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and

Proclamation 7175 of March 24, 1999

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and 
American Democracy, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America has deep roots in Greece, and today we celebrate the friendship, 
values, and aspirations our two countries have shared for more than 2 
centuries. Greek thought and the passion for truth and justice deeply 
influenced many of our Nation's earliest and greatest leaders. The 
documents our founders wrote to establish our democracy and the 
political and legal institutions they created to preserve our 
independence and protect our rights reveal that influence.
Later, recognizing this profound debt to Greek thought and culture and 
inspired by the struggle of modern Greece in the War of Greek 
Independence, many Americans left home to join in that distant fight for 
freedom between 1821 and 1832. In this century, the relationship between 
the Greek and American peoples deepened as we fought together in two 
world wars. The U.S. desire to help preserve freedom in Greece after the 
devastation of World War II moved President Truman to stand firm against 
isolationism and for postwar engagement abroad. Our nations stood 
together in Korea and in the Gulf War, and we continue to work shoulder-
to-shoulder today in our efforts to find a lasting solution in the 
Balkans and to promote democracy around the world.
The bonds of family have further reinforced our ties of friendship and 
shared ideals. All across our Nation, Americans of Greek descent have 
brought their energy, grace, and determination to every field of 
endeavor, and they have added immeasurably to the richness and diversity 
of our national life. The sons and daughters of Greece have flourished 
in America, and with their help, America too has flourished.
Today, as we celebrate the 178th anniversary of the onset of modern 
Greece's struggle for independence, let us celebrate as well the great 
partnership between our nations and the precious heritage of freedom and 
democracy we share.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 1999, as Greek 
Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American 
Democracy. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine,

[[Page 17]]

and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-third.

Proclamation 7176 of March 25, 1999

Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Our Nation was founded at a time of extraordinary change, as the world 
began to move from an agrarian to an industrial economy. Today, as we 
approach the 21st century, exciting innovations in science and 
technology are revolutionizing our society, and once again Americans 
must adapt to the demands of a new era. Beckoning us with exciting new 
challenges and far-reaching opportunities, our future depends as never 
before on our Nation's commitment to excellence in education.
Americans have met the dynamic changes in our society not only through 
education but also by finding strength in our shared goals and values. 
And, as we prepare for the challenges of a new millennium, these time-
honored principles must remain an important part of our children's 
education. Far more than the accumulation of facts and figures, a well-
rounded education that will serve our children throughout their lives 
must also include the wisdom and insights of past generations. Family 
members, teachers, administrators, and neighbors should share their 
experiences and ideals with young people to help them develop into 
mature, confident, and responsible adults.
An esteemed scholar and inspired religious leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel 
Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, devoted his life to empowering young 
people through education. His belief in the importance of intellectual 
and spiritual enlightenment led him to establish more than 2,000 
educational and social institutions around the world. Promoting faith, 
family, and community, his work enriched our society and helped to lay 
the foundation for our continued progress.
On this day and throughout the year, let us rededicate ourselves to the 
ideals of education and sharing that were championed by Rabbi Schneerson 
and are embraced by compassionate leaders across our country. As our 
society continues to change and evolve, let us work with keen minds and 
warm hearts to forge a future of peace and prosperity for all our 
children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 28, 1999, as 
Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I invite Government officials, 
educators, volunteers, and all of the people of the United States to 
observe this day with appropriate activities, programs, and ceremonies.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and

[[Page 18]]

of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 7177 of April 1, 1999

Cancer Control Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year for more than half a century, our Nation has dedicated the 
month of April to reaffirming our commitment to developing more 
effective prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer and to 
recognizing the progress that we have made in fighting this devastating 
disease.
Today we are reaping the rewards of our long-standing efforts to combat 
cancer as researchers make remarkable progress virtually every day. Over 
the past several years, for example, scientists have identified genes 
involved in a number of cancers, including cancers of the breast, 
prostate, kidney, skin, and colon. In the first year of the Cancer 
Genome Anatomy Project at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
researchers succeeded in identifying more than 300,000 DNA sequences and 
12,000 new genes--double the initial expectation. The newly created 
Cancer Genetics Network will help scientists answer the many clinical 
questions raised by these discoveries. This national network will link 
participating cancer research centers and strengthen their efforts not 
only to identify genes that predispose people to cancer, but also to 
learn better methods for counseling, testing, and monitoring people for 
cancer susceptibility. These and other recent advances are providing 
Americans with our most powerful weapons to defeat cancer: early 
detection and immediate treatment.
Recognizing the great promise such findings hold for our battle against 
cancer, my Administration has dedicated unprecedented Federal resources 
toward cancer research. The omnibus appropriations bill I signed this 
past October increased funding for the NCI by $400 million. This 
increase--the single largest increase in funding for cancer and medical 
research in history--sets the NCI budget at nearly $3 billion, enabling 
it to fund critical new research, including 10 new clinical trials for 
breast cancer treatment. Last year we saw one of the most significant 
advances to date in cancer prevention research with the discoveries from 
the landmark Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. This study, a national 
clinical trial sponsored by the NCI, found that the incidence of breast 
cancer fell by 49 percent among women taking the anti-estrogen drug 
tamoxifen. Based upon this finding, last October, the Food and Drug 
Administration approved tamoxifen for preventative use by women at risk 
for breast cancer.
Through the Department of Defense, we are also awarding $60 million in 
grants for prostate cancer research. These grants are funding innovative 
new studies to determine the causes of prostate cancer, develop new 
methods of prevention and detection, and discover groundbreaking new 
treatments to save lives. In addition, we have worked to accelerate the 
approval process for new cancer drugs to ensure that cancer patients 
have access to

[[Page 19]]

the latest and most effective treatments, all while maintaining the 
highest of safety standards.
Although these and other recent advances are encouraging, we must not be 
complacent. The occurrence of cancer is still too common, and the 
suffering it causes is incalculable. As we stand on the threshold of a 
new millennium, let us draw strength from the successes of the past and 
reaffirm our determination to treat, prevent, and ultimately eradicate 
cancer.
In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution (52 
Stat. 148; 36 U.S.C. 150) requesting the President to issue an annual 
proclamation declaring April to be ``Cancer Control Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim April 1999 as Cancer Control Month. I invite 
the Governors of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the 
Mayor of the District of Columbia, and the appropriate officials of all 
other areas under the American flag to issue similar proclamations. I 
also ask health care professionals, private industry, community groups, 
insurance and managed care companies, and all other interested 
organizations and individuals to unite in renewing our Nation's 
commitment to controlling cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7178 of April 1, 1999

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Children bring happiness to our lives and hope to our future; they are 
our greatest joy and our most important responsibility. Whether as 
loving parents or concerned citizens, we must do everything we can to 
nurture them, protect them, raise them in an atmosphere of love and 
respect, and create for them an environment in which they can grow into 
healthy, well-adjusted, and productive adults.
Tragically, however, statistics confirm that not all of America's 
children enjoy the benefits of a safe, loving home. Instead, hundreds of 
thousands of children each year suffer abuse and neglect, most often at 
the hands of their own parents or other family members. The horrors of 
physical or emotional trauma deny these young people their childhood, 
and our abused children carry the psychological scars of their 
mistreatment throughout their lives. Worse yet, for some--particularly 
those under 3 years old--the abuse they endure is fatal.
My Administration is committed to promoting effective policies and 
innovative programs to protect children from harm and to mitigate the 
stresses

[[Page 20]]

on families that can ignite violence in the home. We have implemented a 
comprehensive agenda that includes increased funding at the State level 
to ensure that maternal and child health programs are expanded to 
include child protection, family preservation, and support; we have 
released prevention grants for community-based family services in all 50 
States; and we have worked with the Congress to pass the Adoption and 
Safe Families Act of 1997, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement 
Act of 1994, and the National Child Protection Act of 1993, all of which 
support child abuse prevention efforts in State and local jurisdictions.
Yet government programs alone cannot prevent child abuse. As a society 
that cares about the health and well-being of our children, we must 
forge caring, cooperative alliances that include government as a 
partner, but also involve schools, community organizations, businesses, 
religious groups, and especially parents and family members themselves--
indeed, everyone who has a stake in the future of American families. 
During this special month, as we focus our Nation's attention on the 
disturbing problem of child abuse, let us remember that behind every 
heartbreaking statistic is a child whose health, happiness, and future 
depend on our ability to recognize the signs of abuse and our refusal to 
tolerate abuse in our homes and communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 1999 as National 
Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
month by demonstrating our gratitude to those who work to keep our 
children safe, and by taking action in our own communities to make them 
healthier places in which children can grow and thrive.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7179 of April 7, 1999

National Equal Pay Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We live in a time of remarkable promise. Our Nation's economy is the 
strongest we have experienced in a generation, creating more than 18 
million new jobs since 1993 and the fastest growth in real wages in more 
than two decades. American women have contributed greatly to this record 
of success; unfortunately, they have not enjoyed an equal share in the 
prosperity they have helped to create.
The typical woman who works full-time year-round earns approximately 75 
cents for every dollar the typical man earns. An African American woman 
earns just 65 cents and a Hispanic woman earns 55 cents for each

[[Page 21]]

dollar that a white man earns. In the course of a week, this pay gap can 
mean one less bag of groceries, skipping a trip to the doctor, missing a 
rent payment, or not being able to pay for day care. Over the course of 
a working lifetime, it can mean thousands of dollars, a smaller pension, 
and fewer savings to provide for a comfortable retirement. And when a 
working woman is denied equal pay, it doesn't just hurt her; it also 
hurts her family. In more than 10 million American households today, the 
mother is the only breadwinner.
Americans have always believed in justice and equality. We have always 
believed that those who work hard should be able to provide a decent 
living for themselves and their children. If we are to live up to those 
ideals, we must ensure that women do not suffer wage discrimination. We 
must continue vigorous enforcement of existing laws, such as the Equal 
Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, so that no employer 
undervalues or underpays the work performed by women. To strengthen 
Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission efforts 
to end wage discrimination and expand opportunities in the workplace for 
women, my Administration has included a $14 million Equal Pay Initiative 
in my proposed balanced budget for fiscal year 2000. This initiative 
will provide more resources to identify wage discrimination, to educate 
workers and employers about their rights and responsibilities, and to 
bring more women into better-paying jobs. We will also work with the 
Congress to pass the proposed Paycheck Fairness Act--legislation 
designed to strengthen laws that prohibit wage discrimination.
As we observe National Equal Pay Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to 
justice and equality in the workplace, and let us build a Nation for the 
21st century where the talents, efforts, and hard work of American women 
will be rightly appreciated and fairly rewarded.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 8, 1999, 
as National Equal Pay Day. I call upon Government officials, law 
enforcement agencies, business leaders, educators, and the American 
people to recognize the full value of the skills and contributions of 
women in the labor force. I urge all employers to review their wage 
practices and to ensure that all their employees are paid equitably for 
their work.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7180 of April 8, 1999

National D.A.R.E. Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program, founded in 1983 
by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, helps children across our Nation develop into the bright, 
talented, and healthy individuals they have the potential to become. The 
D.A.R.E. curriculum is designed to give children in kindergarten through 
12th grade the skills they need to avoid involvement in drugs, gangs, 
and violence. Taught by community police officers who have the special 
training and experience necessary to address the difficult issues facing 
young people, the D.A.R.E. program reaches more than 26 million students 
each day in nearly 75 percent of our Nation's school districts, 
encouraging young Americans to resist peer pressure and to lead lives 
free from the shadows of drugs and violence.
D.A.R.E.'s mission is a crucial one. Drug abuse costs our Nation more 
than 14,000 lives and billions of dollars each year. A recent study by 
the Department of Justice confirms that drug use continues to be a 
factor in crimes such as burglary, auto theft, assault, and murder, and 
that one in six offenders commits a crime just to get money for drugs. 
Because of alarming statistics like these, we must focus our efforts not 
just on those already addicted to drugs, but on all our young people, so 
that we can reach them before they are exposed to these illegal 
substances. Working in partnership with parents, teachers, and 
communities, the D.A.R.E. program conveys to children at an 
impressionable age a strong message about the dangers of substance abuse 
and strives to give them the tools and motivation they need to avoid 
those dangers.
Expanding on grassroots efforts like D.A.R.E., my Administration's 1999 
National Drug Control Strategy provides a comprehensive approach to move 
us closer to a drug-free America. An important part of this long-term 
plan is our emphasis on educating children. We know that when children 
understand the dangers of drugs, their rates of drug use decline. Our 
National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign and the Safe and Drug-Free 
Schools program focus on helping young Americans reject illegal drugs 
and violence. In addition, in recent years, we have protected and 
increased the funding of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program. Coupled 
with programs like D.A.R.E., these efforts offer us real hope for 
freeing America's communities from the tragedy of substance abuse and 
the crime and violence they spawn. By doing so, we will give our 
children the safe and healthy future they deserve.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 8, 1999, as National 
D.A.R.E. Day. I call upon our youth, parents, educators, and all the 
people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate 
programs and activities.
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of

Proclamation 7181 of April 9, 1999

Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Inspired by the powerful words of Thomas Jefferson, the courageous 
military tactics of Jose de San Martin, and the revolutionary spirit of 
Simon Bolivar and many other leaders, the peoples of the Americas forged 
their nations with a profound respect for liberty and justice. Today, a 
devotion to democratic ideals unifies the countries in our hemisphere. 
The strengthening of democratic institutions and practices throughout 
the Americas reflects our enduring commitment to human rights, free and 
fair elections, and the rule of law. The expansion of open markets 
illustrates our determination to achieve sustainable economic growth. At 
the dawn of a new millennium, we must work with a renewed spirit of 
cooperation to meet the challenges of our future and fulfill the destiny 
of our region.
In strengthening the ties that bind our nations together, we reaffirm 
our shared commitment to democracy and to the security of our 
hemisphere. Last April, the democratically elected leaders of our 
hemisphere met in Santiago, Chile, for the second Summit of the 
Americas. Building on the foundation laid at the Miami Summit in 1994, 
we developed an action plan for the future. Our strategy includes 
concrete methods to strengthen democracy, protect human rights, increase 
access to education, expand free and fair trade, and reduce corruption.
Thanks in part to the strong bonds between the nations of the Americas, 
our region has achieved an unprecedented era of peace and stability. As 
one of the world's oldest regional alliances, the Organization of 
American States has served as a guiding institution in that endeavor. 
Through several vital initiatives, it has worked to foster multilateral 
cooperation, to bolster hemispheric security, to resolve regional 
disputes, and to combat corruption, drug trafficking, and international 
terrorism. Our community of democracies also encouraged the governments 
of Peru and Ecuador to sign an historic Peace Accord last October that 
finally put their longstanding border dispute to an end.
As we look to our common future, we must not forget that our vision for 
the Western Hemisphere also includes Cuba, whose citizens must be 
allowed the fruits of liberty and the rewards of integration. We must 
also remember that our commitment to closer cooperation becomes 
especially important in times of tragedy. As hundreds of thousands of 
people across the Americas work to rebuild their homes and their lives 
in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch and the earthquake in Colombia, we 
must be there to lend a helping hand and to provide the tools necessary 
to revitalize the economies of our neighbors and help renew their 
communities. United by a proud history and a shared interest in 
deepening political, cultural, and

[[Page 24]]

economic ties, the democracies of our hemisphere can serve as a beacon 
of peace and prosperity for citizens around the world.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, April 14, 1999, 
as Pan American Day and April 11 through April 17, 1999, as Pan American 
Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the 
flag of the United States to honor these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.

Proclamation 7182 of April 9, 1999

National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

``We are honored to have had the opportunity to serve our country . . . 
.'' With these simple words, Navy Commander Jeremiah Denton, released in 
1973 from North Vietnam with his companions after the longest wartime 
captivity of any group of Americans in our history, summed up the 
courage, selflessness, and indomitable spirit of generations of American 
prisoners of war.
For more than two centuries, Americans have risked and lost their own 
freedom to defend democracy, preserve America's liberty and values, and 
protect our national interests around the world. In Andersonville or 
along the Yalu River, confined in Nazi stalags or enduring torture in 
the Hanoi Hilton, our prisoners of war have set an extraordinary example 
of valor, patriotism, and devotion to duty in the face of enormous 
hardship and adversity. The somber black and white POW/MIA flag serves 
as a reminder of their sacrifice and symbolizes our Nation's deep 
concern for and steadfast commitment to these brave Americans and their 
families.
But, however dark and trying the ordeal for our prisoners of war, their 
sacrifices did indeed serve a grand purpose. Inspired by their bravery 
in captivity, our Nation has been resolute in its defense of liberty. 
And, because of their sacrifice, the United States today is strong, 
free, and prosperous, looking forward to a future of limitless 
possibility.
Today we pay special tribute to our Nation's former prisoners of war and 
their families and express our heartfelt gratitude for their many 
sacrifices. They have embodied the ideals of a strong people and a free 
Nation. They have represented America at its best, and they have served 
a grateful Nation with honor, dignity, and distinction. As we honor 
them, let us also keep foremost in our thoughts and prayers Staff 
Sergeant Andrew Ramirez,

[[Page 25]]

Staff Sergeant Christopher Stone, and Specialist Steven Gonzales of the 
United States Army as they endure unjust captivity in Yugoslavia and as 
we work for their safety and swift release.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 1999, as National 
Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon all Americans to 
join me in remembering former American prisoners of war who suffered the 
hardships of enemy captivity. I also call upon Federal, State, and local 
government officials and private organizations to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.

Proclamation 7183 of April 14, 1999

Jewish Heritage Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Nearly 350 years have passed since the first Jewish settlers arrived in 
America. The sons and daughters of a proud and ancient heritage, they 
brought to this new land gifts that have enriched our national life 
tremendously: a deep faith in God, a strong sense of morality, a 
devotion to family and community, a thirst for freedom, a reverence for 
justice, and a long tradition of philanthropy.
Millions of Jews have shared the American immigrant experience. Many 
came here fleeing poverty and persecution, yearning for religious or 
political freedom, seeking a better life for themselves and their 
families. Investing their dreams, ambitions, labor, and love in our 
country, Jewish immigrants overcame great obstacles to rise as far as 
their talents and effort could take them. Today their descendants 
continue to make extraordinary contributions to the cultural, economic, 
religious, and intellectual life of our Nation. In education, the arts, 
politics, the law, science, entertainment, technology, philanthropy, 
industry, and every other field of endeavor, Jewish men and women have 
excelled in their pursuits and strengthened America with their character 
and accomplishments.
As we look forward to a new century and a new millennium, let us give 
thanks for all that the Jewish community in America has done to keep our 
Nation free, strong, and prosperous. Let us celebrate the freedom of 
religion guaranteed by our founders in the Bill of Rights, which has 
done so much to attract men and women of conscience to this land. Let us 
recognize that our country's great diversity of races, religions, 
ethnicities, and cultures will prove to be among our greatest strengths 
in the global community of tomorrow. And let us reaffirm our sacred 
obligation to build a future based upon a spirit of tolerance, respect, 
and understanding.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 25, 
1999, as Jewish Heritage Week. I urge all Americans to observe this week 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

Proclamation 7184 of April 15, 1999

National Park Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's national parks are truly America's national treasures. Within 
their borders lie much of what is most precious to us: the breathtaking 
beauty of mountains, rivers, forests, and valleys; the extraordinary 
richness and variety of plants and animals; the places and artifacts of 
the special people and events that have shaped both our history and our 
destiny.
This week we remember with gratitude one of those special people who 
played a pivotal role in the creation of our country's National Park 
System. Conservationist John Muir emigrated to the United States as a 
child 150 years ago this year. As a young man, he experienced for the 
first time the high country of California's Sierra Nevada and Yosemite, 
and for the rest of his life he championed America's wild places. 
``Everybody needs beauty as well as bread,'' he wrote, ``places to play 
in and pray in, where nature may heal and cheer and give strength to 
body and soul alike.'' He became the driving force behind the creation 
of such national parks as Yosemite, Sequoia, Mount Rainier, Petrified 
Forest, and Grand Canyon, and was an early advocate of an agency to 
manage them in a consistent manner. Although he died two years before 
the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916, many still 
regard John Muir as the ``Father of our National Park System.''
Visitors to our Nation's wondrous national treasures can still 
experience the scenic grandeur that so inspired John Muir. In Washington 
State's Mount Rainier National Park, glaciers radiate from the summit 
and slopes of an ancient volcano, rising above dense green forests and 
brilliantly flowered meadows. This year, we celebrate the centennial 
anniversary of this cherished national park, preserved because of the 
vision and efforts of a coalition of mountaineers, geologists, and 
conservationists, including John Muir.
Today, the National Park System has grown to 378 sites visited by more 
than 285 million people each year. Each of these sites is interwoven 
with America's richly diverse natural and cultural heritage to make up 
the pattern of our past, the fabric of our present, and the promise of 
our future.

[[Page 27]]

The two newest additions to our park system reflect this grand 
tradition. Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site in 
Arkansas pays tribute to the courage and quiet dignity of nine young 
African Americans who crossed the color line and changed American 
society forever. Alabama's Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site 
celebrates the World War II exploits of the all-black Army Air Corps 
unit whose members prevailed over prejudice and discrimination in the 
U.S. Armed Forces to compile a distinguished combat record in defense of 
freedom.
At these and so many other parks and historic sites across the country, 
the dedicated men and women of the National Park Service preserve 
America's heritage and teach a new generation the importance of informed 
and careful stewardship of our Nation's treasured places. During 
National Park Week, let us give thanks for the wisdom of all those who 
established our national parks and for the hard work and generous spirit 
of all those who continue to preserve them for our benefit. Because of 
their efforts, Americans will always find in our national parks the 
beauty, inspiration, knowledge, and renewal of spirit that have blessed 
our national journey for so long.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 19 through April 25, 
1999, as National Park Week.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7185 of April 16, 1999

National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Organ donation is one of humanity's most noble expressions of compassion 
and generosity. It reflects the extraordinary selflessness of the donor 
and gives the recipient a second chance to experience life's abundant 
blessings.
For many people across our country, receiving an organ or tissue 
transplant means relief from suffering and a marked improvement in the 
quality of their lives. For others, it literally means the difference 
between life and death. And the demand for such donations continues to 
grow. In the last six years, the number of people on the national organ 
transplant list has doubled, from more than 30,000 in 1993 to more than 
62,000 patients today. A new name is added to that list every 18 
seconds.
Fortunately, thanks to remarkable medical breakthroughs, each of us has 
the power to improve these troubling statistics. In December of 1997, 
Vice President Gore and Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
Donna Shalala launched the National Organ and Tissue Donation Initiative 
to raise

[[Page 28]]

awareness of the successes of transplantation and to educate our 
citizens about the urgent and continuing need for organ and tissue 
donations. Building on this effort, the Health Care Financing 
Administration now requires hospitals participating in Medicaid and 
Medicare to notify organ procurement organizations of all deaths and 
imminent deaths at their facilities and to train their personnel to 
discuss donation with the families of potential donors. Judging from the 
positive impact of similar legislation in Pennsylvania, we anticipate 
that this new Federal regulation will substantially increase the number 
of donations throughout the country.
Becoming a donor is simple, requiring only that we complete and carry a 
donor card and inform our families and friends about our wish to donate. 
This second step is a critical one because, according to a new study 
issued by HHS, almost all Americans would agree to donate their loved 
one's tissue or organs if they knew their loved one had requested it. 
Fewer than half would consent if they did not know their loved one's 
wishes.
During National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week, I urge all 
Americans to become potential donors. By doing so, we can bring new hope 
and improved lives to thousands of our fellow citizens and hasten the 
day when no American on the organ transplant waiting list loses the race 
against time.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 24, 
1999, as National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week. I urge all 
health care professionals, educators, the media, public and private 
organizations concerned with organ donation and transplantation, the 
clergy, and all Americans to join me in promoting greater awareness and 
acceptance of this humanitarian action.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7186 of April 16, 1999

National Volunteer Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Helping others--and helping others help themselves--through volunteer 
work is a great American tradition. Our Nation's dedicated volunteers 
come from all walks of life, all races, and all ages. Whether they 
support their communities through their churches, synagogues, or other 
religious institutions, serve full-time as AmeriCorps members, or spend 
a few hours a week helping out organizations or individuals in need, 
America's volunteers are bringing hope and help to their fellow citizens 
and building a stronger, more compassionate Nation for us all.

[[Page 29]]

Our volunteers know that service is one of the best ways to make a 
difference in the lives of others--and they are proving that Americans 
at any stage of life can serve. Thousands of older Americans donate 
their time to serve as foster grandparents, senior companions, and as 
part of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program and other initiatives. 
As many as 13 million young Americans aged 12 to 17 also volunteer each 
year, improving their communities, broadening their educational 
experiences, developing new skills, and increasing their understanding 
of the responsibilities of citizenship. This week, during National Youth 
Service Day, young people across our country will participate in service 
activities and demonstrate with their good works the power of youth to 
strengthen our Nation.
Volunteers will become increasingly vital to our society as we enter a 
new millennium. We cannot rely solely on charitable contributions or 
government programs to address the challenges we see in our communities. 
Each of us must find our own role and take action as a volunteer, a 
neighbor, and a citizen. We must work together to ensure that every 
child has a caring adult in his or her life, a safe place in which to 
live and grow, a good school to attend, a healthy start in life, and a 
chance to serve the community. We must continually strive to bring hope 
and hard work to bear on the human problems we see every day. With warm 
hearts and willing hands, we can make a lasting difference.
During this week, let us renew our spirit of community, our sense of 
idealism, and our commitment to service. Let us also honor the 
invaluable work of the thousands of voluntary, civic, religious, school, 
and neighborhood groups across our country that are leading the way by 
serving their fellow Americans and improving the quality of life for us 
all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 24, 
1999, as National Volunteer Week. I call upon all Americans to observe 
this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to 
express appreciation to the volunteers among us for their commitment to 
service and to encourage the spirit of volunteerism in our families and 
communities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7187 of April 22, 1999

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Over the past year, in communities across our Nation, Americans have 
witnessed with shock and disbelief the painful consequences of hatred 
and

[[Page 30]]

brutality. The beating and murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming and the 
killing of Billy Jack Gaither in Alabama taught us how easily prejudice 
can erupt into violence. The murder of James Byrd in Texas reminded us 
in stark terms of the poisonous legacy of racism in America. While the 
victims of these crimes are known to us because of the particularly 
heinous nature of the acts that took their lives, there are thousands 
more Americans unknown to us who become victims of crime each day. 
Behind each of these tragic statistics is an individual whose rights 
have been violated, whose life has been taken or irrevocably changed, 
and whose family, friends, and community have been touched by the 
shadows of violence and fear.
Recognizing the widespread impact of crime on our Nation, my 
Administration has worked hard during the past 6 years to strengthen our 
criminal justice system, to reduce the incidence of crime, and to 
champion the rights of crime victims. Through such landmark legislation 
as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994--which 
included the Violence Against Women Act, the Brady Bill, and the 
Community Notification Act--we have put thousands of new police officers 
into America's communities, given crime victims a greater voice in the 
criminal justice process, prevented more than a quarter million felons, 
fugitives, and stalkers from obtaining handguns, and protected women and 
children from violence and abuse in their homes and communities. With 
these and other measures, we have provided communities with needed 
assistance and have helped reduce the violent crime rate in the United 
States to its lowest level in nearly a quarter century.
But we still have much to do if we are to prevent those crimes motivated 
by hatred. That is why I have urged the Congress to pass the Hate Crimes 
Prevention Act of 1999. This proposed legislation would strengthen 
existing Federal hate crimes law by covering crimes committed because of 
the victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability, and by expanding 
the situations in which prosecutions can be brought for violent crimes 
perpetrated because of the victim's race, color, religion, or national 
origin.
As recent events have made clear, we must address intolerance early in 
life. We are reaching out to students in middle school--young people who 
are at an especially impressionable age--through a public-private 
partnership entitled ``Dealing with Our Differences.'' This partnership 
will develop a program to teach tolerance in the classroom, highlight 
positive ways in which adolescents are dealing with issues of diversity, 
and show the harmful impact intolerance causes in the daily lives of our 
youth. In an effort to understand better the problem of hate crimes and 
prejudice among young Americans, I have asked the Departments of Justice 
and Education to include in their annual report card on school safety a 
new section on hate crimes among our youth, whether they occur in school 
or elsewhere; and these departments will also collect and publish data 
regarding hate crimes and intolerance on college campuses.
During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, let us remember not only 
those who have suffered at the hands of criminals, but also those 
generous men and women who work each day to bring justice and healing to 
victims and their loved ones. Whether as victims' advocates, counselors, 
law enforcement personnel, prosecutors, or community volunteers, they 
reflect America's resolve to protect the rights of every citizen and to 
build a future

[[Page 31]]

where our differences no longer make us targets of hatred and 
intolerance. Let us also remember in our prayers the people of 
Littleton, Colorado. While it is still too early to determine the 
specific circumstances that led to this week's tragic events, it is 
never too soon to teach our children that violence and hatred are wrong 
and have no place in our schools or in our society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 25 through May 1, 
1999, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I urge all Americans to 
remember crime victims and their families by working to reduce violence, 
to assist those harmed by crime, and to make our homes and communities 
safer places in which to live and raise our families.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7188 of April 23, 1999

National Science and Technology Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The American experience is deeply rooted in the desire to expand our 
frontiers and increase our knowledge about ourselves and our world. We 
stand at the end of a century marked by wondrous advances in science and 
technology--advances that have immeasurably improved the lives of our 
citizens. As recently as 100 years ago, space travel, genetic 
engineering, and telecommunications existed only in the realms of 
imagination and science fiction. Today, the nascent International Space 
Station, the nearly complete Human Genome Project, and the flourishing 
Internet attest to the great strides our civilization and our Nation 
have made. The scope and speed of our discoveries are truly 
breathtaking, and each day new applications of science and technology 
enrich our lives in fields as diverse as medicine, communications, 
engineering, and the arts.
Recognizing the importance of maintaining America's scientific and 
technological leadership, my Administration is seeking increased funding 
in areas like biomedical research and in earth and space sciences. My 
fiscal year 2000 budget also proposes a 28 percent increase in 
information technology research to finance a new initiative--Information 
Technology for the Twenty-First Century (IT<SUP>2</SUP>). This 
initiative will support long-term information technology research that 
will lead to fundamental advances in communications and improvements in 
computing.
During National Science and Technology Week, in communities large and 
small, engineers, scientists, educators, business people, and community 
leaders will lead observances to help their fellow citizens appreciate 
the

[[Page 32]]

world's scientific and technological wonders. I encourage all 
Americans--and especially our young people--to participate in the many 
educational activities taking place across our Nation. The more we 
understand and appreciate the extraordinary tools that science and 
technology place at our fingertips, the more we can accomplish in our 
efforts to create a cleaner environment, healthier families, better 
schools, and a brighter future. The only limit on our achievements is 
our imagination.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 25 to May 1, 1999, 
as National Science and Technology Week. I call upon educators and 
students, the business community, and all the people of the United 
States to work this week and throughout the year to learn more about the 
contributions science and technology make to our lives and our future.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7189 of April 30, 1999

Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Seeking America's bright promise of freedom and fairness, millions of 
men and women of Asian and Pacific descent have immigrated to our Nation 
through the past 2 centuries to participate in our great experiment in 
democracy. Although they left behind their native lands and many of 
their loved ones, they carried in their hearts a rich and ancient 
history and a proud heritage.
Throughout the decades, the principles and cherished traditions of Asian 
and Pacific Americans have infused our way of life, and their diligence 
and determination have helped build and sustain our Nation. Asian 
immigrants and indigenous U.S. Pacific Islanders have made contributions 
to every facet of American life. Yet all too often, Asian immigrants and 
Pacific Islanders had to endure discrimination as our society struggled 
with its growing diversity. Overcoming prejudice and other hardships, 
these determined men and women have strengthened our society, our 
economy, and our national character in the process.
Asian and Pacific Americans today continue to make substantial 
contributions to our country and our culture, and this year's theme, 
``Celebrating Our Legacy,'' calls on us to recognize our common human 
spirit. Scientists and researchers like David Ho untangle the mysteries 
of human biology; astronauts like Kalpana Chawla explore the heavens; 
human rights activists like Dith Pran inspire us with their courage and 
conviction; athletes like Michele Kwan dazzle us with their grace and 
endurance; and inspiring

[[Page 33]]

leaders like Daniel Inouye and Bill Lann Lee fight for justice and 
equality for all our people. These sons and daughters of Vietnam, India, 
China, Korea, Japan, Cambodia, Fiji, the Philippines, Thailand, and many 
other nations, as well as the islands of Guam, American Samoa, and 
Hawaii, have enriched every aspect of our society with their talents, 
intellect, and determination.
While our Nation has made enormous strides on the path to full equality 
and inclusion, our work is far from finished. My Administration has 
strived to empower the Asian and Pacific American community by working 
to strengthen our economy, enforce our civil rights laws, invest in 
health and education, and promote racial reconciliation. Thanks in part 
to our economic initiatives, the median household income for Asian and 
Pacific Americans has significantly increased since 1993, while the 
poverty rate has declined by more than 8 percent. We have launched a new 
initiative to end racial and ethnic health disparities, and we 
established the first-ever Office of Minority Health Research and 
Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. Working to 
renew our commitment to excellence in education, my Administration also 
has secured a 35 percent increase in funding for bilingual and immigrant 
education.
To honor the accomplishments of Asian and Pacific Americans and to 
recognize their many contributions to our Nation, the Congress, by 
Public Law 102-450, has designated the month of May as ``Asian/Pacific 
American Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1999 as Asian/Pacific American Heritage 
Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this 
occasion with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

Proclamation 7190 of April 30, 1999

Older Americans Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As we look forward to the 21st century, we honor the millions of older 
Americans whose contributions have strengthened and sustained our Nation 
throughout the 20th century. These special citizens have led us through 
times of conflict, depression, peace, and prosperity and have witnessed 
firsthand the milestones that have defined this era as the ``American 
Century.'' This month, as we salute their achievements, let us also 
renew our commitment to preserve for older Americans a quality of life 
that will help them look ahead to the future with peace of mind.

[[Page 34]]

In recent decades, extraordinary advances in science, technology, and 
medicine, as well as our increased awareness of the importance of good 
nutrition and physical fitness, have enabled Americans to live longer, 
healthier lives. Over the course of the past 100 years, the average 
American's life-span has lengthened by nearly three decades, with the 
percentage of older Americans in our population more than tripling. By 
the year 2030, one in five Americans will be aged 65 or older.
As we enter the new millennium with a strong economy and the first 
budget surpluses since the 1960s, we have a historic opportunity to 
embrace the challenges and possibilities of a society where men and 
women will lead longer, more active, more productive lives. My 
Administration is working to make the most of this opportunity by 
proposing to set aside more than 75 percent of any budget surplus over 
the next 15 years to protect Social Security and Medicare; and we will 
also work to increase our investment in the scientific and medical 
research and development programs that will continue to lengthen and 
improve the lives of Americans in the years to come. We must continue to 
support older Americans--as well as their caregivers and those who 
provide critical home and community-based services--through a strong, 
reauthorized Older Americans Act; and we must work to ensure that long-
term care needs are met now and in the future.
The theme of this year's celebration, ``Honor the Past, Imagine the 
Future: Towards a Society for all Ages,'' reminds us of the profound 
debt of gratitude we owe to the generations of older Americans whose 
hard work, courage, faith, sacrifice, and patriotism helped to make this 
Nation great. Through turmoil and triumph, these Americans not only have 
defended our fundamental values of liberty, justice, and equality, but 
they also have handed down to younger generations the enduring 
traditions of community, family, and love of country that bind our 
society together.
Long life is a gift we must cherish and a wonderful opportunity and 
responsibility for which we must prepare. I urge all Americans to take 
time during this month to reaffirm our commitment, as individuals and as 
a Nation, to meet the challenges of an aging society. Working together, 
we can improve the lives of our older citizens, their families, and 
their caregivers and strive to ensure that all Americans enjoy healthy, 
financially secure, and productive lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1999 as Older 
Americans Month. I urge Government officials, business people, community 
leaders, educators, volunteers, and all the other people of the United 
States to celebrate the contributions older Americans have made 
throughout their lives to the progress of our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

Proclamation 7191 of April 30, 1999

Law Day, U.S.A., 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's founders recognized that the rule of law is the greatest 
guarantor of freedom and justice, the crucial barricade protecting 
civilization from chaos, democracy from tyranny. Among the chief 
grievances they enumerated in the Declaration of Independence were that 
``the present King of Great Britain . . . has refused his Assent to 
Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public Good. . . . He has 
made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their 
Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.''
The Constitution and Bill of Rights reflect our founders' reverence for 
and faith in the rule of law, and they stand as an enduring charter of 
freedom and equality that continues to protect our fundamental rights 
today. But only the passage of additional laws over time has fulfilled 
the promise of justice enshrined in that charter. Amendments abolishing 
slavery and guaranteeing due process and equal protection to everyone 
came only after the Civil War--nearly 80 years after the ratification of 
the Constitution. It took almost another century, and the courageous and 
persistent efforts of lawyers such as Thurgood Marshall, to establish 
that the equal protection clause prohibits governments from enforcing 
segregation in schools and other public arenas. Women did not gain the 
right to vote until the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.
During the past 4 decades, our Nation has continued to pursue the ideals 
of justice and equality. President Kennedy and President Johnson fought 
to enact what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, laws that safeguard the rights of citizens to vote, 
to work, to use public accommodations, and to attend school free from 
illegal discrimination. In 1967, President Johnson signed the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act to protect older Americans against 
discriminatory treatment in their jobs.
In 1990, President Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, landmark legislation that recognizes the right of people with 
disabilities to have equal opportunity for employment and equal access 
to public services. Building on the Americans with Disabilities Act, I 
announced a new initiative in January of this year to remove significant 
barriers that prevent people with disabilities from joining the work 
force. We will invest more than two billion dollars over the next 5 
years to provide tax credits to offset critical and expensive 
transportation costs, increased funding for assistive technology 
research, and greater access to health care for people with 
disabilities.
In May of 1998, I was proud to sign Executive Order 13087, which amends 
Federal equal employment opportunity policy to prohibit discrimination 
based on sexual orientation in the Federal civilian work force. My 
Administration is working with congressional leaders to pass the 
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would prohibit most 
private employers from firing good workers solely because they are gay 
or lesbian.

[[Page 36]]

And we must secure equal pay legislation to ensure that women and 
minority employees receive fair compensation for their work.
America's trust in the rule of law and our continuing quest for equality 
under the law have defined our history for more than 200 years. Now, as 
we look forward to a new century, we must renew our commitment to the 
spirit of our Constitution and the strong foundation of civil rights 
laws that guarantee both our freedom and our security. We must reaffirm 
our goal of building an America where all people have an equal 
opportunity to reach their full potential and where no American is 
denied his or her rights because of race, national origin, gender, 
sexual orientation, religious beliefs, or disability. By doing so, we 
will fulfill our founders' vision of a Nation where all citizens share 
equally in the blessings and protections of the law.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20 of April 7, 1961, do hereby 
proclaim May 1, 1999, as Law Day. I urge the people of the United States 
to consider anew how our laws protect our freedoms and contribute to our 
national well-being. I call upon members of the legal profession, civic 
associations, educators, librarians, public officials, and the media to 
promote the observance of this day with appropriate programs and 
activities. I also call upon public officials to display the flag of the 
United States on all government buildings throughout the day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7192 of April 30, 1999

Loyalty Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Born in the twilight of the 18th century, our great Nation has grown and 
flourished, surviving a civil war, the Great Depression, two World Wars, 
and the Cold War to emerge at the dawn of the 21st century as the 
world's best hope for freedom. The success of that journey of challenge 
and change was no accident. In 1787, when our founders came together to 
sign the Constitution and ``secure the Blessings of Liberty,'' honor 
individual rights, and guarantee equality, they laid the foundations of 
a country that would inspire the lasting loyalty and love of its 
citizens.
The courage and sacrifice of generations of Americans who have served in 
our Armed Forces have sustained the vision of our Nation's founders. 
From the fields near Lexington and Concord to the skies over Belgrade, 
nearly 50 million citizens have placed themselves in harm's way to 
defend our freedom, promote our values, and advance our interests around 
the world. Many of them have died in the process, willing to make the 
ultimate sacrifice out of loyalty and devotion to our beloved country.

[[Page 37]]

Millions of other generous men and women have proved their loyalty here 
at home. They have enriched the lives of their fellow Americans by 
volunteering in civic, religious, and school organizations. Throughout 
the decades, they have worked to expand America's promise of justice and 
equality to all our people, promoting civil rights, economic and 
educational opportunity, and political empowerment. In every era, they 
have worked to address this country's challenges and renew our legacy of 
citizen service. In doing so, they have strengthened our Nation from 
within and provided a symbol of hope around the world for those who seek 
refuge in a land where individual rights are revered and where their 
children can grow up in peace and freedom.
Recognizing the importance of loyalty to the continued strength of our 
country and success of our democracy, the Congress, by Public Law 85-
529, has designated May 1 of each year as ``Loyalty Day.'' On this day, 
let us reflect with pride on our great country and remember with 
gratitude the contributions of the many loyal and courageous Americans 
who have given so much of themselves both at home and around the world 
to preserve our freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1999, as Loyalty Day. I urge all 
Americans to recognize the heritage of American freedom, to honor the 
memory of those who have served and sacrificed in defense of that 
freedom, and to express our loyalty to our Nation through appropriate 
patriotic programs, ceremonies, and activities. I also call upon 
Government officials to display the flag of the United States in support 
of this national observance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7193 of May 5, 1999

National Day of Prayer, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From our earliest days, whether in times of joy or of challenge, 
Americans have raised their hearts and voices in prayer. On the Great 
Plains, American Indians prayed for peace and for blessings upon their 
children and their friends. The Pilgrims prayed from the moment they 
first set foot on this continent. Our Nation's founders prayed as they 
forged a democracy based on freedom and respect for human rights. Our 
military leaders and the millions of men and women who have served in 
our Armed Forces have prayed in the midst of every conflict in which our 
Nation has fought. And so it continues to this day, as Americans of 
every race, background, and creed pray in churches, mosques, synagogues, 
temples, and their own

[[Page 38]]

homes for guidance, wisdom, and courage in confronting the challenges 
before us.
We can pray openly thanks to the religious freedom guaranteed for us by 
the First Amendment to the Constitution. That freedom and the diversity 
of faiths it has fostered are among America's most important 
achievements. They have made our Nation a beacon for generations of 
people from around the world who have traveled here seeking to worship 
according to their conscience without fear of coercion or constraint.
On this National Day of Prayer, observed so soon after the tragedy in 
Littleton, Colorado, and the tornadoes that devastated communities in 
Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma, we are more keenly aware than ever of the 
power and solace we find in prayer. Throughout the days that have 
followed the deaths of and injury to so many of our fellow citizens, 
Americans have united in prayer for those who died or were harmed, for 
the comfort and peace of their families, for the wisdom to heal our 
society, and for the strength to overcome such tragedies. For as Martin 
Luther King, Jr., so eloquently said, ``When our days become dreary with 
low-hovering clouds of despair, and when our nights become darker than a 
thousand midnights, let us remember that there is a creative force in 
this universe . . . a power that is able to make a way out of no way and 
transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows.''
The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, has called on our citizens to 
reaffirm the role of prayer in our society and to honor the religious 
diversity our freedom permits by recognizing annually a ``National Day 
of Prayer.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 6, 1999, as a National Day of Prayer. I 
encourage the citizens of this great Nation to pray, each in his or her 
own manner, seeking strength from God to face the problems of today, 
requesting guidance for the uncertainties of tomorrow, and giving thanks 
for the rich blessings that our country has enjoyed throughout its 
history.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7194 of May 5, 1999

Mother's Day 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

There is nothing more precious than the bond between a mother and her 
child. With unconditional love and infinite patience, our mothers 
nurture us throughout our lives, helping us to meet life's challenges 
and achieve our dreams. Mothers--whether biological or adoptive, foster 
or stepmothers--are the cornerstones of our families, and our families 
are the

[[Page 39]]

foundation of our Nation. Mothers are the bridges that link America's 
best promise to its brightest reality.
The role of women has changed dramatically in the last half-century, 
bringing exciting new opportunities as well as fresh challenges. Today, 
our mothers can be mayors and managers, heads of households and 
homemakers--yet they still make us the center of their lives and the 
focus of their love. Regardless of whether they work inside or outside 
the home, we still turn to our mothers when we need reassurance, advice, 
or comfort. Devotion and love, loyalty and selflessness--these are the 
traits that define motherhood.
For 85 years, we have reserved the second Sunday in May as a special day 
to honor our mothers for their strength, nobility, and generosity. In so 
many ways, we owe our successes--and those of our Nation--to the loving 
influence of our mothers. Although we can never repay them for their 
gift of life and love, we can honor them in person or cherish their 
beloved memory. The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 
(38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May of each year as 
``Mother's Day'' and requested the President to call for its appropriate 
observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 9, 1999, as Mother's Day. I urge all 
Americans to express their love and appreciation for their mothers on 
this day and every day and to observe the day with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7195 of May 10, 1999

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Whether working in big cities, suburban communities, or small rural 
towns, America's law enforcement officers serve each day as a defense 
against the forces of crime and brutality. These courageous men and 
women defend our lives with their own. All too often they pay the 
ultimate price for their dedication, as America saw again this past year 
when an armed intruder invaded the United States Capitol and gunned down 
Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson. These brave men 
were husbands, fathers, neighbors, and friends. We must honor and 
remember their sacrifice and the loss of the loved ones they left 
behind.
We must also remember that the heroes who died defending the U.S. 
Capitol were just 2 of the 61 law enforcement officers killed in the 
line of duty last year. Firearms took all but 3 of these lives. In 
addition, 78 officers died

[[Page 40]]

in tragic accidents. All of their memories live on, not only with their 
friends and families, but also in the hearts of all of us who enjoy 
safer, more peaceful lives because of their dedicated service.
This week we honor with special gratitude the nearly 600,000 highly 
trained law enforcement personnel who serve our Nation each day. Whether 
working undercover against drug pushers, gang leaders, and terrorists; 
apprehending fugitives; responding to domestic violence calls; or 
arresting drunk drivers, these courageous men and women uphold their 
pledge to preserve the peace and promote the public's safety. In large 
part because of their skill and determination, crime rates in our Nation 
have fallen to the lowest point in 25 years, with the murder rate at its 
lowest level in 30 years. But the war on crime is a constant and 
dangerous struggle, and during Police Week--and especially on Peace 
Officers Memorial Day--we honor those who serve on the front lines of 
that battle.
By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962 (76 Stat. 676), the 
Congress has authorized and requested the President to designate May 15 
of each year as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and the week in which it 
falls as ``Police Week,'' and, by Public Law 103-322 (36 U.S.C. 167), 
has requested that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers 
Memorial Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 1999, as Peace Officers Memorial Day 
and May 9 through 15, 1999, as Police Week. I call upon the people of 
the United States to observe these occasions with appropriate 
ceremonies, programs, and activities. I also request the Governors of 
the States and of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, as well as the 
appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the 
flag of the United States be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers 
Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the 
United States and all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also 
invite all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes 
on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7196 of May 17, 1999

World Trade Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

World Trade Week provides a valuable opportunity to recognize the 
enormous importance of exports to the United States economy and our way 
of life. In recent years, exports have contributed to almost one-third 
of our economic growth, helping to make today's economy the strongest in 
a generation. Unemployment is at a 30-year low, business investment is 
booming, and private sector growth is on the rise. Every day, an 
increasing num

[[Page 41]]

ber of U.S. companies and farmers realize how crucial exports are to 
their bottom lines. Every day, more and more American workers benefit 
from the fact that exporting firms pay higher salaries, experience fewer 
closings, and generate jobs at a faster rate than do firms that do not 
export. That is why we must continue to open markets and expand trade 
opportunities. At the same time, we must work to ensure that increased 
international trade benefits the world's people, promotes the dignity of 
work, and protects the environment and the rights of workers.
As important as world trade is to our economy today, we are only 
beginning to utilize the commercial potential of the newest 
international marketplace: the World Wide Web. Today the Internet 
connects nearly 150 million people around the world. Each day 52,000 
additional Americans join that number, and users are making as many as 
27 million purchases on the Web each day. Forecasts predict that, in 
just a few years, global electronic commerce--e-commerce--will grow to 
more than $300 billion annually. By 2005 Internet usage in countries 
around the world may account for more than $1 trillion worth of global 
commerce.
Recognizing the enormous power and promise that e-commerce holds for 
American businesses and consumers, my Administration is working to build 
a framework for global electronic commerce that will keep competition 
free and vigorous, protect consumers, guarantee privacy, and give 
users--not governments--the responsibility of supervising Internet 
trade. Working with the Congress, industry, and State and local 
officials, we have enacted legislation that places a 3-year moratorium 
on new and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce. We also ratified 
an international treaty to protect intellectual property online. Last 
year, representatives of 132 countries followed our lead and signed a 
WTO Ministerial Declaration to refrain from imposing customs duties on 
electronic commerce.
Working with our trading partners, industry, and consumer advocates, we 
are extending traditional consumer protections to the arena of 
electronic commerce. Without imposing burdensome regulations that might 
stifle growth and innovation, we have offered incentives to online 
companies to give consumers the protections they need to conduct 
business on the Internet with security and confidence. Finally, we are 
working to speed the completion of the global information 
infrastructure, a series of networks that sends messages and images at 
the speed of light.
Appropriately, the theme of this year's World Trade Day observance is 
``Trade, a Worldwide Web of Opportunity.'' Linking businesses and 
customers around the clock, 7 days a week, the Web provides even the 
smallest companies with the opportunity to do business on a global 
scale. We are about to enter a new and unprecedented era in world trade, 
and America's businesses, workers, and consumers are poised to embrace 
this opportunity and continue our leadership of the world economy.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 
1999, as World Trade Week. I invite the people of the United States to 
observe this week with events, trade shows, and educational programs 
that celebrate the benefits of international trade to our economy.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of

[[Page 42]]

the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

<R05>
Proclamation 7197 of May 17, 1999

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 
1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout America's history, our transportation system has played a 
profound role in the security and development of our Nation. As early as 
the Revolutionary War, America's merchant marine carried cargo to help 
defend our national interests and uphold our democratic ideals. In the 
1800's, as many Americans migrated westward, new roads and canals 
facilitated travel and trade, helping to unify our young country and to 
bolster our growing economy. And in the 20th century, few innovations 
have had the same far-reaching effect on our society as the airplane--
now a critical part of our national defense and our robust economy.
Representing 11 percent of the U.S. economy and related to one in every 
seven American jobs, today's transportation industry continues to grow 
and thrive. Millions of Americans rely on its readiness for business and 
leisure travel. And we can be pleased by the improved safety of our 
transportation system. In 1998, the rate of traffic fatalities in 
America fell to its lowest level since record-keeping began in 1966. 
Last year also marked a milestone in aviation safety when, for the first 
time in our history, there were no reported passenger fatalities on 
scheduled U.S. air carriers.
Securing the continued strength and safety of our transportation system 
is among my highest priorities as President. My Administration has acted 
aggressively to improve the security of our rail system, and, by 
initiating a new program to encourage Americans to buckle their seat 
belts, we are working to improve the safety of vehicular travel. As we 
face the challenges of a new century, we must build on these 
achievements to ensure that our transportation system remains the finest 
in the world.
Last year, I was proud to sign into law the Transportation Equity Act 
for the 21st Century (TEA-21), the largest public works legislation in 
our Nation's history. TEA-21 invests $198 billion in our transportation 
infrastructure. The Livable Communities for the 21st Century Initiative 
represents another integral part of our transportation strategy for the 
coming century, providing communities with tools and resources to ease 
traffic congestion, preserve green space, and pursue wise regional 
growth strategies. These comprehensive programs will help communities 
across America create a higher quality of living and secure sustainable 
economic growth as we work to forge more livable communities for 
ourselves and for the next generation of Americans.
In recognition of the ongoing contributions of our Nation's 
transportation system and in honor of the devoted professionals who work 
to sustain its

[[Page 43]]

tradition of excellence, the United States Congress, by joint resolution 
approved May 16, 1957 (36 U.S.C. 120), has designated the third Friday 
in May of each year as ``National Defense Transportation Day'' and, by 
joint resolution approved May 14, 1962 (36 U.S.C. 133), declared that 
the week in which that Friday falls be designated ``National 
Transportation Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 21, 1999, as National Defense 
Transportation Day and May 16 through May 22, 1999, as National 
Transportation Week. I urge all Americans to observe these occasions 
with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.

<R05>
Proclamation 7198 of May 20, 1999

National Safe Boating Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In America, a country bordered by oceans and blessed with numerous lakes 
and rivers, recreational boating enjoys a long and proud tradition. From 
generation to generation, families pass on their appreciation of the 
water and share the pleasures of nature's beauty and bounty. Annually, 
more than 74 million Americans take part in recreational boating 
activities with their families and friends.
While boating is a wonderful form of recreation, it can also present 
many dangers. Human error and poor judgment contribute to most 
recreational boating accidents. Recent statistics indicate that 86 
percent of all boating accidents are attributable to operator-controlled 
factors, such as excessive speed, inattention, failure to follow 
required navigation rules and practices, and lack of knowledge about 
boats and the boating environment.
Even with adequate training and preparation, boaters can still have 
accidents. That is why it is crucial for everyone using our waterways to 
wear a life jacket. Recent U.S. Coast Guard statistics indicate that 90 
percent of drowning victims were not wearing life preservers. Most of 
the victims were small boat users--many in remote areas. In such 
potentially dangerous circumstances, wearing a life jacket is essential. 
This message is so important that the National Safe Boating Campaign 
theme for the second year is ``Boat Smart from the Start! Wear Your Life 
Jacket!''
Many recreational boating organizations, including the National Safe 
Boating Council and the National Association of State Boating Law 
Administrators, as well as the U.S. Coast Guard, other Federal agencies, 
and State and local governments continue to help save lives by reminding 
us of the importance of wearing life preservers and following safe 
navigation rules. However, each individual must take responsibility for 
his or her personal

[[Page 44]]

safety and for the well-being of family and friends. By taking 
appropriate precautions, we can all enjoy our Nation's waterways safely 
and securely.
In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as 
amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually 
the 7-day period ending on the last Friday before Memorial Day as 
``National Safe Boating Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22 through 28, 1999, as National Safe 
Boating Week. I encourage the governors of the 50 States and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, to join in observing this occasion 
and to urge all Americans to practice safe boating habits not only 
during this week, but also throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7199 of May 21, 1999

National Maritime Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The history of the United States has always been linked to the sea. For 
more than 2 centuries, American ships and crews have made enormous 
contributions to the strength of our economy, the security of our 
shores, and the success of our efforts to create a more peaceful, 
prosperous world.
Today's U.S. Merchant Marine is building on that rich maritime heritage. 
Our commercial ships and marine infrastructure--and the dedicated men 
and women who are part of our maritime industry and U.S. Merchant 
Marine--continue to meet the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly 
changing marketplace and the expanding globalization of trade. Our 
merchant fleet is a key component of our Nation's intermodal 
transportation system, carrying more than one billion tons of cargo 
between domestic ports and supporting our connection to overseas 
markets. The fleet helps facilitate our engagement in world affairs and 
helps protect U.S. national security interests.
Recognizing that a strong America requires a strong merchant marine, my 
Administration has worked closely with the Congress to promote the 
development and maintenance of a modern, efficient, well-balanced 
merchant fleet, capable of facilitating international commerce and 
meeting the military needs of our Armed Forces during times of conflict 
or national emergency. Through the Maritime Security Program and the 
Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement, which implement the Maritime 
Security Act of 1996, we have forged new public-private partnerships to 
ensure that our

[[Page 45]]

country will maintain a modern commercial fleet owned and operated by 
U.S. citizens and crewed by well-trained, highly skilled American 
sailors. We have strengthened U.S. shipyards through the National 
Shipbuilding Initiative. We also have helped keep our shipbuilding 
industry competitive in the global marketplace by providing financing 
guarantees, granting tax deferrals, and making it easier to operate 
ships under the U.S. flag.
The United States Merchant Marine has served our Nation boldly and well 
through challenge and change. As we enter a new century, we must 
reaffirm our commitment to this proud legacy. We must maintain the 
strength and vitality of our merchant fleet and the skills and training 
of the men and women who have made America a great maritime Nation. By 
doing so, we will ensure that U.S.-flag vessels continue to sail the 
world's oceans, preserving our leadership of the global economy, 
strengthening our prosperity, and defending our freedom for generations 
to come.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the 
Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated 
May 22 of each year as ``National Maritime Day'' and has authorized and 
requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its 
appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 1999, as National Maritime Day. I 
urge all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities and by displaying the flag of the United 
States in their homes and in their communities. I also request that all 
merchant ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7200 of May 22, 1999

Small Business Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From the Industrial Revolution to the Information Age, small businesses 
have powered the American economy and created much of our prosperity. 
Generations of entrepreneurs have found in small businesses an outlet 
for their creativity, the source of their livelihood, and a chance to 
share in the American Dream. Millions of American consumers have found 
in small businesses the innovative products and vital services they need 
to improve the quality of their lives.
Today, America's 24 million small businesses employ more than half our 
country's work force and generate more than $16 trillion in revenue--
more than 50 percent of our gross domestic product. Small firms are also 
a true avenue of opportunity for women and minorities, for older and 
younger

[[Page 46]]

workers, and for part-time employees and those formerly on public 
assistance. They provide 67 percent of working Americans with their 
first job and their initial on-the-job training in basic work skills.
My Administration is deeply committed to creating an environment in 
which small businesses can thrive. Through programs administered by the 
Small Business Administration (SBA)--such as the business loan guarantee 
program, the economic development loan program, the microloan program, 
the small business investment company program, and the disaster loan and 
surety bond programs--we have given small business owners access to 
financial assistance. Last year alone, the SBA guaranteed almost $11 
billion in loans to small businesses, provided technical and management 
assistance to almost a million people, and helped entrepreneurs compete 
for more than $33 billion in Federal contracts. Through tax relief and 
regulatory streamlining and by opening overseas markets and providing 
export assistance, we are helping America's small businesses compete 
successfully in the global marketplace.
The men and women who own and manage America's small businesses have 
made enormous contributions to the technological innovations, job 
growth, and prosperity we enjoy today. But those contributions cannot be 
measured in dollars and cents alone; entrepreneurs give back to their 
communities in myriad ways, making them better places in which to live 
and work. During Small Business Week, we have a special opportunity--and 
obligation--to acknowledge the achievements of small business men and 
women and to express our appreciation for the vision, energy, and effort 
they bring to their enterprises.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 23 through May 29, 
1999, as Small Business Week. I call upon Government officials and all 
the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs that celebrate the achievements of 
small business owners and encourage the development of new enterprises.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7201 of May 26, 1999

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The challenges to our Nation's peace and freedom are as old as American 
history and as new as today's headlines. They have taken many forms 
through the years, from the bitter discord of civil war at home to the 
ag

[[Page 47]]

gression of tyrants abroad. But the price of peace and freedom has 
always remained the same: the service and sacrifice of our young men and 
women in uniform.
Looking back across the decades, we marvel at the valor and 
determination of these gallant Americans who, in each generation, have 
stepped forward to preserve our freedom, defend our democracy, uphold 
our ideals, and protect our interests. The battles in which they fought 
and died--Brandywine, Gettysburg, San Juan Hill, Belleau Wood, Coral 
Sea, Inchon, Khe Sahn--are a testament to uncommon courage and 
indomitable spirit. Those who survived were forever changed. Those who 
died stay forever young in their loved ones' memories. Their final 
thoughts most likely were of home and family; their final actions 
purchased the freedom we enjoy today.
Now, on Memorial Day, our thoughts turn to them. We remember with 
profound gratitude those who took to the seas and skies in moments of 
peril for our Nation. We remember those who marched through mud or rice 
paddies, snow or sand, because they knew, as President Eisenhower 
reminded us, that ``a soldier's pack is not so heavy a burden as a 
prisoner's chains'' and that true peace is won only by those willing to 
die for it. We remember those in the Normandy American Cemetery 
overlooking Omaha Beach who, 55 years ago, relit the torch of freedom in 
a war-weary Europe. We remember those whose final resting place is 
unknown, but whose sacrifice is known to us all. The passing of time and 
the blessings of peace and prosperity can never make us forget what 
these brave Americans endured and what they lost so that right would 
triumph, freedom would survive, and our Nation would prevail.
In honor of all the courageous men and women who gave their lives in 
defense of our Nation and our fundamental ideals, I ask that every 
American say a prayer for lasting peace on this Memorial Day. I ask that 
every American remember our heroic war dead in some special way, whether 
by placing flowers on a veteran's grave, lighting a candle, observing a 
moment of silence, or saying a prayer of thanks. While we can never 
fully repay our debt to America's fallen warriors, we can remember their 
service and honor their sacrifice.
In respect and recognition of the courageous men and women to whom we 
pay tribute, the Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 11, 1950 
(64 Stat. 158), has requested the President to issue a proclamation 
calling upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial 
Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on 
that day when the American people might unite in prayer.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 31, 1999, as a day of 
prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning at 3:00 
p.m. EDT of that day as a time to join in prayer. I urge the press, 
radio, television, and all other information media to take part in this 
observance.
I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of 
government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on 
this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels 
throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and 
control, and I request the people

[[Page 48]]

of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes 
for the customary forenoon period.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7202 of May 28, 1999

To Eliminate Circumvention of the Quantitative Limitations Applicable to 
Imports of Wheat Gluten

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On March 18, 1998, the United States International Trade Commission 
(USITC) transmitted to the President a unanimous affirmative 
determination in its investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of 
1974, as amended (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2252), with respect to 
imports of wheat gluten provided for in subheadings 1109.00.10 and 
1109.00.90 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). 
Under section 202 of the Trade Act, the USITC determined that such wheat 
gluten is being imported into the United States in such increased 
quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the 
domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article. 
Further, pursuant to section 311(a) of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement Implementation Act (NAFTA Implementation Act) (19 U.S.C. 
3371(a)), the USITC made negative findings with respect to imports of 
wheat gluten from Canada and Mexico. Pursuant to section 202(e) of the 
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)), the USITC also transmitted to the 
President its recommendation on the action that would address the 
serious injury to the domestic industry and be most effective in 
facilitating the efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive 
adjustment to import competition.
2. On May 30, 1998, I issued Proclamation 7103, which implemented action 
of a type described in section 203(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 
2253(a)(3)). Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), 
and taking into account the considerations specified in section 
203(a)(2) of the Trade Act, I determined to establish quantitative 
limitations on imports of wheat gluten, provided for in HTS subheadings 
1109.00.10 and 1109.00.90, imposed for a period of 3 years plus 1 day, 
with annual increases in such quota limits of 6 percent in the second 
year and in the third year. These limitations were to apply to imports 
from all countries, and the quota quantity was to be allocated among 
such countries, except for products of Canada, Mexico, Israel, 
beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act 
and the Andean Trade Preference Act, and other developing countries that 
accounted for a minor share of wheat gluten imports that I determined to 
exclude from any restriction. Pursuant to section 203(a)(1)(A) of the 
Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1)(A)), I further determined that these 
actions would facilitate efforts by the domestic industry to make

[[Page 49]]

a positive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic 
and social benefits than costs.
3. Despite the quantitative limitations on imports of wheat gluten, 
during the first restraint period quantities of wheat gluten the product 
of the European Community have been entered in excess of the allocated 
amount.
4. Section 204(b)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(2)) authorizes 
the President to take such additional action under section 203 of the 
Trade Act as may be necessary to eliminate any circumvention of any 
action previously taken under such section. Pursuant to section 
204(b)(2) of the Trade Act, I have determined it is appropriate and 
feasible to take additional action pursuant to section 203(a)(3) of the 
Trade Act. Such action shall take the form of a reduction in the 
European Community's 1999/2000 wheat gluten quota allotment in the 
amount of 5,204,000 kg, which represents the amount of wheat gluten that 
entered the United States in excess of the European Community's 1998 
quota allocation. I determine this action is necessary to eliminate 
circumvention of the safeguard action previously undertaken in 
Proclamation 7103.
5. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 
203, 204, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:
    (1) The allocation of the quota quantity for wheat gluten for the 
restraint period from June 1, 1999, through May 31, 2000, inclusive, 
that was accorded to wheat gluten the product of the European Community 
by the Annex to Presidential Proclamation 7103 of May 30, 1998, as set 
forth in subheading 9903.11.06 of subchapter III, chapter 99 of the HTS, 
is modified by striking the allocated quota quantity set forth for the 
European Community ``25,983,000 kg'' from such subheading and by 
inserting in lieu thereof the new allocated quota quantity for the 
European Community ``20,581,000 kg''.
    (2) In order to ensure that any imports of wheat gluten the product 
of any country, or the product of the European Community, having an 
allocated share of the quantitative restraints set forth in subheadings 
9903.11.05 through 9903.11.07, inclusive, of the HTS and superior text 
thereto, are limited to the specified share during a quota period, the 
HTS is modified by adding at the end of U.S. Note 7 to subchapter III of 
chapter 99 the following new paragraph:
    L``Whenever a quantity is allocated to a country, to `other 
countries' or to the European Community under such subheadings, and the 
quota quantity specified for such country or countries or for the 
European Community has been entered for the specified restraint period, 
any shipments of wheat gluten the product of such country or countries 
or of the European Community entered in excess of such allocated quota 
quantity shall be charged to the allocation for such country or 
countries or for the European Community for the subsequent restraint 
period. If the allocated

[[Page 50]]

quantity for a country or countries or for the European Community under 
subheading 9903.11.07, including any quantity carried over from the 
restraint periods provided for in subheadings 9903.11.05 and 9903.11.06 
and charged against the appropriate allocation under subheading 
9903.11.07, has been entered, any imports in excess of the allocated 
quota quantity for a country or countries or for the European Community 
shall be entered into bonded warehouse or shall be exported, and shall 
not be entered into the customs territory of the United States until 
12:00 a.m. e.d.t. June 1, 2001. The Secretary of the Treasury is 
authorized to take any necessary action in order to ensure that no 
shipments in excess of the allocation for a country or countries or for 
the European Community for the period from June 1, 2000 through June 1, 
2001, inclusive, is entered into the customs territory of the United 
States.''
    (3) Subheading 9903.11.06 is modified by inserting after ``Other'' 
the word ``countries''.
    (4) Any provision of any previous proclamation or Executive order 
that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (5) The modifications made in this proclamation shall be effective 
with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for 
consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. e.d.t. on June 1, 1999, and shall 
continue in effect as provided until 11:59 p.m. e.d.t. on June 1, 2001, 
unless such actions are earlier expressly modified or terminated.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7203 of June 11, 1999

Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Thirty years ago this month, at the Stonewall Inn in New York City, a 
courageous group of citizens resisted harassment and mistreatment, 
setting in motion a chain of events that would become known as the 
Stonewall Uprising and the birth of the modern gay and lesbian civil 
rights movement. Gays and lesbians, their families and friends, 
celebrate the anniversary of Stonewall every June in America as Gay and 
Lesbian Pride Month; and, earlier this month, the National Park Service 
added the Stonewall Inn, as well as the nearby park and neighborhood 
streets surrounding it, to the National Register of Historic Places.
I am proud of the measures my Administration has taken to end 
discrimination against gays and lesbians and ensure that they have the 
same rights guaranteed to their fellow Americans. Last year, I signed an 
Executive order that amends Federal equal employment opportunity policy 
to prohibit dis

[[Page 51]]

crimination in the Federal civilian work force based on sexual 
orientation. We have also banned discrimination based on sexual 
orientation in the granting of security clearances. As a result of these 
and other policies, gay and lesbian Americans serve openly and proudly 
throughout the Federal Government. My Administration is also working 
with congressional leaders to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination 
Act, which would prohibit most private employers from firing workers 
solely because of their sexual orientation.
America's diversity is our greatest strength. But, while we have come a 
long way on our journey toward tolerance, understanding, and mutual 
respect, we still have a long way to go in our efforts to end 
discrimination. During the past year, people across our country have 
been shaken by violent acts that struck at the heart of what it means to 
be an American and at the values that have always defined us as a 
Nation. In 1997, the most recent year for which we have statistics, 
there were more than 8,000 reported hate crimes in our country--almost 
one an hour. Now is the time for us to take strong and decisive action 
to end all hate crimes, and I reaffirm my pledge to work with the 
Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
But we cannot achieve true tolerance merely through legislation; we must 
change hearts and minds as well. Our greatest hope for a just society is 
to teach our children to respect one another, to appreciate our 
differences, and to recognize the fundamental values that we hold in 
common. As part of our efforts to achieve this goal, earlier this 
spring, I announced that the Departments of Justice and Education will 
work in partnership with educational and other private sector 
organizations to reach out to students and teach them that our diversity 
is a gift. In addition, the Department of Education has issued landmark 
guidance that explains Federal standards against sexual harassment and 
prohibits sexual harassment of all students regardless of their sexual 
orientation; and I have ordered the Education Department's civil rights 
office to step up its enforcement of anti-discrimination and harassment 
rules. That effort has resulted in a groundbreaking guide that provides 
practical guidance to school administrators and teachers for developing 
a comprehensive approach to protecting all students, including gays and 
lesbians, from harassment and violence.
Since our earliest days as a Nation, Americans have strived to make real 
the ideals of equality and freedom so eloquently expressed in our 
Declaration of Independence and Constitution. We now have a rare 
opportunity to enter a new century and a new millennium as one country, 
living those principles, recognizing our common values, and building on 
our shared strengths.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 1999 as Gay and 
Lesbian Pride Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month 
with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that celebrate our 
diversity, and to remember throughout the year the gay and lesbian 
Americans whose many and varied contributions have enriched our national 
life.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of

[[Page 52]]

the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7204 of June 11, 1999

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Since its adoption in 1777 by the Continental Congress, the Stars and 
Stripes has symbolized the promise of America. This promise--of 
equality, justice under the law, freedom from tyranny, and inclusion in 
a government of the people--beckons immigrants to our shores today just 
as it has for more than two centuries. Each time the Stars and Stripes 
is raised over our homes, public buildings, schools, or community 
gathering places, it proclaims that our Nation's great experiment in 
democracy is alive and well.
The stately design of the Stars and Stripes celebrates America's 
diversity while proclaiming the unity of our Nation. Its white stars, 
whose shifting constellation has chronicled the growth of our Nation, 
are the ancient symbols of a sovereign domain; they lie on a field of 
blue that represents loyalty, justice, and truth. Thus our flag 
describes the unique Republic designed by our founders, in which States 
that vary widely in geography, history, and culture are joined in 
sustaining the common goals and ideals our Nation holds dear. The Stars 
and Stripes reminds us that, wherever we come from across our country, 
we are all first and foremost Americans.
Today, as we stand at the threshold of the 21st century, we have a 
special opportunity to renew our flag's heritage and to honor the spirit 
of resilience in our national character that it signifies. As part of 
this effort, the White House Millennium Council's ``Save America's 
Treasures Project,'' created by the First Lady, is helping to restore 
and preserve the original Star-Spangled Banner at the Smithsonian's 
National Museum of American History. This banner, ``so gallantly 
streaming'' as the British navy retreated from Baltimore Harbor after a 
failed assault on Fort McHenry in 1814, is immortalized in the bold and 
patriotic words of Francis Scott Key that now serve as our National 
Anthem. From the fledgling Nation of Key's time, defiantly opposing 
domination by European powers, the United States has evolved into a 
Nation of unrivaled influence in the world with an unparalleled 
commitment to democracy and human rights. During Flag Day and National 
Flag Week, we honor this incredible journey and the bright future it has 
made possible.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by joint 
resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of 
each year as ``Flag Day'' and requested the President to issue an annual 
proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the Flag 
of the United States on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress 
also requested the President, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966 
(80 Stat. 194), to issue annually a proclamation designating the week in 
which June 14 falls

[[Page 53]]

as ``National Flag Week'' and calling upon all citizens of the United 
States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 1999, as Flag Day and the week 
beginning June 13, 1999, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate 
officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during 
that week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National 
Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other 
suitable places.
I also call upon the people of the United States to observe with pride 
and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, 
also set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor our 
Nation, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, 
and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of 
June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7205 of June 18, 1999

Father's Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Each year on Father's Day, Americans take special joy in remembering the 
many cherished moments they have shared with their fathers through the 
years. Reading stories before bedtime, playing catch after dinner, 
camping out in the backyard, sharing driving lessons--at these moments 
and countless others throughout a lifetime, devoted fathers are there to 
guide their sons and daughters, to instill confidence in them, and to 
provide for them and protect them in times of need.
The impact of these moments on children's development and future is 
immeasurable. Although children may not understand it until they become 
parents themselves, these are the times when fathers impart to their 
sons and daughters strong values and teach them important lessons about 
love, responsibility, faith, hard work, and determination. In these 
moments, fathers imbue in their children the strength and self-esteem 
they need to achieve their full potential.
As children grow and mature--from toddlers carried on their fathers' 
shoulders to teenagers who need help navigating the challenges of 
adolescence to young men and women who need guidance on life, love, 
family, and career--their relationships with their fathers change as 
well. Yet, the need for a father's friendship and wisdom continues to 
grow; and throughout all the seasons of life, fathers remain role 
models, teachers, heroes, and friends.

[[Page 54]]

Vice President Gore and I have challenged fathers to be actively 
involved in their children's lives and to provide both emotional and 
financial support. Last June, the Vice President released a report 
showing that children who grow up without fathers are more likely to do 
poorly in school, to get into trouble with the law, and to have 
difficulty in getting and keeping a job. But our fathers cannot always 
meet their responsibilities to their children without help. That is why 
it is crucial that we lift up our fathers through efforts like the 
reauthorization of the Welfare-to-Work program so that more low income 
fathers can work, pay child support, and become more involved with their 
children.
We can never truly repay our fathers--whether biological, adoptive, 
foster, or stepfather--for their many precious gifts to us, for their 
steadfast faith in our potential and abilities, for their unwavering 
devotion and unconditional love. We can, however, express our deep 
appreciation for all they have done and thank them for the many 
sacrifices they have made to create a better life for us. There is no 
more fitting national tribute to fathers than reserving a day in their 
honor, and there is no more appropriate celebration of their profound 
impact on the lives of their children and the strength of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved 
April 24, 1972 (36 U.S.C. 142a), do hereby proclaim Sunday, June 20, 
1999, as Father's Day. I invite the States, communities across the 
country, and all the citizens of the United States to observe this day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities to express our deep 
appreciation and abiding love for our fathers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7206 of June 30, 1999

To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized
System of Preferences and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

    1. Pursuant to section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2462), the President may designate countries as 
beneficiary developing countries and least-developed beneficiary 
developing countries for purposes of the Generalized System of 
Preferences (GSP).
    2. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary developing countries, except those 
designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries, are 
subject to competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment 
afforded under the GSP to eligible articles.

[[Page 55]]

    3. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(C)), a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary 
developing country with respect to an eligible article may be 
redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such 
article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the 
competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)) during the preceding calendar year.
    4. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(F)), the President may disregard the competitive need 
limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 
U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from 
any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of 
the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding 
calendar year does not exceed the applicable amount set forth in section 
503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).
    5. Pursuant to section 503(d) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)), 
the President may waive the application of the competitive need 
limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(A)) with respect to any eligible article of any beneficiary 
developing country if certain conditions are met.
    6. Section 507(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2467(2)) provides that 
in the case of an association of countries which is a free trade area or 
customs union, or which is contributing to comprehensive regional 
economic integration among its members through appropriate means, 
including, but not limited to, the reduction of duties, the President 
may provide that all members of such association other than members 
which are barred from designation under section 502(b) of the 1974 Act 
(19 U.S.C. 2462(b)) shall be treated as one country for purposes of 
title V of the 1974 Act.
    7. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and having taken account 
of the eligibility criteria set forth therein, I have determined that 
Gabon and Mongolia should be designated as beneficiary developing 
countries for purposes of the GSP. Further, I have determined that the 
names of two previously designated beneficiary developing countries 
should be modified.
    8. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and having taken account 
of the eligibility criteria set forth therein, I have determined that 
the suspension pursuant to Proclamation 6575 of June 25, 1993, of 
preferential treatment for Mauritania as a least-developed beneficiary 
developing country under the GSP should be ended.
    9. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined that certain beneficiary developing countries should not 
receive preferential tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to 
certain eligible articles imported in quantities that exceed the 
applicable competitive need limitation.
    10. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(C) of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined that certain countries should be redesignated as beneficiary 
developing countries with respect to certain eligible articles that 
previously had been imported in quantities exceeding the competitive 
need limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act.
    11. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have 
determined that the competitive need limitation provided in section 
503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)

[[Page 56]]

should be waived with respect to certain eligible articles from certain 
beneficiary developing countries.
    12. Pursuant to section 503(d) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that the competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 
1974 Act should be waived with respect to certain eligible articles from 
certain beneficiary developing countries. I have received the advice of 
the International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the 
United States are likely to be adversely affected by such waivers, and I 
have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations 
described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, that such waivers 
are in the national economic interest of the United States.
    13. Pursuant to section 507(2) of the 1974 Act, I have determined 
that Cambodia should be added to the list of countries identified in 
general note 4(a) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(HTS) as members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
that shall be treated as one country for purposes of title V of the 1974 
Act.
    14. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions 
of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions 
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to provide for the designation of Gabon and Mongolia as 
beneficiary developing countries under the GSP, and to modify the names 
of two previously designated beneficiary developing countries, general 
note 4(a) to the HTS is modified as provided in sections A(1), A(2) and 
A(3) of Annex I to this proclamation and general note 4(b) to the HTS is 
modified as provided in section B of Annex I to this proclamation.
    (2) In order to provide for the addition of Cambodia to the list of 
members of ASEAN that shall be treated as one country for purposes of 
title V of the 1974 Act, general note 4(a) to the HTS is modified as 
provided in section A(4) of Annex I to this proclamation.
    (3) In order to provide for the restoration of preferential 
treatment for Mauritania as a least-developed beneficiary developing 
country under the GSP, general note 4(a) to the HTS is modified as 
provided in section C(1) of Annex I to this proclamation and general 
note 4(b) to the HTS is modified as provided in section C(2) of Annex I 
to this proclamation.
    (4) In order to provide that certain countries that have not been 
treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more 
eligible articles should be designated as beneficiary developing 
countries with respect to such article or articles for purposes of the 
GSP, and that certain countries should not be treated as beneficiary 
developing countries with respect to one or more eligible articles for 
purposes of the GSP, general note 4(d) to the HTS is modified as 
provided in section D of Annex I to this proclamation and the Rates of 
Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the HTS subheadings enumerated in section E 
of Annex I to this proclamation is modified as provided in such section.

[[Page 57]]

    (5) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 
Act shall apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to 
the beneficiary developing countries set forth in Annex II to this 
proclamation.
    (6) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (7)(a) The modifications to the HTS made by Annex I to this 
proclamation shall be effective on the dates specified in such annex.
      (b) The action taken in Annex II to this proclamation shall be 
effective on the date of signature of this proclamation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7207 of July 1, 1999

To Extend Nondiscriminatory Treatment (Normal Trade Relations Treatment) 
to Products of Mongolia and To Implement an Agreement To Eliminate 
Tariffs on Certain Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Intermediates

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. The United States has had in effect a bilateral Agreement on Trade 
Relations with Mongolia since 1991 and has provided normal trade 
relations treatment to the products of Mongolia since that time. I have 
found Mongolia to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration 
requirements of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (the ``Trade Act'') 
(19 U.S.C. 2432).
2. Pursuant to section 2424(b)(1) of Public Law 106-36, and having due 
regard for the findings of the Congress in section 2424(a) of said Law, 
I hereby determine that title IV of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2431-2441) 
should no longer apply to Mongolia.
3. On November 13, 1998, members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
including the United States and 21 other major trading countries, 
announced in the WTO an agreement to eliminate tariffs on certain 
pharmaceuticals and chemical intermediates that were the subject of 
reciprocal duty elimination negotiations during the Uruguay Round of 
Multilateral Trade Negotiations (the ``Uruguay Round''). A similar 
agreement between the United States and 16 other major trading countries 
eliminating tariffs on enumerated pharmaceuticals and chemical 
intermediates was implemented for the United States on April 1, 1997, by 
Proclamation 6982, adding such goods to the scope of the agreement on 
pharmaceutical products reached at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
and reflected in Schedule XX-United States of America, annexed to the 
Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (1994) 
(Schedule XX).
4. Section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 
3521(b)) authorizes the President to proclaim the modification of any 
duty or staged rate reduction of any duty set forth in Schedule XX for 
products that were the subject of reciprocal duty elimination 
negotiations during the Uruguay Round, if the United States agrees to 
such action in a multilateral negotiation under the auspices of the WTO, 
and after compliance with the consultation and layover requirements of 
section 115 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3524). Section 111(b) also authorizes 
the President to proclaim such modifications as are necessary to reflect 
such duty treatment in Schedule XX by means of rectifications thereof.
5. On April 29, 1999, pursuant to section 115 of the URAA, the United 
States Trade Representative (USTR) submitted a report to the Committee 
on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
Finance of the Senate (``the Committees'') that sets forth the proposed 
tariff eliminations, together with the advice received from the 
appropriate private sector advisory committee and the United States 
International Trade Commission regarding the proposed tariff 
eliminations. During the 60-day period thereafter, the USTR consulted 
with the Committees on the proposed actions.

[[Page 63]]

6. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States (HTS) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and 
of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, 
including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any 
rate of duty or other import restriction.
7. Pursuant to section 111(b) of the URAA, I have determined that 
Schedule XX should be modified to reflect the implementation by the 
United States of the multilateral agreement on certain pharmaceuticals 
and chemical intermediates negotiated under the auspices of the WTO. In 
addition, I have determined that the pharmaceuticals appendix to the HTS 
should be modified to reflect the duty eliminations provided in such 
agreement, and to make certain minor technical corrections in the 
identification of particular products in order to ensure that products 
are accorded the intended duty treatment.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 
2424(b)(2) of Public Law 106-36, section 111(b) of the URAA, and section 
604 of the Trade Act, do hereby proclaim that:
    (1) Nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations treatment) 
shall be extended to the products of Mongolia, which shall no longer be 
subject to title IV of the Trade Act.
    (2) The extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of 
Mongolia shall be effective as of the date of signature of this 
proclamation.
    (3) In order to implement the multilateral agreement negotiated 
under the auspices of the WTO to eliminate tariffs on certain 
pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediates, and to make 
technical corrections in the tariff treatment accorded to such products, 
the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.
    (4) Such modifications to the HTS shall be effective with respect to 
articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or 
after the dates set forth in the Annex for the respective actions taken.
    (5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of July, 
in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-
third.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7208 of July 7, 1999

To Facilitate Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Lamb 
Meat

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On April 5, 1999, the United States International Trade Commission 
(USITC) transmitted to the President a unanimous affirmative 
determination in its investigation under section 202 of the Trade Act of 
1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2252), with respect to 
imports of fresh, chilled, or frozen lamb meat, provided for in heading 
0204 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Under 
section 202 of the Trade Act, the USITC determined that such lamb meat 
is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as 
to be a substantial cause of the threat of serious injury to the 
domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive article. 
Further, the USITC, pursuant to section 311(a) of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``NAFTA Implementation 
Act'') (19 U.S.C. 3371(a)), made negative findings with respect to 
imports of lamb meat from Canada and Mexico. The USITC also transmitted 
to the President its recommendation made pursuant to section 202(e) of 
the Trade Act with respect to the action that would address the threat 
of serious injury to the domestic industry and be most effective in 
facilitating the efforts of the domestic industry to make a positive 
adjustment to import competition.
2. Pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), and after 
taking into account the considerations specified in section 203(a)(2) of 
the Trade Act, I have determined to implement action of a type described 
in section 203(a)(3). However, pursuant to section 312(a) of the NAFTA 
Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3372(a)), I have determined that imports 
from Canada and Mexico, considered individually, do not account for a 
substantial share of total imports and do not contribute importantly to 
the threat of serious injury found by the USITC. Accordingly, pursuant 
to section 312(b) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3372(b)), I 
have excluded lamb meat the product of Canada or Mexico from the action 
I am taking under section 203 of the Trade Act.
3. Such action shall take the form of a tariff-rate quota on imports of 
fresh, chilled, or frozen lamb meat, provided for in HTS subheadings 
0204.10.00, 0204.22.20, 0204.23.20, 0204.30.00, 0204.42.20, and 
0204.43.20, imposed for a period of 3 years plus 1 day, with annual 
increases in the within-quota quantities in the second and third years, 
as provided for in the annex to this proclamation.
4. Except for products of Canada, Mexico, Israel, beneficiary countries 
under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) and the Andean 
Trade Preference Act (ATPA), and other developing countries that have 
accounted for a minor share of lamb meat imports, which shall all be 
excluded from this restriction, such tariff-rate quota shall apply to 
imports of lamb meat from all other countries and the in-quota quantity 
in each year shall be allocated among such countries. Pursuant to 
section 203(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1)(A)), I have 
further determined that these actions will facilitate efforts by the 
domestic industry to make a posi

[[Page 72]]

tive adjustment to import competition and provide greater economic and 
social benefits than costs.
5. Section 604 of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes 
the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant 
provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, 
and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
sections 203 and 604 of the Trade Act, and section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, do proclaim that:
    (1) In order to establish a tariff-rate quota on imports of fresh, 
chilled, or frozen lamb meat classified in HTS subheadings 0204.10.00, 
0204.22.20, 0204.23.20, 0204.30.00, 0204.42.20, and 0204.43.20, 
subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as provided in the 
annex to this proclamation.
    (2) Such imported lamb meat that is the product of Canada, Mexico, 
Israel, and of beneficiary countries under the CBERA and the ATPA, and 
of developing countries listed in general note 4(a) to the HTS, shall be 
excluded from the tariff-rate quota established by this proclamation, 
and such imports shall not be counted toward the tariff-rate quota 
limits that trigger the over-quota rates of duty.
    (3) In the event that a quota quantity established by this 
proclamation and allocated to a country or to ``other countries'' is 
significantly underutilized, the United States Trade Representative is 
authorized to reallocate all or part of the unfilled portion of such 
quota quantity to any other country or countries and, upon publication 
of notice in the Federal Register, to modify the HTS provisions created 
by the annex to this proclamation to reflect any such reallocation.
    (4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
    (5) The modifications to the HTS made by this proclamation, 
including the annex hereto, shall be effective with respect to goods 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 
a.m. e.d.t. on July 22, 1999, and shall continue in effect as provided 
in the annex to this proclamation, unless such actions are earlier 
expressly modified or terminated.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7209 of July 16, 1999

Captive Nations Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This month Americans mark 223 years of freedom from tyranny. We 
celebrate the vision of our founders who, in signing the Declaration of 
Independence, proclaimed the importance of liberty, the value of human 
dignity, and the need for a new form of government dedicated to the will 
of the people. As heirs to that legacy and the fortunate citizens of a 
democratic Nation, we continue to cherish the values of freedom and 
equality. Many people across the globe, however, are still denied the 
rights we exercise daily and too often take for granted. During Captive 
Nations Week, we reaffirm our solidarity with those around the world who 
suffer under the shadow of dictators and tyrants.
Americans have expressed their devotion to freedom and human rights 
through actions as well as words, having fought and died for these 
ideals time and again. In World War II, we battled the brutality of 
fascism. In Korea, Vietnam, and throughout the Cold War, we stood up to 
the despotism of communism. In the Persian Gulf, and in partnership with 
our NATO allies in the skies over Serbia and Kosovo, we have fought 
brutal and oppressive regimes.
Thanks to our strength and resolve and the courage of countless men and 
women in countries around the world, we can be proud that the list of 
captive nations has grown smaller. The fall of the Berlin Wall a decade 
ago finally enabled us to pursue democratic reform in Central and 
Eastern Europe and to lay the firm foundations of freedom, peace, and 
prosperity. And in countries around the world, from South Africa to 
South Korea to South America, democracy is flourishing, and citizens 
enjoy the liberty to seek their own destiny.
The post-Cold War world, however, confronts us with a new set of dangers 
to freedom--threats such as civil wars, terrorism, and ethnic cleansing. 
There are still rulers in the world who refuse to join the march toward 
freedom, who believe that the only way to govern is with an iron fist, 
and who rely on reprehensible practices like arbitrary detention, forced 
labor, torture, and execution to subjugate their people.
As we observe this Captive Nations Week, let us once again reaffirm our 
profound commitment to freedom and universal human rights. Let us 
continue to promote tolerance, justice, and equality and to speak out 
for those who have no voice. Let us rededicate ourselves to the growth 
of democracy and the rule of law; and let us resolve that in the next 
century we will foster the further expansion of the rights and freedoms 
with which Americans have been blessed for so long.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), 
has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation 
designating the third week in July of each year as ``Captive Nations 
Week.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 18 through July 24, 1999, as Captive 
Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to ob

[[Page 76]]

serve this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to 
rededicate ourselves to supporting the cause of freedom, human rights, 
and self-determination for all the peoples of the world.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7210 of July 22, 1999

Imposition of Restraints on Imports of Certain Steel Products From the 
Russian Federation

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. Article XI of the June 1, 1990, Agreement between the United States 
of America and the Russian Federation on Trade Relations (``the 1990 
Agreement''), which was entered into pursuant to title IV of the Trade 
Act of 1974, as amended (``the Trade Act''), provides that the Parties 
will consult with a view toward finding means of preventing market 
disruption, and authorizes the Parties to take action, including the 
imposition of import restrictions, to achieve this goal.
2. The Government of the United States and the Government of the Russian 
Federation (``Russia'') have mutually agreed that the conditions of 
Article XI of the 1990 Agreement have been met with respect to U.S. 
imports of certain steel products from Russia described in the Annex to 
this proclamation. Further, the Governments have concluded an Agreement 
Concerning Trade in Certain Steel Products from the Russian Federation 
(``the 1999 Agreement'') on remedial and preventative measures to 
address market conditions with respect to such products.
3. Section 125(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2135(c)) provides that 
whenever the United States, acting in pursuance of any of its rights or 
obligations under any trade agreement entered into pursuant to the Trade 
Act, withdraws, suspends, or modifies any obligation with respect to the 
trade of any foreign country or instrumentality, the President is 
authorized to proclaim increased duties or other import restrictions, to 
the extent, at such times, and for such periods as he deems necessary or 
appropriate, in order to exercise the rights or fulfill the obligations 
of the United States.
4. In pursuance of its rights under the 1990 Agreement, the United 
States Government is withdrawing, suspending, or modifying its 
obligations under Article I of the 1990 Agreement with respect to the 
certain steel products described in the Annex to this proclamation by 
establishing import restrictions to address market conditions with 
respect to these products.
5. I have determined that, effective immediately and continuing so long 
as the 1999 Agreement remains in effect, it is appropriate to proclaim 
import restrictions as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation in 
order to exer

[[Page 77]]

cise the rights and fulfill the obligations of the United States under 
the 1990 Agreement.
6. Section 125(f) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2135(f)) requires the 
President to provide an opportunity for interested parties to present 
views at a public hearing prior to taking action pursuant to section 
125(b), (c), or (d) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2135(b), (c), or (d)). 
Interested parties presented their views at a hearing held on March 2, 
1999.
7. Section 301 of title 3, United States Code, authorizes the President 
to delegate his authority to the head of any department or agency in the 
executive branch to perform without approval, ratification, or other 
action by the President any function that is vested in the President by 
law.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 
125(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2135(c)) and section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, do proclaim that:
    (1) Pursuant to U.S. rights under the 1990 Agreement and to 
implement and enforce the 1999 Agreement, imports of certain steel 
products from Russia are restricted as provided in the Annex to this 
proclamation.
    (2) The Secretary of Commerce (``the Secretary'') is authorized to 
exercise my authority to administer the import restrictions on certain 
steel products consistent with the 1999 Agreement as proclaimed herein. 
The Secretary shall provide instructions and any necessary interpretive 
guidance to the Commissioner, U.S. Customs Service, concerning the 
import restrictions set forth in this proclamation.
    (3) Such restrictions shall be effective with respect to articles 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the 
date set forth in the Annex and shall remain in effect during the period 
of the 1999 Agreement.
    (4) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7211 of July 23, 1999

Parents' Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Parents are the foundation of the family and a cornerstone of community 
life in America. They instill the values, attitudes, and guidance 
children need to become strong individuals and caring citizens; we turn 
to our parents for the unconditional love and encouragement we need to 
make the most of our lives and to contribute to the life of our Nation. 
On Parents' Day, we pay tribute to the millions of parents whose care 
has nurtured us, whose vigilance has protected us, and whose selfless 
devotion has blessed our lives.
The challenges of parenthood have changed as our society has changed. In 
many American families, both parents work outside the home and struggle 
to balance the competing demands of job, home, and family. In others, a 
single parent bears these responsibilities.
My Administration continues to support parents through initiatives such 
as the Children's Health Insurance Program and Head Start and by 
advocating child care, adoption, and child welfare expansion. We have 
worked hard to help parents support their families financially by 
creating new jobs, raising the minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income 
Tax Credit, preserving the national guarantee of health care for poor 
children, and increasing child support collections to record heights. We 
have helped parents balance work and family by enacting the Family and 
Medical Leave Act and releasing funds for after-school grants so that 
parents do not have to choose between keeping their jobs and ensuring 
that their children receive quality care and supervision.
Though helping parents do their job has always been a top priority of my 
Administration, we recognize that government programs alone cannot solve 
all the problems that families face today. For example, I am heartened 
by the passionate commitment of parents across America in response to 
our call for a national campaign to prevent youth violence. This 
campaign will ask all sectors of society to focus on this crucial issue, 
to discover what measures work, and to share that knowledge with other 
families in communities across our country.
There is no single cause or solution to ending the violence that has cut 
short too many young lives. But, by working together, we can change the 
values of our culture and influence the marketing strategies of media 
industries so that our children are not continually exposed to violent 
or other inappropriate materials in the games they play, the programs 
and movies they watch, or the music they hear. We also must continue our 
efforts to ensure that our young people do not gain unauthorized access 
to guns. Parents play a crucial role in all of these endeavors by 
remaining involved in the lives of their sons and daughters.
The First Lady and I have issued a challenge to our Nation to celebrate 
the coming of the new millennium by honoring the past and imagining the 
future. As we prepare to enter the 21st century, let us remember that, 
just as parents remain a treasured link to our past, they also influence 
the fu

[[Page 87]]

ture by raising their children to become the responsible citizens of 
tomorrow. On this day and throughout the year, let us honor the millions 
of devoted mothers and fathers who have fulfilled this solemn 
responsibility with extraordinary compassion, generosity, and love.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States and consistent with Public Law 103-362, do 
hereby proclaim Sunday, July 25, 1999, as Parents' Day. I invite the 
States, communities, and the people of the United States to join 
together in observing this day with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities to honor our Nation's parents.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7212 of July 26, 1999

25th Anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Bill of Rights guarantees that no American shall be ``deprived of 
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.'' This promise 
lies at the heart of our free society and reflects our reverence for 
impartial justice and the rule of law. In a few simple words, it cements 
the fundamental covenant between our government and the people it 
serves.
Our Nation's founders understood that true justice cannot exist unless 
it is accessible to all. In this same spirit, Congress established the 
Legal Services Corporation (LSC) 25 years ago to secure equal access to 
justice under the law for all Americans by making available high-quality 
legal assistance in civil matters to citizens who otherwise would be 
unable to afford it.
Designed as a private, nonprofit, independent entity, the LSC focuses 
its efforts on funding local legal services programs that are rooted in 
and accountable to the communities they serve. The dedicated staffs of 
these programs, and the many private attorneys who donate their time and 
expertise, strive to protect and defend the interests of their clients 
and to maintain the highest standards of the legal profession. In recent 
years, the LSC has provided grants to legal services programs serving 
every county in our Nation, as well as the U.S. territories. Each year, 
almost 60 thousand private attorneys participate by performing pro bono 
legal services, and almost 2 million people benefit from LSC-funded 
efforts.
The extraordinary success of the LSC highlights the importance of the 
legal profession's long-standing tradition of community service. It also 
reminds us of how much our society has been strengthened by the 
conscience and conviction of lawyers standing up for what is right. As 
part of my Call to Action to the American Legal Community, I hope to 
build on this tradition

[[Page 88]]

of service by challenging all attorneys across our Nation to donate some 
of their time and apply their skills to help those among us who cannot 
afford to pay for the representation they need.
As we mark the 25th Anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation, I 
salute the dedicated members of the Board of Directors, attorneys, 
paralegals, support staff, and volunteers associated with the LSC who 
have worked with talent, generosity, and determination to uphold 
America's fundamental commitment to justice for all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 25, 1999, as the 25th 
Anniversary of the Legal Services Corporation. I urge all Americans to 
join me in recognizing the contributions that the Legal Services 
Corporation, and the local programs that it supports, have made in 
fulfilling the promise of equal justice under the law.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7213 of July 26, 1999

National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In 1950, North Korea invaded its free neighbor to the south, raising the 
specter of armed communist expansion as a threat to democracies around 
the world. During the next 3 years of bitter struggle, more than 54,000 
Americans gave their lives for the cause of freedom. With the signing of 
a negotiated armistice in 1953, the Korean War became for a time the 
``Forgotten War.'' But each year on National Korean War Veterans 
Armistice Day, we pledge never to forget the lessons of that savage and 
costly conflict nor the members of our Armed Forces who risked their 
lives to defend democracy, human dignity, and the right to self-
determination.
The Korean War taught us that we have many allies in our ongoing crusade 
for human freedom and democratic rule. Under the auspices of the United 
Nations, 22 countries joined the United States and South Korea in 
resisting communist aggression by sending troops and providing medical 
support. Etched in stone on the Korean War Veterans Memorial in our 
Nation's capital, the names of these countries remind us that free 
nations everywhere share a profound responsibility to assist those who 
seek to defend themselves from the aggression of brutal and oppressive 
regimes. The Korean War also taught us the importance of vigilance in 
recognizing threats to freedom and the need for vigorous and decisive 
action in resisting such encroachments. Though the dark shroud of the 
Cold War has lifted from our world, new regional and ethnic conflicts 
remain a threat to international

[[Page 89]]

peace and human rights. Whether in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, or elsewhere, 
we will continue to defend the same eternal values for which so many 
courageous Americans fought in Korea.
The Congress, by Public Law 104-19 (36 U.S.C. 127), has designated July 
27, 1999, as ``National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day'' and has 
authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in 
observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim July 27, 1999, as National Korean War 
Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor and give thanks to 
our distinguished Korean War veterans. I also ask Federal departments 
and agencies and interested groups, organizations, and individuals to 
fly the flag of the United States at half-staff on July 27, 1999, in 
memory of the Americans who died as a result of their service in Korea.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7214 of July 30, 1999

To Provide for the Efficient and Fair Administration of
Action Taken With Regard to Imports of Lamb Meat and for Other Purposes

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On July 7, 1999, I issued Proclamation 7208, which implemented action 
of a type described in section 203(a)(3) of the Trade Act of 1974, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(3)) (the ``Trade Act''), with respect to 
imports of fresh, chilled, or frozen lamb meat, provided for in 
subheadings 0204.10.00, 0204.22.20, 0204.23.20, 0204.30.00, 0204.42.20, 
and 0204.43.20 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(HTS). Proclamation 7208 took effect on July 22, 1999.
2. Proclamation 7208 established import relief in the form of tariff-
rate quotas (TRQs) and increased duties but did not make specific 
provision for their administration. I have determined under section 
203(g)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(g)(1)) that it is necessary 
for the efficient and fair administration of the action undertaken in 
Proclamation 7208 to exempt from the measure goods that were exported 
prior to July 22, 1999.
3. I have further determined under section 203(g)(1) of the Trade Act 
that in order to provide for the efficient and fair administration of 
the TRQs established in Proclamation 7208 it is necessary to delegate my 
authority to administer the TRQs under that section to the United States 
Trade Representative.

[[Page 90]]

4. On May 28, 1999, I issued Proclamation 7202, which took certain 
actions to eliminate circumvention of the quantitative limitations 
applicable to imports of wheat gluten that were proclaimed in 
Proclamation 7103. I have determined that a technical correction in the 
description of an action taken in Proclamation 7202 is appropriate.
5. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the 
President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions 
of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions 
thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or 
imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
sections 203 and 604 of the Trade Act, and section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, do proclaim that:
(1) In order to provide for the efficient and fair administration of the 
TRQs on imports of fresh, chilled, or frozen lamb meat classified in HTS 
subheadings 0204.10.00, 0204.22.20, 0204.23.20, 0204.30.00, 0204.42.20, 
and 0204.43.20, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as 
provided for in the Annex to this proclamation.
(2) The United States Trade Representative is authorized to exercise my 
authority pursuant to section 203(g) of the Trade Act to take all action 
necessary, including the promulgation of regulations, to administer the 
TRQs relating to imports of lamb meat provided for in HTS subheadings 
0204.10.00, 0204.22.20, 0204.23.20, 0204.30.00, 0204.42.20, and 
0204.43.20.
(3) The third sentence of initial paragraph 4 of Proclamation 7202 is 
hereby stricken and the following sentence is inserted in lieu thereof: 
``Such action shall take the form of a reduction in the European 
Community's 1999/2000 wheat gluten quota allotment in the amount of 
5,402,000 kg., which represents the amount of wheat gluten that entered 
the United States in excess of the European Community's 1998 quota 
allocation.''
(4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders that 
are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
(5) The actions taken in this proclamation shall be effective on the 
date of signature of this proclamation and shall continue in effect 
through the close of the dates on which actions proclaimed in 
Proclamation 7202 and Proclamation 7208 cease to be effective, unless 
such actions are earlier expressly modified or terminated.
(6) The modifications to the HTS shall be effective with respect to 
goods exported on or after July 22, 1999, and shall continue in effect 
as provided in the Annex to this proclamation, unless such actions are 
earlier expressly modified or terminated.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the

Proclamation 7215 of August 24, 1999

Women's Equality Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The theme for America's celebration of the coming millennium is ``honor 
the past--imagine the future,'' a theme that could also describe our 
annual observance of Women's Equality Day. On this special day, we honor 
the past by remembering the decades-long struggle of visionary and 
determined women and men who fought for women's suffrage. Seventy-nine 
years ago, their efforts were rewarded with the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment to the Constitution, which guaranteed women the right to vote 
and moved our Nation forward on the path toward equal civil and 
political rights for all Americans.
This year we also mark the 35th anniversary of another hard-fought 
victory for women's equality: the enactment of Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, which--among other things--prohibits employment 
discrimination on the basis of gender. Title VII guarantees women equal 
access to jobs, promotions, pay, and benefits, empowering them to 
provide for themselves and their families and to achieve their highest 
aspirations. This historic legislation benefits our entire Nation by 
strengthening America's workforce and economy through the contributions 
of millions of Americans whose talents in the past had too often been 
ignored or excluded.
We also celebrate Women's Equality Day by imagining the future--a future 
where women will receive equal pay for equal work, where our social 
structures will help women and men to balance better the 
responsibilities of job and family, where there will be no ceilings to 
prevent women from rising as far and as fast as their talents will take 
them. Such a future seems possible when we reflect on the extraordinary 
feats women have achieved this summer alone. The entire world was 
captivated by the energy, skill, teamwork, and determination of the 
women soccer players from around the globe who competed in the Women's 
World Cup; and all America rejoiced when the U.S. team won a 
breathtaking victory. Just 13 days later, Air Force Colonel Eileen 
Collins, commander of Space Shuttle Mission STS-93, became the first 
woman to command a mission in space.
With a rich past, an exciting present, and a future of limitless 
possibilities, women have much to celebrate on this Women's Equality 
Day, and all Americans have much to be grateful for as we reflect on the 
countless contributions women make to the quality of our lives and the 
well-being of our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 1999, as 
Women's Equality Day. I call upon the citizens of our great Nation to 
observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine,

[[Page 94]]

and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7216 of August 25, 1999

Minority Enterprise Development Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout our history, America's minority entrepreneurs have 
contributed to the strength of our economy and the quality of our 
national life. In the 18th and 19th centuries, as farmers and fur 
traders, shipwrights and sea captains, barbers and bankers, they forged 
better lives for themselves, their families, and their neighbors. Often 
facing prejudice and discrimination, they nonetheless succeeded in 
creating businesses that energized their communities and helped to build 
a dynamic new society.
Today, minority business owners are branching out from predominantly 
retail and service industries into the fields of manufacturing, 
transportation, construction, energy, and technology, helping to power 
the longest peacetime economic expansion in our Nation's history. 
Producing goods and services that generate new jobs and spur investment, 
minority business owners have played a vital role in building an economy 
with nearly 19 million new jobs, wages rising at twice the rate of 
inflation, and the lowest peacetime unemployment rate since 1957.
All Americans can be proud that we have eliminated many of the obstacles 
that in the past hindered minority entrepreneurs from contributing the 
full value of their talents to our society. However, while many minority 
business owners are enjoying success, many still face barriers that keep 
them from competing on a level playing field. We must continue to build 
on the combined efforts of the private sector and government to ensure 
that minority-owned businesses have access to the capital, customers, 
and services that will enable them to succeed in high technology and 
other rapidly growing sectors.
Through my Administration's New Markets Initiative, we are building 
partnerships between business and government to encourage investments in 
areas that have not attracted investments in the past: inner cities, 
rural regions, and Indian reservations. We are striving to ensure that 
our Nation's economic expansion--which has benefited millions of 
Americans--will reach people who have been left behind for decades.
We are also working to help minority-owned firms harness the enormous 
power of the Internet. The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) 
at the Department of Commerce, together with the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), provide minority-owned businesses with the tools 
they need to succeed in the Information Age. These efforts range from 
interactive educational courses on the fundamentals of E-commerce to the 
creation of Phoenix-Opportunity, an automatic electronic bid-matching 
system that notifies firms of opportunities through the Internet. 
Similarly, SBA's Pro-Net

[[Page 95]]

system provides contracting officers and small and minority-owned 
businesses with an electronic gateway to procurement opportunities and 
information.
During Minority Enterprise Development Week, as we honor the many 
minority businessmen and women whose energy, spirit, and creativity have 
strengthened our economy and enriched our country, let us rededicate 
ourselves to nurturing the dreams and talents of all Americans and to 
realizing the limitless possibilities of our free enterprise system.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through 
September 25, 1999, as Minority Enterprise Development Week, and I call 
on all Americans to join together with minority business entrepreneurs 
across the country in appropriate observances.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7217 of August 25, 1999

Small Manufacturing Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's free enterprise system is continually energized by the skill, 
vision, and exceptional performance of our Nation's small 
manufacturers--those who employ fewer than 500 employees. Though small 
in size, these companies make enormous contributions to our economy and 
provide our society and the world with high-quality manufactured goods. 
More important, small manufacturers are a vital source of new jobs--
almost 1 million between 1992 and 1996--and provide a livelihood for 
nearly 12 million Americans.
We live in an age dominated by information and technology, where the 
global marketplace grows ever more complex and interdependent. As large 
manufacturers expand their reliance on smaller firms for parts and 
services, the performance of small manufacturers becomes increasingly 
important to the competitiveness of America's manufacturing sector.
My Administration, working with the Congress and State governments, has 
strived to ensure that these small firms have access to the resources, 
technology, expertise, and training they need to realize their highest 
potential. By passing two consecutive balanced budgets and signing into 
law the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we have helped to reduce interest 
rates, ease the tax burden on small firms, and encourage investment and 
growth. The Small Business Administration, through its vigorous lending 
and loan guaranty efforts, has improved access to capital so that small 
manufacturing

[[Page 96]]

firms and other small businesses can modernize, expand, and invest in 
worker training.
The Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) of the Department of 
Commerce, which is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, gives 
small manufacturers a solid foundation on which to build innovative 
ideas and products. With a network of more than 70 nonprofit centers, 
the MEP serves small manufacturers in all 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, and Puerto Rico, providing access to the newest technology, 
manufacturing processes, and business practices. The MEP's local centers 
offer personalized guidance to manufacturers on issues ranging from 
business to technology solutions. And because these centers are linked 
together through the Department of Commerce's National Institute of 
Standards and Technology, even the smallest manufacturing firms can 
enjoy instant access to the most advanced national resources.
Most important, we are continuing to invest in education and training to 
give America's working men and women the skills and knowledge they need 
to succeed in the jobs of the 21st century. The Workforce Investment Act 
of 1998, which I was pleased to sign into law last year, provides skill 
grants directly to workers so they can choose the kind of training they 
want and where they want to obtain it.
As we observe Small Manufacturing Week, let us pay tribute to America's 
more than 385,000 small manufacturing firms whose commitment to hard 
work and excellence has helped set our country on a steady course for 
continued growth and prosperity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through 
September 25, 1999, as Small Manufacturing Week, 1999. I invite all 
Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, 
and programs that recognize the achievements of our Nation's small 
manufacturers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of 
August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of 
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7218 of August 27, 1999

America Goes Back to School, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Education has always been at the heart of opportunity in America. It 
opens doors for our young people, gives them the tools they need to 
succeed, and instills in them a sense of responsibility as they strive 
to make the most of their lives. However, while the importance of 
education is unchanging, the challenges facing America's schools and 
students are not. There are

[[Page 97]]

now more children, from more diverse backgrounds, in our public schools 
than at any time in our country's history. We must ensure that their 
education gives them the knowledge and skills they need to help our 
Nation thrive in the new century.
America's current prosperity offers us an unprecedented opportunity to 
invest in our children's education. I am proud that we have begun that 
task by opening the doors of college to all our young people with tax 
credits and more affordable student loans, more Pell grants and work-
study jobs, education IRAs, and the new HOPE Scholarship tax cut that 
more than 5 million Americans will have received by the end of this 
year. I have also announced $43 million in grants to help States and 
communities to recruit talented people into teaching jobs and improve 
the quality of teaching nationwide.
These are important accomplishments, but we must build on them. The goal 
of the America Goes Back to School initiative is to support family and 
community involvement in childhood learning and to build strong 
community support for our schools, teachers, and students.
This year's theme--``Challenge Our Students and They Will Soar''--
reflects our faith in America's youth and our commitment to providing 
them with the tools they need to succeed in our rapidly changing world. 
We must turn around failing schools, hold States and school districts 
accountable for helping all children reach high academic standards, 
support charter schools and other forms of public school choice, expand 
after-school and summer programs, develop pathways to college and 
careers, and provide safe, drug-free schools for all our children. We 
must ensure that all our students have access to computers and that 
every classroom and library is connected to the Internet. If we want our 
children to compete at a world-class level, they must have modern, 
world-class schools. I am therefore challenging the Congress to enact my 
proposals to build and modernize 6,000 public schools; and I am also 
asking the Congress to continue funding to hire 100,000 well-prepared 
teachers to reduce class size in the early grades, the years that we 
know--intuitively and through research--are critical to the development 
of children's learning and thinking skills.
My Administration is working hard to improve our Nation's education 
system, but no government effort can replace the vision, encouragement, 
and dedication of our families and communities. As America's students go 
back to school this year, let us pledge to provide every child with a 
safe and supportive environment in which to learn and grow, and let us 
ensure that every segment of our society is involved in the effort. Let 
us also resolve that our young people will return to schools that are 
genuine places of learning, where they receive the care, attention, and 
education they need to reach their full potential.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 29 through 
September 11, 1999, as a time when America Goes Back to School. I 
encourage parents, schools, community and State leaders, businesses, 
civic and religious organizations, and the people of the United States 
to observe this period with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
expressing support for high academic standards and promoting family and 
community involvement in providing a quality education for every child.

of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

Proclamation 7219 of September 2, 1999

Contiguous Zone of the United States

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

International law recognizes that coastal nations may establish zones 
contiguous to their territorial seas, known as contiguous zones.
The contiguous zone of the United States is a zone contiguous to the 
territorial sea of the United States, in which the United States may 
exercise the control necessary to prevent infringement of its customs, 
fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations within its 
territory or territorial sea, and to punish infringement of the above 
laws and regulations committed within its territory or territorial sea.
Extension of the contiguous zone of the United States to the limits 
permitted by international law will advance the law enforcement and 
public health interests of the United States. Moreover, this extension 
is an important step in preventing the removal of cultural heritage 
found within 24 nautical miles of the baseline.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, by the authority vested in me as 
President by the Constitution of the United States, and in accordance 
with international law, do hereby proclaim the extension of the 
contiguous zone of the United States of America, including the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States 
Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and 
any other territory or possession over which the United States exercises 
sovereignty, as follows:
The contiguous zone of the United States extends to 24 nautical miles 
from the baselines of the United States determined in accordance with 
international law, but in no case within the territorial sea of another

Proclamation 7220 of September 14, 1999

National Hispanic Heritage Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we reflect on the history of a 
people who were part of this land long before the birth of the United 
States. Hispanics were among the earliest European settlers in the New 
World, and Hispanics as a people--like their many cultures--share a rich 
history and great diversity. Hispanic Americans have roots in Europe, 
Africa, and South and Central America and close cultural ties to Mexico, 
the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and Spain. This diversity 
has brought variety and richness to the mosaic that is America and has 
strengthened our national character with invaluable perspective, 
experiences, and values.
Through the years, Hispanic Americans have played an integral role in 
our Nation's success in science, the arts, business, government, and 
every other field of endeavor, and their talent, creativity, and 
achievements continue to energize our national life. For example, 
Hispanic Americans serve as NASA astronauts, including Dr. Ellen Ochoa, 
the first Hispanic woman in space. Mario Molina of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology shared a Nobel Prize in chemistry for research 
that raised awareness of the threat that chlorofluorocarbons pose to the 
earth's protective ozone layer. Cuban-American writer Oscar Hijuelos 
earned a Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
The achievements of today's Hispanic Americans build upon a long 
tradition of contributions by Hispanics in many varied fields. Before 
Dr. Ochoa and other Hispanic Americans began to explore the frontiers of 
space, Hernando de Soto and Francisco Vasquez de Coronado ventured into 
the vast uncharted land of the New World. A thousand years before Mario 
Molina calculated the effects of human actions on the atmosphere, Mayan 
priests accurately predicted solar and lunar eclipses. And before Oscar 
Hijuelos described a Cuban family's emigration to 1940s America, Miguel 
de Cervantes Saavedra gave us the classic adventures of Don Quixote and 
Sancho Panza.

[[Page 100]]

Today, people of Hispanic heritage are an increasingly important and 
growing segment of our Nation's population. Studies show that, in just a 
few years, Hispanics will form the largest minority group in the United 
States. In little more than a decade, Hispanic Americans will wield 
buying power of nearly $1 trillion per year. And by the middle of the 
next century, if population trends continue, almost one-fourth of our 
population will be Spanish-speaking. The success of these citizens is 
vital to our continued national prosperity, and we must ensure that they 
are empowered with the tools and opportunities they need to thrive in 
the next century.
That is why my Administration has worked to widen the circle of economic 
opportunity, enforce our civil rights laws, invest in health and 
education, and promote racial reconciliation. We have launched a major 
initiative to mobilize the resources and expertise of the Federal 
Government, the private sector, and local communities to end racial and 
ethnic disparities in health conditions and health care. We established 
the first-ever Office of Minority Health Research and Alternative 
Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. We also have sought to 
expand our Hispanic Education Action Plan with an additional $480 
million for improving educational programs and institutions serving high 
concentrations of Hispanic students. We cannot seize the enormous 
opportunities of the 21st century if a large percentage of our children 
lack the skills and knowledge they need to reach their full potential.
In honor of the many contributions that Hispanic Americans have made and 
continue to make to our Nation and our culture, the Congress, by Public 
Law 100-402, has authorized and requested the President to issue 
annually a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as 
``National Hispanic Heritage Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 1999, as 
National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon government officials, 
educators, and the people of the United States to honor this observance 
with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs, and I encourage 
all Americans to rededicate themselves to the pursuit of equality.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7221 of September 15, 1999

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As we look back over this century that is swiftly drawing to a close, we 
recognize that the light of freedom still burns brightly in our world 
today because of the service and sacrifice of America's men and women in 
uni

[[Page 101]]

form. Through the devastation of two world wars and the brutality of 
numerous regional conflicts; on peacekeeping assignments and 
humanitarian missions; from the darkest days of the Cold War to the fall 
of the Berlin Wall, our Nation's service men and women have fought the 
forces of tyranny and won signal victories for liberty, human dignity, 
and the ideals of democracy. On every continent, on the seas, and in the 
air, gallant young Americans have paid for our future with their own, 
and many have preserved our freedom by sacrificing their own.
On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we remember with profound gratitude 
those who suffered captivity and those whose fate remains unknown. Many 
American POWs were tortured at the hands of their captors; all 
experienced the ordeal of being held against their will and the anguish 
of indefinite separation from their families and their homeland.
Today we also honor the valiant families of our fellow citizens who 
remain missing--families who have had to suffer not only the absence of 
their loved ones, but also the uncertainty of their fate. As Americans, 
we remain unshakable in our resolve to achieve the fullest possible 
accounting of those missing and to strive to bring home the remains of 
those who have died. Only by doing so can we begin to acknowledge the 
debt we owe to these patriots and assuage the grief of the families they 
left behind for the sake of our Nation.
On September 17, 1999, the flag of the National League of Families of 
American Prisoners of War and Missing in Southeast Asia, a black and 
white banner symbolizing America's missing and our unwavering 
determination to account for them, will be flown over the White House, 
the U.S. Capitol, the Departments of State, Defense, and Veterans 
Affairs, the Selective Service System Headquarters, the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, national cemeteries, and 
other locations across our country.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, by virtue of the authority vested 
in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby 
proclaim September 17, 1999, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I ask 
all Americans to join me in honoring former American prisoners of war 
and those whose fate is still undetermined. I also encourage the 
American people to remember with compassion and concern the courageous 
families who persevere in their quest to know the fate of their missing 
loved ones. Finally, I urge Federal, State, and local officials and 
private organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, 
programs, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7222 of September 16, 1999

Citizenship Day and Constitution Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The Constitution is perhaps our Nation's most cherished document, the 
compass that has helped us chart America's course toward freedom, human 
dignity, and democracy for more than 200 years. Its text, born of the 
genius and idealism of our Founders and hammered out through hard effort 
and compromise by the delegates to the Constitutional Convention, 
established a system of government capable of responding to the 
pressures of social and political change. It created a sacred covenant 
that continues to bind all our citizens by a set of principles based on 
the ideals of equality, inclusion, and independence and by a delicate 
balance of powers, rights, and responsibilities among citizens and their 
State and Federal Governments. Today, sustained by the efforts and 
sacrifices of generations of Americans, the U.S. Constitution remains as 
strong and vibrant a charter of freedom as it was at the time of its 
signing 212 years ago.
The 20th century has witnessed a great wave of migration of men and 
women to our Nation from all parts of the globe, attracted by the 
freedom, justice, and rule of law guaranteed by our Constitution. As 
they assume the responsibilities of American citizenship, they infuse 
our political process with fresh perspectives and enthusiasm and prove 
to the world that a diverse people can live in peace and progress. Today 
we are a Nation with new hopes, new dreams, and new people, but we are 
united by a devotion to the same democratic ideals that have guided us 
for over 200 years.
As we reflect upon America's past, we recognize that our country is 
still in the act of becoming the ``more perfect union'' envisioned by 
our Founders. Every generation of Americans has struggled to live up to 
our Nation's promise, working to overcome forces of fear or ignorance or 
prejudice that would seek to deny the rights of others because of their 
gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or disability. The 21st 
century may bring new challenges to the rights and liberties of American 
citizens, but we can be confident that the Constitution will still light 
a clear and shining path of freedom and justice into the future.
During Citizenship Day and Constitution Week, let us recognize the great 
efforts not only of our leaders, but also of ordinary Americans who 
labor daily to uphold and strengthen the ideals embodied in our 
Constitution. Whether citizens by birth or choice, we share the 
blessings guaranteed to us by the Constitution and the responsibility of 
ensuring that those blessings are extended to all our people equally.
In commemoration of the signing of the Constitution and in recognition 
of the importance of active, responsible citizenship in preserving the 
Constitution's blessings for our Nation, the Congress, by joint 
resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 153), designated September 17 
as ``Citizenship Day,'' and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 
(U.S.C. 159), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning 
September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution 
Week.''

[[Page 103]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 1999, as Citizenship Day and 
September 17 through September 23, 1999, as Constitution Week. I call 
upon Federal, State, and local officials, as well as leaders of civic, 
educational, and religious organizations, to conduct meaningful 
ceremonies and programs in our schools, houses of worship, and other 
community centers to foster a greater understanding and appreciation of 
the Constitution and the rights and duties of citizenship. I also call 
on all citizens to rededicate themselves to the principles of the 
Constitution.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

<R05>
Proclamation 7223 of September 17, 1999

Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ovarian cancer is a devastating disease that takes the lives of 
thousands of women in our Nation each year. Since 1985, there has been a 
dramatic increase in the incidence of ovarian cancer, with a 30 percent 
increase in the number of women diagnosed with the disease and an 18 
percent increase in the number of fatalities. Ovarian cancer is 
particularly deadly, killing nearly 15,000 women each year. It is often 
not diagnosed until the cancer is in the late stages of development, 
limiting the effectiveness of treatment and reducing the chances of 
survival. In its late stages, the chances of survival from ovarian 
cancer are just 25 percent; when it is detected early, before the cancer 
spreads, the survival rate exceeds 90 percent.
Our most effective weapon in the battle against ovarian cancer is early 
detection. Subtle but recognizable symptoms, such as bloating, vague 
abdominal pain and discomfort, gastrointestinal problems, back pain, and 
fatigue can also be symptoms of other less serious illnesses, but women 
who are experiencing such early warning signs should consult their 
doctors immediately for appropriate tests.
Doctors and researchers have identified factors that put women at higher 
risk of developing ovarian cancer, including a family history of breast 
and ovarian cancer, a high fat diet, never having had children, or 
infertility. It is vital that women learn about risk factors and visit 
their doctors regularly.
As we observe Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week, let us build on our efforts 
to eradicate this serious disease and urge all American women and their 
families to learn more about ovarian cancer, its symptoms, and available 
methods that may reduce the risk of developing it. By increasing 
awareness of early warning signs and risk factors, maintaining a healthy 
diet, and consulting regularly with health care professionals, women 
across America can lead healthier and longer lives and help our Nation 
win the fight against ovarian cancer.

[[Page 104]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through 
September 25, 1999, as Ovarian Cancer Awareness Week. I encourage the 
American people to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

<R05>
Proclamation 7224 of September 17, 1999

National Farm Safety and Health Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

President Franklin Roosevelt once called America's farmers and ranchers 
``the source from which the reservoirs of our nation's strength are 
constantly renewed.'' It was during his Administration, in the critical 
years of World War II, that Americans began to realize that thousands of 
agricultural workers and their families suffered disabling and fatal 
injuries each year in their work of producing food for our Nation and 
the world. The tragic statistics were so troubling that President 
Roosevelt, with the encouragement of his Secretary of Agriculture and 
the President of the National Safety Council, signed the initial 
proclamation for National Farm Safety Week in 1944.
We have achieved substantial progress in the decades since that first 
proclamation. Farm equipment manufacturers have engineered safety 
features into their machinery that have decreased the likelihood of 
severe injuries among operators. Chemical manufacturers have 
reformulated pest control products to reduce the potential for poisoning 
incidents. Personal protective equipment is now available to protect 
farm and ranch workers. And safety and health professionals have made 
great strides in the development and implementation of educational 
initiatives that raise awareness among agricultural workers of measures 
and equipment they can use to reduce on-the-job injuries and health 
risks.
But we cannot afford to become complacent. Children continue to be the 
most vulnerable members of farming and ranching families. Those who work 
with livestock and around farm machinery should be carefully supervised 
and should be assigned chores that are commensurate with their level of 
awareness, knowledge, and ability to perform the job safely. Older 
Americans working in agriculture also are at risk; farmers and ranchers 
often work well past retirement age in a determined effort to maintain 
the farming heritage of their families and to continue contributing to 
the vocation they love. Many of these older men and women have suffered 
work-related hearing impairment over the years, and many also have 
limited mobility due to previous injuries or arthritis. Their families 
and coworkers should

[[Page 105]]

be vigilant in overseeing the activities of these older workers to help 
ensure their safety as they carry out their daily responsibilities.
America's farmers and ranchers are the backbone of our economy and the 
lifeblood of our land, and their skill, effort, and determination 
provide food and fiber for our country and the world. Our farming and 
ranching families stand for the values that have kept America strong for 
more than 220 years--hard work, faith and family, perseverance and 
patience. We all have a vital interest in their success, and we can all 
play an important role in ensuring their continued well-being. As we 
observe this year's theme of ``Protecting Agriculture in the Next 
Century,'' I urge all Americans to show their appreciation for the 
dedication and sacrifices of our Nation's farmers and ranchers by 
renewing our efforts to protect their safety and health. Together, we 
can ensure that the time-honored traditions of American farming and 
ranching will flourish in the new century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through 
September 25, 1999, as National Farm Safety and Health Week. I call upon 
government agencies, businesses, and professional associations that 
serve our agricultural sector to strengthen their efforts to promote 
safety and health programs among our Nation's farm and ranch workers. I 
ask agricultural workers to take advantage of the many diverse education 
and training programs and technical advancements that can help them 
avoid injury and illness. I also call upon our Nation to recognize 
Wednesday, September 22, 1999, as a day to focus on the risks facing 
young people on farms and ranches. Finally, I call upon the citizens of 
our Nation to reflect on the bounty we enjoy thanks to the labor and 
dedication of agricultural workers across our land.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7225 of September 17, 1999

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

America's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have 
provided a crucial avenue to educational and economic advancement for 
African American youth for more than 150 years. These institutions, 
dedicated to equality and excellence in higher education, have their 
roots in a segregated society; their survival in the face of limited 
financial resources or outside support stood as a beacon of hope for 
generations of African Americans.

[[Page 106]]

While our society has changed in the intervening decades, the need for 
these institutions has not. Our Nation's HBCUs have assisted African 
American and other students from low-income communities in achieving 
their educational goals and reaching their full potential, while keeping 
tuition costs affordable. The vast majority of African Americans with 
bachelor's degrees in engineering, computer science, life science, 
business, and mathematics have graduated from one of the 105 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities. According to the 
Department of Education's National Center for Educational Statistics, 
HBCUs conferred 28 percent of all bachelor's degrees awarded to African 
American graduates in 1996, although enrollment at HBCUs constituted 
only 16 percent of all African American college students.
In addition to giving students the knowledge and skills they need to 
succeed in today's challenging global economy, HBCUs also offer students 
leadership opportunities that build self-confidence, a nurturing 
learning and social environment, and networks of successful alumni who 
serve as positive role models and mentors for graduates. Cultural 
programs and educational outreach to minority- and low-income areas in 
our Nation help preserve African American heritage and make HBCUs a 
source of pride and knowledge for the communities they serve.
By serving the African American community, HBCUs serve all Americans. 
These institutions embody many of our most deeply cherished values--
equality, diversity, opportunity, and hard work. HBCUs prepare talented 
young men and women to succeed in every sector of our economy. And the 
alumni of HBCUs have contributed immeasurably to our Nation's success--
as scientists, businesspeople, educators, public servants, and so much 
more. As education and diversity become increasingly important in the 
21st century, graduates of HBCUs will continue to be at the vanguard of 
America's progress.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 19 through 25, 
1999, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I 
call upon the people of the United States, including government 
officials, educators, and administrators, to observe this week with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities honoring America's 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and their graduates.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7226 of September 24, 1999

Gold Star Mother's Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For generations, the brave men and women of our Armed Forces have 
answered our Nation's call to service. In the air, on the sea, and 
across the world's battlefields, they have fought with valor and 
determination so that we might continue to live in freedom. The 
blessings of liberty and peace we know today have been paid for with the 
lives of those who never returned home.
The Gold Star Mothers of America know the price of freedom all too well. 
They have experienced one of life's greatest joys in becoming a parent 
and have endured one of life's greatest sorrows in losing a son or 
daughter. The spirit of sacrifices made by our fallen warriors lives on 
in the hearts of our Gold Star Mothers.
Their sacrifice lives on as well in the work Gold Star Mothers perform 
in communities throughout our country, working with disabled veterans 
and their families, nurturing patriotism in a new generation of young 
Americans, reaching out to others who have lost a child in the service 
of our Nation, and ensuring that the contributions of their own sons and 
daughters are never forgotten. The generous and compassionate work of 
Gold Star Mothers is a powerful legacy of service that they carry on in 
loving memory of their children.
We have a profound obligation to honor the service and sacrifice of 
these remarkable women as we honor their children. That is why the 
Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 
1895), has designated the last Sunday in September as ``Gold Star 
Mother's Day'' and authorized and requested the President to issue a 
proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 26, 1999, as Gold Star Mother's 
Day. I call on all government officials to display the United States 
flag on government buildings on this day. I also urge the American 
people to display the flag and to hold appropriate meetings in their 
homes, places of worship, or other suitable places as a public 
expression of the sympathy and the respect that our Nation holds for its 
Gold Star Mothers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day 
of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7227 of September 29, 1999

100th Anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a free Nation, we must always remember that our achievements in peace 
have been built on the sacrifices of our veterans in war. We owe a 
profound debt to brave Americans like the members of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars of the United States who knew their duty and did it well--
even at the risk of their freedom and their lives, and we are proud to 
honor the VFW as it celebrates its 100th anniversary.
Each VFW member has given double service to our Nation by answering the 
call to duty in the Armed Forces and by joining the VFW. Whether raising 
the morale of our men and women in uniform, helping veterans receive 
their much-deserved benefits, providing scholarships for our youth, or 
bringing hope and help to families and communities in need, these 
veterans have upheld the highest standards of service and citizenship. 
Perhaps most important, they are the living reminder of the countless 
men and women who have served and sacrificed throughout past decades to 
defend our Nation and preserve the liberties we hold so dear. VFW 
members and their fallen comrades have carried the torch of freedom both 
at home and in distant lands, and America remains forever grateful.
We have a solemn responsibility to ensure that all our veterans enjoy 
the quality of life they deserve. On Veterans Day last year, I was proud 
to sign into law the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act. This legislation 
improves a wide range of benefits and programs, including an increase in 
compensation payments to veterans with disabilities as well as benefits 
to the survivors of Americans who died serving our country.
The small groups of Spanish-American War veterans who first banded 
together in 1899 could not have envisioned that their numbers would grow 
to more than two million strong, or that the VFW would come to have such 
an enormous positive influence on the lives of generations of veterans, 
their families, and communities throughout our Nation. As we celebrate 
the centennial of the VFW, we honor these veterans for all they have 
done to build a proud past for our Nation and to ensure a brighter 
future for us all.
Recognizing the contribution of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to the 
continued strength of our country and success of our democracy, the 
Congress, by H.J. Res. 34, has called on the President to issue a 
proclamation in observance of September 29, 1999, as the ``100th 
Anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.'' On this day, let us 
reflect with pride on our great country and remember with gratitude the 
contributions of the many loyal and courageous veterans who have given 
so much of themselves both at home and around the world to preserve our 
freedom.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim September 29, 1999, as the 100th Anniversary 
of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I urge all Americans to recognize this 
day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Proclamation 7228 of September 30, 1999

National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Across America today, women are living challenging, fulfilling lives, 
skillfully balancing the responsibilities of work, family, and 
community, and making plans for a bright future. But for thousands of 
these women each year, the diagnosis of breast cancer shatters the 
pattern of everyday existence. For millions more, the fear of such a 
diagnosis casts a shadow across their lives. This year alone, an 
estimated 175,000 new cases will be diagnosed, and more than 43,000 
women will die from breast cancer.
Despite these tragic statistics, we are beginning to see real progress 
in our national crusade against this disease. The breast cancer 
mortality rate in the United States has steadily declined over the past 
10 years, and currently 2 million American women are winning the battle 
against this cancer.
Our steadfast commitment to breast cancer research is finally bearing 
fruit and has led the way to new preventative treatments. Last year, the 
National Cancer Institute's (NCI) landmark Breast Cancer Prevention 
Trial revealed that there were 49 percent fewer reported diagnoses among 
women who took tamoxifen. In another promising effort, researchers are 
looking at an alternate drug to see if we can achieve the same results 
but with fewer side effects.
Researchers are also conducting studies to determine if other 
medications can provide an effective weapon in our war against breast 
cancer. The Food and Drug Administration has recently approved the use 
of a new drug that has proved to be effective in the treatment of 
patients already in the advanced stages of this disease. Studies 
indicate that the drug may benefit 25 to 30 percent of women with 
advanced breast cancer. Encouraged by these findings, the NCI has 
rapidly expanded its study to include earlier stages of breast cancer 
and the treatment of other cancers, such as ovarian cancer.
We have also made promising strides in promoting the early detection of 
breast cancer, which is critical to prolonging patients' lives. A recent 
survey conducted by the NCI and the Health Care Financing Administration 
(HCFA) showed that 88 percent of women 65 years of age and older had 
undergone at least one mammogram during their lifetime--a 25 percent 
increase from 1992. Of the women who had a mammogram, 80 percent 
received their most recent test within the past 2 years, and more than 
75 percent knew of Medicare's mammography coverage. The NCI and HCFA 
hope to build on this progress through their joint campaign to raise 
women's awareness of the importance of regularly scheduled mammograms 
and the availability of Medicare mammography benefits.

[[Page 110]]

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also played a 
vital role in combating breast cancer by providing access to screenings 
for medically underserved women. Authorized by the Breast and Cervical 
Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990, the CDC's early detection 
program provides breast and cervical cancer screening services for women 
who might otherwise not receive them, such as older women, women with 
lower incomes, and women of color. This program has provided nearly 1 
million mammograms, resulting in the diagnosis of more than 5,800 breast 
cancer cases.
Having lost my own mother to this devastating disease, I know all too 
well the pain and hardship that breast cancer inflicts on women and 
their families. I urge all Americans to join me in the crusade to 
prevent, treat, and ultimately eradicate breast cancer. By building on 
the breakthroughs we have achieved in research, prevention, and 
treatment and by promoting continued education and awareness, we can 
ensure that millions of women can look forward to longer lives and a 
brighter future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1999 as National 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, 
businesses, communities, health care professionals, educators, 
volunteers, and all the people of the United States to publicly reaffirm 
our Nation's strong and continuing commitment to controlling and curing 
breast cancer.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7229 of September 30, 1999

National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As Americans, we define ourselves in many ways--not only by our families 
and communities, but also by our work; not only by who we are, but also 
by what we do for a living. Millions of Americans with disabilities, 
however, do not share that experience because their path to the world of 
work has been strewn with barriers. At a time when the unemployment rate 
in our Nation is at the lowest level in a generation--4.2 percent--a 
staggering 75 percent of Americans with disabilities remain unemployed, 
even though the vast majority of them want to work.
One of the greatest barriers to employment for people with disabilities 
is that, under current law, they often become ineligible for Medicaid or 
Medicare if they work. That is why I have challenged the Congress to 
pass the bipartisan Work Incentives Improvement Act. This proposed 
legislation would extend Medicare coverage for people with disabilities 
who return to

[[Page 111]]

work and improve access to health care through Medicaid. No American 
should ever be forced to choose between health care coverage and 
employment, and this legislation will help ensure that no one has to 
make that choice.
In addition to fully funding the Work Incentives Improvement Act, my 
Administration's proposed budget includes a $1,000 tax credit to help 
people with disabilities offset the cost of special transportation and 
other work-related expenses. We are also seeking to double our 
investment in such assistive technology as braille translators, mobile 
phones, and voice recognition software that give disabled citizens the 
tools they need to make the transition to work. And in June of this 
year, I signed an Executive order to expand employment opportunities for 
people with psychiatric disabilities and set an example for the private 
sector by ensuring that the Federal Government's hiring and promotion 
standards are the same for these workers as they are for people with 
mental retardation or severe physical disabilities.
Next year our Nation will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act and the 25th anniversary of the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--the two landmark pieces of 
legislation that transformed our country's disability policy and set a 
standard for other nations around the world. However, putting an end to 
negative attitudes and shattering destructive stereotypes will require 
the concerted efforts of all sectors of society. Until we integrate 
Americans with disabilities as full participants in our social fabric, 
we will never reach our employment goals.
This year, in addition to rededicating ourselves to breaking down 
employment barriers, we will highlight the achievements of people with 
disabilities in areas such as journalism, entertainment, and the arts. 
People like journalist John Hockenberry prove that a wheelchair need not 
be an obstacle to traveling the world to report breaking news. Artists 
like blind sculptor Michael Naranjo and deaf painter Alex Wilhite 
illustrate that having a disability can be the vehicle for advancing the 
arts in novel ways. Performers like Laurie Rubin, a classically trained 
vocalist, show us that blindness need not prevent one from taking the 
great stage of the opera.
To recognize the enormous potential of individuals with disabilities and 
to encourage all Americans to work toward their full integration into 
the workforce, the Congress, by joint resolution approved August 11, 
1945, as amended (36 U.S.C. 121), has designated October of each year as 
``National Disability Employment Awareness Month.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 1999 as National Disability 
Employment Awareness Month. I call upon Government officials, educators, 
labor leaders, employers, and the people of the United States to observe 
this month with appropriate programs and activities that reaffirm our 
determination to fulfill both the letter and spirit of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7230 of September 30, 1999

National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Most families provide a nurturing web of relationships where children 
learn to love and respect others and themselves and absorb the values 
that will shape them as adults and citizens. But for millions of 
Americans, family life has become a battlefield where women, children, 
and sometimes the elderly become casualties. The tragedy of domestic 
violence touches all our lives by weakening families, leaving emotional 
scars as devastating as physical ones, and creating a destructive cycle 
of violence where those who were abused as children may become abusers 
themselves.
My Administration has taken important steps to reduce domestic violence 
by creating a system that punishes offenders and provides victims with 
the information and assistance they need to escape destructive family 
environments. The cornerstone of this effort has been the Violence 
Against Women Act (VAWA), which was part of the historic Crime Bill I 
signed into law in 1994. This landmark legislation combined tough new 
penalties for offenders with funding for much-needed shelters, 
counseling services, public education, and research to help the victims 
of violence.
We also have established a toll-free National Domestic Violence Hotline 
(1-800-799-SAFE) where staff responds to as many as 10,000 calls each 
month; worked to raise awareness in the workplace and among health care 
providers about domestic violence; and more than tripled resources for 
programs to combat violence against women. To build on the success of 
the VAWA and the Crime Bill, in May of this year I unveiled my proposal 
for additional legislation--the 21st Century Crime Bill--that will 
reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and toughen penalties for 
those who commit violent crimes in the presence of children.
We have increased funding for State maternal and child health programs 
that include child protection and family preservation services. We have 
worked with the Congress to pass legislation that strengthens law 
enforcement, enhances child predator tracking and protection mechanisms, 
and supports child abuse prevention efforts in State and local 
jurisdictions. And, at the end of last year, we launched the Children 
Exposed to Violence Initiative (CEVI), designed in part to reform 
Federal and State laws to provide swift and certain punishment for those 
who commit child abuse and neglect. CEVI will also strengthen local 
programs in hopes of reducing the number of children who are exposed to 
violence or become victims of violence themselves; it will also 
encourage alliances that include government as a partner with schools, 
communities, parents, and other family members in an effort to prevent 
child abuse.
We can take heart in our progress and at the outpouring of concern and 
compassion we see for the victims of domestic violence. Whether members 
of the law enforcement community, health care professionals, educators, 
religious and community leaders, policymakers, or concerned private 
citizens, Americans have united in the crusade against domestic 
violence. With increased awareness, strengthened prevention, and 
communities

[[Page 113]]

united in common cause, we are making the reduction of domestic violence 
a reality and the dream of ending it one day a possibility.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1999 as National 
Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call upon government officials, law 
enforcement agencies, health professionals, educators, community 
leaders, and the American people to join together to end the domestic 
violence that threatens so many of our people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7231 of October 1, 1999

Fire Prevention Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Of the many disasters that affect our communities in a given year, fire 
is one that Americans can actually prevent; and, through early warning 
and appropriate response, we can minimize the havoc fire wreaks when it 
does occur. In 1998, U.S. fire departments responded to nearly 1.8 
million fires, with three-quarters of them occurring in residences. Fire 
cost our Nation some $8.6 billion in property loss last year, and it 
took a staggering human toll: more than 4,000 civilians died, and 91 
firefighters lost their lives in the line of duty.
The place where Americans feel safest--at home--is the very place where 
we are at greatest risk from fire. Eighty percent of all U.S. fire 
deaths occur at home. If Americans knew more about fire prevention and 
better understood how to react quickly and sensibly when fire breaks 
out, we could greatly reduce such deaths.
Because knowledge of simple fire safety precautions is so vital to 
saving lives, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) launched a 
3-year initiative to teach the importance of planning and practicing how 
to escape from fire. In partnership with the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, through its United States Fire Administration, and 
our Nation's fire services, NFPA has again selected, ``Fire Drills: The 
Great Escape!'' as the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week.
Fire spreads quickly, making a fast response essential to survival. I 
urge every family to develop a home fire escape plan and to practice it 
at least twice a year. The elements of a good plan include installing 
working smoke alarms on every level of the home, establishing two ways 
out of each room, and establishing a meeting place outside the home.
Each of us can take these simple steps to plan and practice our own 
``great escape'' from fire and significantly improve our chance of 
survival if fire

[[Page 114]]

occurs. By doing so, we can pay fitting tribute to the selfless service 
of our Nation's firefighters. The extraordinary personal sacrifice made 
by firefighters throughout America, and the dedication of all men and 
women who serve in our Nation's fire services, will be honored on 
Sunday, October 10, 1999, at the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial 
Service in Emmitsburg, Maryland.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 3 through October 
9, 1999, as Fire Prevention Week. I encourage the people of the United 
States to take an active role in fire prevention not only during this 
week, but also throughout the year. I also call upon every citizen to 
pay tribute to the members of our fire and emergency services who have 
lost their lives or been injured in service to their communities, and to 
those men and women who carry on their noble tradition.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7232 of October 1, 1999

Child Health Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As America's children begin their exciting journey into the 21st 
century, one of the greatest gifts we can give them is a healthy start; 
and we should recognize that the well-being of our young people includes 
both their physical and mental health.
We have already made great strides in addressing children's physical 
health care needs through the Children's Health Insurance Program 
(CHIP), which funds State efforts to provide affordable health insurance 
to millions of uninsured children. Sadly, however, as many as one in ten 
American children and adolescents today may have behavioral or mental 
health problems; and parents, teachers, and health care professionals 
need to realize that even very young children can experience serious 
clinical depression. The majority of children who commit suicide are 
profoundly depressed, and the majority of parents whose children took 
their own lives did not recognize that depression until it was too late.
My Administration is working to increase children's access to mental 
health care and to help communities expand counseling, mentoring, and 
mental health services in our schools. In addition, we fought to ensure 
that funding for CHIP contains a strong mental health benefits 
component. While there is no substitute for parents becoming and 
remaining involved in their children's lives, we must give families the 
tools they need to meet the challenges they face.

[[Page 115]]

Perhaps the most vital step we can take to ensure that every child 
reaches his or her full potential is to fight the stigma that prevents 
so many Americans with mental illness from making the most of their 
lives. In June of this year, under the leadership of Tipper Gore, we 
convened the first-ever White House Conference on Mental Health, where, 
among other important issues, we discussed how to reach out to troubled 
young people and put them on the path to mental and emotional health. 
The first and most crucial effort we can make is to talk honestly about 
mental illness and begin to dispel the myths that surround it. I am 
pleased that the Surgeon General and Mrs. Gore have committed to a major 
new campaign with these goals in mind. With powerful public service 
announcements and strong partners in the private sector, we can reach 
millions of Americans with a simple but life-changing message: Mental 
illness is nothing to be ashamed of, but bias and discrimination shame 
us all.
To acknowledge the importance of our children's health, the Congress, by 
joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), has 
called for the designation of the first Monday in October as ``Child 
Health Day'' and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in 
observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 4, 1999, as Child Health 
Day. I call upon families, schools, communities, and governments to 
dedicate themselves to protecting the health and well-being of all our 
children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7233 of October 5, 1999

German-American Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout America's history, we have drawn strength from the diversity 
of our people. Men and women from many different countries and cultures 
have arrived here, determined to forge a new life in a new land, and 
their talents have contributed to our national life. Germans were among 
the earliest ethnic groups to emigrate to America, arriving at William 
Penn's invitation more than 300 years ago. Whether motivated by the 
pursuit of religious liberty, intellectual freedom, or economic 
opportunity, the millions of Germans who have made their home in America 
have played an important part in advancing the peace and prosperity that 
our country enjoys today.
The achievements of notable German Americans have enriched every aspect 
of our society. The leadership of statesmen such as President Eisen

[[Page 116]]

hower and Henry Kissinger helped guide our Nation securely through the 
difficult Cold War years. The military acumen of German Americans has 
benefited us--from the Revolutionary War, when Baron Friedrich von 
Steuben's training programs brought discipline and organization to the 
Continental Army, to the Gulf War, when General Norman Schwarzkopf 
helped lead our troops to victory over Saddam Hussein. Prominent authors 
H. L. Mencken and Theodore Dreiser have enlightened our literary 
tradition, while inventors George Westinghouse and Charles Steinmetz 
have fueled our technological advancement. The world of American sports 
has been energized by outstanding athletes of German descent, providing 
a showcase for the talents of such greats as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
But by focusing on the achievements of prominent individuals, we risk 
understating the overall importance of the German heritage to our 
Nation's strength and development. Today, nearly one-quarter of all 
Americans can trace their ancestry to Germany, just as our English 
language finds its roots in the Germanic tongues of centuries past. 
German Americans honor the traditions of their lineage in the way they 
live, reflecting the sense of personal honor and strong work ethic 
passed down to them by their forebears.
As Americans seek to become a more united people, we must not forget our 
roots, for they remind us of who we are and of what we have to share 
with others. German-American Day offers us an invaluable opportunity not 
only to honor the contributions of German Americans, but also to 
celebrate the close relationship that we enjoy today with our German 
friends across the Atlantic. Next month, we will join them in 
commemorating the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall--a 
symbolic triumph of democracy and self-determination. As we look back on 
half a century of joint accomplishments with Germany that reflect our 
shared respect for the rule of law, human rights, and social justice, we 
can look ahead to a new era of cooperation, whether working together to 
restore peace to the war-torn Balkans or assisting the former Eastern 
Bloc nations on their own road to democratization and economic recovery.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, October 6, 
1999, as German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to applaud the 
important contributions made to our country by our millions of citizens 
of German descent and to celebrate our close ties to the people of 
Germany.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7234 of October 6, 1999

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In the more than two centuries that have passed since the signing of our 
Declaration of Independence, America has grown from a struggling 
democracy into the most powerful Nation on earth. But today, even as we 
enter the new century as a proud, prosperous, and free people, we must 
never forget those friends who cast their lot with us when the outcome 
of our bid for independence was unclear. Among those to whom we owe such 
a debt of gratitude is General Casimir Pulaski of Poland, who gave his 
life for our freedom on a Revolutionary War battlefield 220 years ago 
this month.
Casimir Pulaski had scarcely reached adulthood when he joined his father 
and brothers in the struggle for sovereignty for their native Poland. 
Though the Polish forces were skilled in battle, neighboring empires 
outnumbered and defeated them, and Pulaski himself was forced into 
exile. But soon the young soldier answered another call for freedom--
this time on behalf of the fledgling United States of America. He 
distinguished himself in his first military engagement in our War for 
Independence, and the Continental Congress immediately commissioned him 
as a brigadier general and assigned him to command the cavalry of the 
Continental Army. Fighting with characteristic valor and distinction, 
General Pulaski was killed during the Battle of Savannah and earned an 
enduring place in our Nation's history.
As we honor Casimir Pulaski this year, we give thanks that for the first 
time, Poles and Americans can proudly observe the anniversary of General 
Pulaski's death as NATO allies. In the years to come, both our peoples 
will continue to draw strength from the memory of Casimir Pulaski and 
from the courage and sacrifice of so many Poles and Polish Americans who 
have helped ensure the freedom, peace, and prosperity our two countries 
enjoy today.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 11, 1999, 
as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to 
commemorate this occasion with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7235 of October 7, 1999

To Delegate Authority for the Administration of the
Tariff-Rate Quotas on Sugar-Containing Products and Other Agricultural 
Products to the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of 
Agriculture

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

1. On April 15, 1994, the President entered into trade agreements 
resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations 
(``Uruguay Round Agreements''). As part of those agreements, the United 
States converted quotas on imports of beef, cotton, dairy products, 
peanuts, peanut butter and peanut paste, sugar, and sugar-containing 
products (as defined in additional U.S. notes 2 and 3 of the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States) into tariff-rate quotas. In 
section 101(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (the ``URAA'') 
(Public Law 103-65; 108 Stat. 4809), Congress approved the Uruguay Round 
Agreements listed in section 101(d) of that Act, including the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994.
2. On December 23, 1994, the President issued Presidential Proclamation 
6763, implementing the Uruguay Round Agreements consistent with the 
URAA. Presidential Proclamation 6763 included a delegation of the 
President's authority under the statutes cited in the proclamation, 
including section 404(a) of the URAA, 19 U.S.C. 3601(a), to the 
Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the United 
States Trade Representative, as necessary to perform functions assigned 
to them to implement the proclamation. Section 404(a) directs the 
President to take such action as may be necessary in implementing the 
tariff-rate quotas set out in Schedule XX - United States of America, 
annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade 1994, to ensure that imports of agricultural products do not 
disrupt the orderly marketing of commodities in the United States.
3. I have determined that it is necessary to delegate my authority under 
section 404(a) to administer the tariff-rate quotas relating to cotton, 
dairy products, peanuts, peanut butter and peanut paste, sugar, and 
sugar-containing products to the United States Trade Representative and 
to delegate to the Secretary of Agriculture authority to issue licenses 
governing the importation of such products under the applicable tariff-
rate quotas. The Secretary of Agriculture shall exercise such licensing 
authority in consultation with the United States Trade Representative.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 404(a) of the 
URAA, do hereby proclaim:
    (1) The United States Trade Representative is authorized to exercise 
my authority pursuant to section 404(a) of the URAA to take all action 
necessary, including the promulgation of regulations, to administer the 
tariff-rate quotas relating respectively, to cotton, dairy products, 
peanuts, peanut butter and peanut paste, sugar, and sugar-containing 
products, as the latter

[[Page 119]]

products are defined in additional U.S. notes 2 and 3 of the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture, in 
consultation with the United States Trade Representative, is authorized 
to exercise my authority pursuant to section 404(a) to issue import 
licenses governing the importation of such products within the 
applicable tariff-rate quotas.
    (2) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders 
that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are 
superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7236 of October 8, 1999

Leif Erikson Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In preparing for the new millennium, Americans have become increasingly 
aware of the richness of our Nation's history and heritage and of the 
generations of men and women whose contributions have brought us safely 
to this moment in our American journey.
One of those remarkable individuals was Leif Erikson, who led a small, 
intrepid band on a voyage of discovery across the North Atlantic from 
Greenland, arriving on the coast of North America almost a thousand 
years ago. The courage, resourcefulness, and fortitude of Leif Erikson 
and the other Viking seafarers foreshadowed the strength and character 
of the many Nordic pioneers who would make their own voyage to America 
centuries later. Building new lives through hard work, they also helped 
build our Nation and sustain our fundamental values of freedom, justice, 
and democracy.
The millions of Nordic Americans who have contributed so much to our 
peace and prosperity through the decades have also strengthened the 
bonds of friendship between the United States and the people of Denmark, 
Finland, Iceland, Sweden, and Norway. With a shared past and common 
ideals, we have worked in partnership to promote democracy and 
opportunity around the world. Through our Northern European Initiative, 
the Nordic countries and the United States continue to promote our 
common values in the region and to facilitate Baltic and Russian 
integration into Western institutions.
The next millennium will hold great challenge and great promise for our 
Nation and for the people of the Nordic countries. We have only to look 
back on the achievements of Leif Erikson to rekindle our spirit of 
adventure and to inspire us as we embark on our own exploration of the 
uncharted territory of the future.

[[Page 120]]

In honor of Leif Erikson, son of Iceland, grandson of Norway, the 
Congress, by joint resolution approved on September 2, 1964 (Public Law 
88-566), has authorized and requested the President to proclaim October 
9 of each year as ``Leif Erikson Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 1999, as Leif Erikson Day. I 
encourage the people of the United States to observe this occasion with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities commemorating our rich Nordic 
American heritage.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7237 of October 8, 1999

National School Lunch Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than 50 years, the National School Lunch Program has been at 
the forefront of our Nation's effort to promote the health and well-
being of our children. Created to ensure that all children in our Nation 
receive the nourishment they need to develop into healthy and productive 
adults, the program provides nutritious lunches to more than 26 million 
children each day in 95,000 schools and residential child care 
institutions across the country. For many children, this free or 
reduced-price meal is often the most nutritious meal of their day.
Equally important, the National School Lunch Program provides our 
children with the fuel they need to remain alert and attentive in the 
classroom. Common sense tells us--and scientific research confirms--that 
a hungry child cannot focus on learning and that a child who does not 
eat properly is more likely to be sick and absent from school. Day in 
and day out, school lunches give our children the energy to learn today, 
while helping them prepare for the challenges of the future.
An array of nutrition programs now supplements the National School Lunch 
Program. Whether providing schoolchildren with a good breakfast or a 
healthy afternoon snack, the School Breakfast Program, the Summer School 
Food Service Program, the Special Milk Program, and the Child and Adult 
Care Food Program help ensure that our children eat nutritious and 
healthy meals throughout the day. As we observe this special week, let 
us reaffirm the belief of President Harry Truman, founder of the school 
lunch program, that ``Nothing is more important in our national life 
than the welfare of our children, and proper nourishment comes first in 
attaining this welfare.''
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch Program 
to the health, education, and well-being of our Nation's children, the 
Con

[[Page 121]]

gress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), has 
designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in October of each 
year as ``National School Lunch Week'' and has requested the President 
to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 10 through October 16, 1999, as 
National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize all 
those individuals whose efforts contribute so much to the success of our 
national child nutrition programs, whether at the Federal, State, or 
local level.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7238 of October 8, 1999

National Children's Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The children of America are our most precious gift and our greatest 
responsibility. Their well-being is one of the greatest measures of our 
success as a society, and our ability to provide them with a loving, 
safe, and supportive environment will help determine the character of 
our Nation.
We can be proud of the progress we have made in creating such 
environments. To strengthen families and homes, we have provided tax 
relief to working families, raised the minimum wage, and enacted the 
Family and Medical Leave Act so that parents can take time off to be 
with a sick child or new baby without putting their jobs at risk. To 
give more children a healthy start in life, we have extended health care 
coverage to millions of previously uninsured children. To help America's 
youth reach their full potential, my Administration has urged the 
Congress to pass legislation to provide our students with a first-rate 
education by ensuring that they are educated by well-prepared teachers, 
in smaller classes, in modern and safe buildings, and with the latest in 
information technology.
On National Children's Day, however, we must also reflect soberly on how 
far we still have to go to make our communities safe and nurturing 
places for our children. One of our greatest challenges is to provide 
health coverage for the almost 11 million American children who are 
still uninsured. Many of these children are eligible for Medicaid or 
qualify for coverage under the Children's Health Insurance Programs that 
are now operating in every State across our Nation. Educators, 
policymakers, health care professionals, and business, community, and 
media leaders have a vital role to play in raising parents' awareness of 
their children's eligibility for this important coverage and making sure 
that these children are enrolled.

[[Page 122]]

America must also confront the recent senseless acts of violence that 
have taken the lives and the innocence of so many young people. Places 
where they once felt safe--schools and churches and day care 
facilities--have been shaken by violence. Addressing this assault on our 
society's values and our children's future is a top priority of my 
Administration. We must work together--parents, students, educators, 
public officials, and religious, community, and industry leaders--to 
instill in our youth a sense of compassion, tolerance, and self-respect, 
so that they may find their way in a troubled world. We must also help 
them develop the strength to express their own anger and alienation with 
words, not weapons.
One of the most powerful tools we have in this endeavor is youth 
mentoring. A recent Department of Justice study showed that mentoring 
programs help young people resist violence and substance abuse, perform 
better academically, and interact more positively with their families 
and with other youth. Recognizing the value of mentoring programs, 
particularly to the well-being of millions of at-risk youth, my 
Administration announced earlier this year several public and private 
initiatives to encourage mentoring, and we set aside $14 million in 
grants for the Justice Department's Juvenile Mentoring Program.
Children bring so much hope, joy, and love to our lives; in return, we 
owe them our time, our attention, the power of our example, and the 
comfort of our concern. It is a fair trade, and one that enriches the 
lives of us all.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 10, 1999, as 
National Children's Day. I urge all Americans to express their love and 
appreciation for the children of our Nation on this day and on every day 
throughout the year. I invite Federal officials, local governments, 
communities, and all American families to join in observing this day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also urge all Americans to 
reflect upon the importance of children to our families, the importance 
of strong families to our children, and the importance of both to 
America.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7239 of October 8, 1999

Columbus Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Although Christopher Columbus' first voyage to the New World took place 
more than 500 years ago, the momentous changes it brought about still 
resonate today. His journey triggered a historic encounter between 
Europe and the native peoples of the New World; helped open new 
continents to ex

[[Page 123]]

ploration, trade, and development; established a reliable route to the 
Americas; and was a major milestone in the inexorable trend toward 
expansion and globalization.
Columbus could not have imagined the full impact of his arrival in 1492 
or how his journey would shape human history. The zeal for trade that 
motivated the Spanish crown to fund Columbus' voyages still exists today 
as we work to strengthen our commercial ties with other nations and to 
compete in an increasingly global economy. Columbus' own passion for 
adventure survives as an integral part of our national character and 
heritage, reflected in our explorations of the oceans' depths and the 
outer reaches of our solar system. A son of Italy, Columbus opened the 
door to the New World for millions of people from across the globe who 
have followed their dreams to America. Today, Americans of Italian and 
Spanish descent can take special pride, not only in Columbus' historic 
achievements, but also in their own immeasurable contributions to our 
national life. From business to the arts, from government to academia, 
they have played an important part in advancing the peace and prosperity 
our country enjoys today.
We are about to embark on our own journey into a new millennium of 
unknown challenges and possibilities. As we ponder that future, 
Columbus' courage and daring still capture the American imagination, 
inspiring us to look to the horizon, as he did, and see, not a daunting 
boundary, but a new world full of opportunity.
In tribute to Columbus' many achievements, the Congress, by joint 
resolution of April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), and an Act of June 28, 1968 
(82 Stat. 250), has requested the President to proclaim the second 
Monday in October of each year as ``Columbus Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 11, 1999, as Columbus Day. I call 
upon the people of the United States to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also direct that the flag of 
the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of Christopher Columbus.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7240 of October 15, 1999

White Cane Safety Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The white cane is widely recognized as a symbol of independence for 
people who are blind or visually impaired. This simple device has given 
freedom to generations of blind Americans by enabling them to move 
through their communities with greater ease, confidence, and safety.

[[Page 124]]

Dr. Kenneth Jernigan, former President of the National Federation of the 
Blind who died just a year ago this month, was an early advocate of the 
white cane and the full integration of blind people into every aspect of 
society. Dr. Jernigan used the white cane himself and recognized its 
power as a means to allow blind people to leave the confines of their 
homes for the outside world--to go to school and to work and to make 
ever-greater contributions to their communities.
Thanks to enormous advances in technology, people who are blind or 
visually impaired now have additional tools--such as voice recognition 
software, computer screen readers, and braille translators--to assist 
them in carrying out their responsibilities on the job. My 
Administration has proposed increased investment in such assistive 
technology as well as a $1,000 tax credit to help people with 
disabilities offset the cost of special transportation requirements and 
work-related expenses. I have also strongly urged the Congress to pass 
the Work Incentives Improvement Act so that Americans with disabilities 
can go to work without jeopardizing their Medicare or Medicaid coverage.
We can be heartened today that many barriers to full inclusion for blind 
Americans have been dismantled. But the greatest barrier still remains: 
the attitude of too many sighted people that those who are blind or 
visually impaired are incapable of holding their own in the working 
world. On White Cane Safety Day, let us reaffirm our national commitment 
to providing equal opportunity for all Americans, regardless of 
disability.
To honor the many achievements of blind and visually impaired citizens 
and to recognize the white cane's significance in advancing 
independence, the Congress, by joint resolution approved October 6, 
1964, has designated October 15 of each year as ``White Cane Safety 
Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1999, as White Cane Safety Day. 
I call upon the people of the United States, government officials, 
educators, and business leaders to observe this day with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7241 of October 15, 1999

National Forest Products Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From our earliest days as a Nation, America's forests have played a 
vital role in fostering our country's economic strength and enhancing 
the quality of our lives. American Indians and European settlers alike 
found in our forests the fuel and material for shelter to sustain their 
families and commu

[[Page 125]]

nities. From those same forests came timber for our fleets of sailing 
ships and the ties for our railroads that span the continent. Whether 
working in lumber mills or paper mills, for furniture manufacturers or 
the building industry, generations of Americans have earned their 
livelihood from the bounty of our forests.
Forests bring more, however, to our lives than economic prosperity. They 
provide invaluable habitat for a variety of plants and animals, help to 
keep our air and water clean, and promote soil stability. They also 
renew our spirits by offering us a place to experience the beauty, 
peace, and diversity of the natural world.
As our Nation has grown and developed, so too have our demands on our 
forests. We can be grateful that, despite decades of exploitation, 
forests still comprise as much as one-third of our country's land area 
today. Thanks to innovative management techniques, individual and 
corporate commitment to recycling, and close cooperation between 
Federal, State, and private land owners, we are succeeding in sustaining 
the health and productivity of these precious natural resources. Through 
continued wise stewardship, we can ensure that future generations of 
Americans will have the same opportunities to share the beauty and 
bounty of our forests as we enjoy today.
To recognize the importance of our forests in ensuring the long-term 
welfare of our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 
123), has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October 
of each year as ``National Forest Products Week'' and has authorized and 
requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this 
week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim October 17 through October 23, 1999, as 
National Forest Products Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this 
week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

<R05>
Proclamation 7242 of October 16, 1999

National Character Counts Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The character of our citizens has enriched every aspect of our national 
life and has set an example of civic responsibility for people around 
the world. The diligence and determination that are part of our Nation's 
work ethic have strengthened our economy, and the firm convictions of 
our spiritual leaders have helped guide our communities, fostering 
unity, compassion, and humility.
In this dynamic time of unparalleled opportunity and possibility, our 
children will encounter a variety of new challenges that will test the 
strength

[[Page 126]]

of their character and convictions. As the dawn of the new millennium 
fast approaches, we must work together--parents, public officials, 
educators, entertainers, and business and religious leaders--to impart 
to our youth the core values they need to be good citizens.
We know that parents play a critical role in imparting moral values to 
their children. But in today's complex and fast-paced society, when 
parents must spend longer hours at work and more families are headed by 
a single parent, parents have less time to spend with their children--an 
average decrease of 22 hours a week over the past 30 years, according to 
a report released this spring by my Council of Economic Advisers. We 
must seek innovative ways to address this problem and to promote 
stronger families, including greater flexibility in paid work hours, 
more affordable child care, and increased support for low-income 
families.
My Administration is committed to providing families with the tools they 
need to fulfill their responsibilities at home and at work. Our agenda 
includes tripling our investment in after-school programs through the 
21st Century Community Learning Center program and a historic initiative 
to make child care better, safer, and more affordable for working 
families. We are also working to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act 
to cover more workers and to allow leave for more parental activities, 
such as parent-teacher conferences and routine doctor visits.
While Americans are striving to seize the opportunities presented by 
this exciting new era, we must continue to preserve the fundamental 
ideals and ethics that have sustained our country for more than two 
centuries. By sustaining these shared values and passing them on to our 
children, we can realize our common hope for a more just and honorable 
society and a brighter future for the generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 17 through October 
23, 1999, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon the people of 
the United States, government officials, educators, religious, 
community, and business leaders, and the States to commemorate this week 
with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7243 of October 21, 1999

National Day of Concern About Young People and Gun
Violence, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Events of the past year have dramatically demonstrated the continuing 
need for a National Day of Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. 
In communities across our country, we saw young lives cut short by 
gunfire. We watched, horrified, as the same scene played out repeatedly 
in classrooms, school yards, and places of worship. Out of cities like 
Fort Worth, Texas; Conyers, Georgia; Granada Hills, California; and 
Littleton, Colorado, came the images that have become painfully 
familiar--racing ambulances, terrified children, grieving families. As a 
national community, we shared a sense of devastating loss too immediate 
to comprehend. Behind these headlines, every day in our Nation 12 young 
people die as a result of gun violence.
In response to this disturbing cycle, my Administration has taken 
comprehensive action against youth violence. Last October, we held the 
first-ever White House Conference on School Safety, where I launched a 
new initiative to increase the number of safety officers in schools and 
unveiled a new plan to help schools respond to violence. After the 
tragedy in Littleton, we held a Summit on Youth Violence at which we 
launched a national campaign to end youth violence.
Earlier this month, I established the White House Council on Youth 
Violence to ensure the effective coordination of the many agencies and 
programs of the Federal Government that address youth violence issues. 
In addition, we have selected 54 communities to receive more than $100 
million in Safe Schools/Healthy Students grants in an effort to find and 
fund the best ideas to reduce youth violence through community-based 
collaborative efforts. These funds will allow communities to implement 
important measures such as hiring more security personnel, installing 
security equipment, and improving student mental health services.
I have also called upon the Congress to do its part by passing a 
juvenile crime bill that closes the dangerous gun show loophole, 
requires child safety locks for guns, and bans the importation of large-
capacity ammunition clips. I will continue to fight hard to win passage 
of these commonsense measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
As we observe this year's National Day of Concern About Young People and 
Gun Violence, I encourage every student in America to sign a Student 
Pledge Against Gun Violence, a solemn oath never to bring a gun to 
school and never to use a gun to settle a dispute. More than one million 
students signed the pledge last year, and I hope that many more will 
participate this year. I also urge all Americans to make their voices 
heard and support efforts to reduce gun violence. We need every sector 
of our society--families, educators, communities, businesses, religious 
leaders, policymakers, and members of law enforcement--to join together 
in this crusade to end the cycle of violence and create a brighter, 
safer future for our children.

[[Page 128]]

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 21, 1999, as a 
National Day of Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. On this 
day, I call upon all Americans to commit themselves anew to helping our 
young people avoid violence, to setting a good example, and to restoring 
our schools and neighborhoods as safe havens for learning and 
recreation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

<R05>
Proclamation 7244 of October 22, 1999

United Nations Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As the 20th century draws to a close, Americans are taking time to 
reflect on the institutions that have shaped our past and that hold 
great hope for our future. One of the most important of these 
institutions is the United Nations. A dream of peace rising from the 
ashes of World War II, the U.N. has made great strides toward fulfilling 
the goals of its founders by saving lives, enhancing the security of 
law-abiding nations, and improving living conditions across the globe. 
This year, in marking the 54th anniversary of the founding of the U.N., 
we celebrate not only the organization's many accomplishments, but also 
its potential to bring the family of nations together to work toward a 
more peaceful, democratic, just, and prosperous world.
Since the U.N.'s founding more than half a century ago, humankind has 
learned a great deal--how to produce enough food for growing 
populations, how human activity affects the environment, how 
telecommunications can link the countries of the world into a single 
global community. But one of the most important lessons humanity has 
learned is one that Americans have always known: open societies are more 
just and open markets create more wealth.
Through the United Nations, America has access to a powerful forum where 
we can join with the other peoples of the world to raise awareness of 
these truths and to advance common interests and shared values. During 
the past decade, U.N. conferences have brought together nearly 50,000 
people in Beijing to advance the rights and well-being of women; 47,000 
in Rio de Janeiro to discuss ways to promote development while 
protecting the environment; and 30,000 people in Istanbul to seek 
solutions to urban problems.
In the last year alone, we have seen abundant evidence of the ways in 
which the United Nations benefits America and the world. The United 
Nations is the primary multilateral forum to press for international 
human

[[Page 129]]

rights and lead governments to improve their relations with their 
neighbors and their own people. As we saw during the Kosovo conflict, 
and more recently with regard to East Timor, the perpetrators of ethnic 
cleansing and mass murder can find no refuge in the United Nations and 
no source of comfort in its charter. It is the institution the 
international community turns to in pursuit of solutions to armed 
conflict. It is the primary vehicle for broad international cooperation 
in addressing the needs of refugees and of the tens of millions of 
people around the world who remain mired in abject poverty. The United 
Nations and its affiliated agencies also provide a powerful voice for 
upholding and furthering the development of the rule of law and 
standards of international commerce--rules and standards that are 
crucial to global and economic stability and progress.
In acknowledging the far-reaching contributions of the United Nations to 
the international community, we must renew our commitment to work with 
our fellow U.N. members to advance international peace and prosperity 
and to champion human rights. In achieving these goals, the United 
Nations should make wise use of the international resources at its 
disposal; and the United States should meet its obligation to provide 
our share of these resources. By doing so, we can ensure that the United 
Nations will be an integral player in making the next millennium an era 
of unprecedented global peace, security, and prosperity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 1999, as 
United Nations Day. I encourage all Americans to acquaint themselves 
with the activities and accomplishments of the United Nations and to 
observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities 
furthering the goal of international cooperation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day 
of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7245 of October 28, 1999

National Adoption Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This month, as families across America look forward to the holiday 
season that is fast approaching, we remember with special concern the 
thousands of children in our Nation who are growing up without the 
unconditional love and security of a permanent home. Our Nation's foster 
care system plays an invaluable role in providing temporary safe and 
caring homes to children who need them, but permanent homes and families 
are vital to giving these children the stability and sustained love they 
need to reach their full potential.

[[Page 130]]

My Administration has worked hard to promote adoption by assisting 
adoptive families and breaking down barriers to adoption. We have helped 
remove many economic barriers to adoption by providing tax credits to 
families adopting children, and the Family and Medical Leave Act that I 
signed into law in 1993 gives workers job-protected leave to care for 
their newly adopted children. The Adoption and Safe Families Act I 
signed in 1997 reformed our Nation's child welfare system, made clear 
that the health and safety of children must be the paramount concern of 
State child welfare services, and expedited permanent placement for 
children. It also ensured health coverage for children with special 
needs and created new financial incentives for States to increase 
adoption. We also took important steps to help ensure that the adoption 
process remains free from discrimination and delays on the basis of 
race, culture, and ethnicity. We are now working to break down 
geographic barriers to adoption by using the Internet to link children 
in foster care to possible adoptive families.
We have new evidence that our efforts are bearing fruit: the first 
significant increase in adoptions since the National Foster Care Program 
was created almost 20 years ago. A new report from the Department of 
Health and Human Services shows that from 1996 to 1998, the number of 
adoptions nationwide rose 29 percent--from 28,000 to 36,000--and should 
meet our national goal of 56,000 adoptions by the year 2002. In 
addition, the First Lady and I were pleased to announce this past 
September the first-ever bonus awards to States that have increased the 
number of adoptions from the public foster care system. We also 
announced additional grants to public and private organizations that 
remove barriers to adoption.
To follow through on this record of achievement, I have urged the 
Congress to safeguard the interests and well-being of young people who 
reach the age of 18 without being adopted or placed in a permanent home. 
Under the current system, Federal financial assistance for young people 
in foster care ends just as they are making the critical transition to 
independence. We must ensure that when these young people are old enough 
to leave the foster care system, they have the health care, life skills 
training, and educational opportunities they need to succeed personally 
and professionally.
As we observe National Adoption Month this year, we can take pride in 
our progress, but we know there is more work to be done. Let us take 
this opportunity to rededicate ourselves to meeting those challenges, 
and let us honor the many adoptive parents whose generosity and love 
have made such an extraordinary difference in the lives of thousands of 
our Nation's children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1999 as National 
Adoption Month. I urge all Americans to observe this month with 
appropriate programs and activities to honor adoptive families and to 
participate in efforts to find permanent, loving homes for waiting 
children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day 
of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, 
and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7246 of October 30, 1999

Child Mental Health Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As a Nation, we have made much progress in ensuring the physical health 
of our young people. But we are only beginning to make similar strides 
in protecting their mental health. The symptoms of mental illness in 
children and adolescents too often go unrecognized and therefore 
untreated--a tragic failing that can lead to profound effects on their 
development. Even very young children can experience anxiety and 
depressive disorders that can have a long-term negative impact on their 
social interactions at home and at school.
Unfortunately, our attitudes regarding mental illness have compounded 
this problem. While we now know that more than one in five Americans 
experiences some form of mental illness each year, that many mental 
disorders are biological, and that they can be treated medically, too 
many people still believe that mental illness is a personal failure. 
Because of this widespread misconception, many parents are reluctant to 
acknowledge that their children need help, and many children who need 
help are afraid to ask for it.
During Child Mental Health Month, I encourage all parents, teachers, 
pediatricians, school nurses, other health care professionals, and 
concerned citizens across our country to learn more about children's 
mental health. By doing so, we can recognize more quickly the early 
warning signs of mental illnesses and disorders. We can detect 
depression before it deepens into serious illness, raise awareness of 
risk factors for suicide, and work to prevent more acts of youth 
violence.
We must do all we can to intervene in the lives of young people who are 
mentally or emotionally unstable before they cause harm to themselves or 
to others. I am pleased that some schools have responded to the recent 
youth violence tragedies by improving mental health services, expanding 
after-school and mentoring programs, and offering in-home counseling for 
vulnerable families. To ensure the success of these efforts, we must 
work to fight the stigma and dispel the myths that surround mental 
illness. By engaging in efforts that raise public awareness of our 
children's mental health, we can replace stigma with acceptance, 
ignorance with understanding, and fear with new hope for the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1999 as Child 
Mental Health Month. I call upon families, schools, communities, and 
governments to dedicate themselves to promoting the mental health and 
well-being of all our children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of

Proclamation 7247 of November 1, 1999

National American Indian Heritage Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ours is a nation inextricably linked to the histories of the many 
peoples who first inhabited this great land. Everywhere around us are 
reminders of the legacy of America's first inhabitants. Their history 
speaks to us through the names of our cities, lakes, and rivers; the 
food on our tables; the magnificent ruins of ancient communities; and, 
most important, the lives of the people who retain the cultural, 
spiritual, linguistic, and kinship bonds that have existed for 
millennia.
As we reflect on the heritage of American Indians, Alaska Natives, and 
Native Hawaiians, we also reaffirm our commitment to fostering a 
prosperous future for native youth and children. At the foundation of 
these efforts is our work to provide a quality education to all Native 
American children. In particular, we have sought significantly increased 
funding to support Bureau of Indian Affairs school construction and 
1,000 new teachers for American Indian youth. My 1998 Executive order on 
American Indian and Alaska Native Education sets goals to improve high 
school completion rates and improve performance in reading and 
mathematics. And we are working to get computers into every classroom 
and to expand the use of educational technology.
We are also seeking ways to empower Native American communities and help 
them prosper. My Administration is expanding consultation and 
collaborative decision-making with tribal governments to promote self-
determination. We also support tribal government economic development 
initiatives, particularly those that increase or enhance the 
infrastructure necessary for long-term economic growth. My New Markets 
Initiative seeks to leverage public and private investment to boost 
economic development in areas that have not shared in our recent 
national prosperity. In July, I visited the Pine Ridge Reservation of 
the Oglala Sioux, as part of my New Markets Tour, to explore 
opportunities for economic development in Indian Country.
Among the most serious barriers to economic growth facing tribal 
communities is a lack of housing, physical infrastructure, and essential 
services. My Administration is working with tribal leaders to build and 
renovate affordable housing on tribal lands, bring quality drinking 
water to economically distressed Indian communities, and improve public 
safety. We are moving to assist tribal governments in developing the 
physical infrastructure needed for economic development, including 
roads, fiber-optic cabling, and electric power lines.
In working together to shape a brighter future for Indian Country, we 
must not lose sight of the rich history of Native Americans. Just weeks 
ago, the

[[Page 133]]

Smithsonian Institution broke ground on the National Mall for the 
National Museum of the American Indian. This wonderful facility will 
preserve and celebrate the art, history, and culture of America's 
indigenous peoples. It is also fitting that the first U.S. dollar coin 
of the new millennium will bear the likeness of Sacajawea and her infant 
son--an image that captures the importance of our shared history.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 1999 as National 
American Indian Heritage Month. I urge all Americans, as well as their 
elected representatives at the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels, 
to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7248 of November 8, 1999

Veterans Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Throughout U.S. history, Americans have kept a special place of honor in 
their hearts for our veterans; and for more than 70 years, we have set 
aside each November 11 to recognize the men and women who have so 
valiantly served America. On this day, we remember and pay tribute to 
the millions of patriots whose courage and sacrifice have secured our 
freedom--from those who suffered through the harsh winter at Valley 
Forge to those who preserved our Union on the battlefields of Gettysburg 
to those who turned back the tide of tyranny and hatred on the beaches 
of Normandy to those who have kept the peace and defended our values 
around the globe.
Since the first days of our independence, brave Americans have stepped 
forward to protect our country and promote our ideals. Some 48 million 
men and women from every corner of our country and from every walk of 
life have served in our Nation's Armed Forces, and 41 million of them 
have done so under hostile conditions. Their service often put them in 
harm's way, far from home and family, and too often it cost them their 
lives.
Time and again, America has called on her men and women in uniform to 
protect our national security, to advance our national interests, and to 
preserve our rights and freedoms. And time and again, our Armed Forces 
have responded by overcoming daunting challenges to achieve hard-fought 
victories. In battles that would determine our Nation's destiny, in wars 
that would decide the fate of the free world, in peacekeeping missions 
that would change forever the lives and futures of peoples fighting 
oppression, they have persevered in the face of adversity and have 
prevailed.

[[Page 134]]

Such victories do not come easily. They exact a heavy toll in lives cut 
short, in families bereft, in human potential unfulfilled. It is a toll 
paid by the 25 million veterans still living among us, who every day 
carry with them the indelible memories of sacrifices made, battles 
fought, and comrades lost.
To pay tribute to those who have served in our Armed Forces, the 
Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year 
shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor America's 
veterans. For all their sacrifices and for the peace, prosperity, and 
liberty their service has secured for us, our Nation owes our veterans a 
profound debt of gratitude. In commemorating this solemn day, we express 
our deep appreciation for the duties they have discharged.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 11, 1999, as Veterans 
Day. I urge all Americans to honor our veterans through appropriate 
public ceremonies and private prayers. I call upon Federal, State, and 
local government officials to display the flag of the United States and 
to encourage and participate in patriotic activities in their 
communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places of 
worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this 
national observance with suitable commemorative expressions and 
programs.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons 
Responsible for Repression of the Civilian Population in Kosovo or for 
Policies That Obstruct Democracy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro) (``FRY'') or Otherwise Lend Support to the 
Current Governments of the FRY and of the Republic of Serbia

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

In light of the actions of President Slobodan Milosevic and other 
officials of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) 
(``FRY'') and the Republic of Serbia against elements of the civilian 
population of Kosovo, including actions within the jurisdiction of the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia; in light of 
actions being taken by the Milosevic regime to obstruct democracy and to 
suppress an independent media and freedom of the press in the FRY, 
Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo; and in light of the ongoing efforts of 
the Milosevic regime and

[[Page 135]]

its supporters to thwart the economic sanctions imposed by the United 
States and other countries against the FRY, I have determined that it is 
in the interests of the United States to suspend the entry into the 
United States of certain officials of the FRY Government and the 
Government of the Republic of Serbia and of other persons who either act 
in support of such officials' policies or who are closely associated

President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
America, including section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
of 1952, as amended (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, 
United States Code, hereby find that the unrestricted immigrant and 
nonimmigrant entry into the United States of persons described in

to establish a peaceful and stable democracy in these areas;
    (c) Officials of the Government of the FRY or of the Republic of 
Serbia and FRY nationals who, individually or as officers or employees 
of business or financial entities, engage in financial transactions that 
materially support the Government of the FRY, the Government of the 
Republic of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, or members of the Milosevic 
regime; and
    (d) Any spouse, minor child, close relative, or close personal 
associate of any person described in subsections (a) through (c) above, 
if the entry into the United States of such spouse, minor child, close 
relative, or close personal associate would not be in the interests of 
the United States in light of the objectives of this proclamation.
Sec. 2. Section 1 shall not apply with respect to any person otherwise 
covered by section 1 where the entry of such person would not be 
contrary to the interests of the United States.
Sec. 3. Persons covered by sections 1 and 2 shall be identified by the 
Secretary of State, or the Secretary's designee, in the Secretary or the 
Secretary's designee's sole discretion, pursuant to such procedures as 
the Secretary may establish under section 5 below.
Sec. 4. Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed to derogate from 
United States Government obligations under applicable international 
agreements.
Sec. 5. The Secretary of State shall have responsibility to implement 
this proclamation pursuant to procedures the Secretary may establish.

[[Page 136]]

Sec. 6. This proclamation is effective immediately and shall remain in 
effect, in whole or in part, until such time as the Secretary of State 
determines that it is no longer necessary and should be terminated, in 
whole or in part.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7250 of November 15, 1999

America Recycles Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Recycling is one of the great success stories in America's crusade to 
protect our environment and preserve our natural resources. Americans 
have undergone a fundamental change in attitude about recycling during 
the past 4 decades. Where most Americans and many industries were once 
unmindful of our resources and careless in disposing of waste materials, 
people across our country now recognize the importance of recycling and 
have made it part of their daily routines. In 1996 alone, recycling 
nationwide diverted a total of 57 million tons of material away from 
landfills and incinerators--more than a quarter of our country's annual 
municipal solid waste.
Nonetheless, the recycling process is complete only when recovered 
materials return to the market as new products for purchase by 
consumers. The most effective way we can ensure the continued success of 
recycling in America is to expand markets for products that contain 
recycled materials. Buying recycled products conserves resources, 
reduces water and air pollution, saves energy, and creates jobs. 
Producing 1 ton of paper from recycled pulp saves 17 trees, 3 cubic 
yards of landfill space, and 7000 gallons of water. It also reduces air 
pollutants by 60 pounds, saves 390 gallons of oil, and conserves 4200 
kilowatt hours of energy--enough to heat a home for half a year. 
Estimates show that 9 jobs are created for every 15,000 tons of solid 
waste recycled into new products.
The U.S. Government has helped promote recycling by purchasing recycled-
content products--in fiscal 1997 alone, we purchased $354 million worth 
of such products. In September of 1998, I was proud to sign Executive 
Order 13101--Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, 
Recycling, and Federal Acquisition--which directed all Federal agencies 
to expand and strengthen the Federal Government's dedication to 
recycling and to buying products made with recycled content. This 
responsible use of Government purchasing power will not only help the 
environment, but will also stimulate the growth of clean industries in 
the 21st century.
America Recycles Day unites business and industry, environmental and 
civic groups, and local, State, and Federal Government agencies to 
encourage recycling. This partnership challenges all businesses and 
consumers in

[[Page 137]]

America to increase their purchases of recycled products, to boost their 
recycling efforts, and to start new recycling programs. The theme for 
this year's observance--``For Our Children's Future . . . Buy Recycled 
Today''--reminds us of the profound and long-term implications of the 
actions we take today. By using products with recycled content and 
creating new markets for such products, we will conserve America's 
precious natural resources for the benefit of generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 1999, as 
America Recycles Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities and to take personal 
responsibility for the environment not only by recycling, but also by 
choosing to purchase and use products made from recycled materials.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

<R05>
Proclamation 7251 of November 18, 1999

National Great American Smokeout Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Tobacco use continues to be the leading preventable cause of death and 
disease in the United States, costing more than 400,000 lives and $50 
billion in medical expenses each year. Some 3,000 Americans under the 
age of 18 become regular smokers every day, and we know that at least 
1,000 of these new smokers will die prematurely from a tobacco-related 
disease. As caring adults and responsible citizens, we must do all we 
can to keep another generation of Americans from succumbing to the lure 
of tobacco. Each year, the Great American Smokeout provides people 
across our Nation with an opportunity to stand united in our efforts to 
help smokers quit and to convince our fellow citizens who don't smoke 
that they should not start.
Some positive statistics reinforce this message. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each year an estimated 1.2 
million adult smokers successfully quit smoking--permanently. Smokers 
who quit before age 50 substantially increase their expected lifespan, 
compared with those who continue smoking after they turn 50. Former 
smokers also reduce their risk for coronary heart disease, 
cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, emphysema, and stroke.
My Administration has worked hard to identify the best practices for 
preventing tobacco use among our young people and encouraging those who 
do smoke to quit. I have asked the Congress to discourage young people 
from smoking by funding important health programs and raising the price 
of cigarettes. I have also urged the States to invest a portion of the 
substan

[[Page 138]]

tial funds they acquired in last year's settlement with tobacco 
companies in programs that help reduce youth smoking while not 
abandoning tobacco farmers and their communities.
During this 23rd Great American Smokeout, I encourage all Americans to 
create a healthy, tobacco-free environment for themselves, their 
children, and their fellow citizens. I also ask that part of this 
special day be spent engaging youth in discussions about the dangers of 
tobacco use, teaching them how to establish healthy lifestyles, and 
helping them to develop effective measures for becoming or remaining 
tobacco-free.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 18, 1999, as 
National Great American Smokeout Day. I call upon all Americans to join 
together in an effort to educate our children about the dangers of 
tobacco use, and I urge both smokers and nonsmokers to take this 
opportunity to practice a healthy lifestyle that sets a positive example 
for young people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7252 of November 18, 1999

National Farm-City Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As we gather with family and friends to celebrate Thanksgiving and to 
express our gratitude for the many blessings bestowed on ourselves and 
our Nation, we must also give thanks for the special relationship 
between America's farms and cities--a relationship that has strengthened 
our economy and helped to sustain people across America and around the 
world.
Throughout our Nation's history, America's farmers and ranchers have 
provided us with an abundant, affordable supply of food and fiber. As we 
prepare to enter the 21st century, we recognize that rural America will 
continue to be a cornerstone of our national prosperity. Generating more 
than 22 million jobs and contributing a trillion dollars each year to 
our economy, American agriculture is one of our most important and 
productive industries.
However, farmers and ranchers do not live or work in isolation; the 
labor of many people, both rural and urban Americans, helps provide the 
agricultural products so vital to our health, our prosperity, and our 
quality of life. What connects farms and ranches with urban stores and 
consumers is a network of farmers, ranchers, agribusiness industries, 
scientists, inspectors, shippers, retail distributors, and others who 
work together to grow, process, and share the bounty of our great land.

[[Page 139]]

During National Farm-City Week, let us pause to give thanks for that 
bounty. Let us acknowledge the efforts of the many hardworking men and 
women across our country who dedicate their lives to producing the 
world's safest, most abundant supply of food and fiber. And let us be 
thankful for the strength and productivity of the working relationship 
between America's rural and urban communities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 19 through 
November 25, 1999, as National Farm-City Week. I call upon all 
Americans, in rural and urban communities alike, to recognize the 
achievements of all those who work together to promote America's 
agricultural abundance.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7253 of November 19, 1999

National Family Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Families are the foundation of our individual lives and the life of our 
Nation. We turn to our families for the nurturing, guidance, and 
unconditional love that sustain us; from them we learn the values and 
convictions that sustain our society.
I am proud of my Administration's commitment to providing families with 
the resources they need to flourish. We have strengthened family incomes 
through the Child Tax Credit and by increasing the minimum wage and 
expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, and today the yearly income of a 
typical American family is higher than it has ever been in our Nation's 
history. We have opened the doors of higher education by making student 
loans less expensive and easier to repay and by providing new tax 
credits and larger Pell Grant scholarships. We are also working to 
ensure that parents have access to quality and affordable child care for 
their children. These and other family-friendly policies, such as the 
Family and Medical Leave Act I signed into law in 1993, have helped 
parents to balance the demands of work and family and have brought 
increased financial security, expanded opportunity, and renewed hope for 
the future to families across America.
As we look to that future, we must not forget our rich history. We are 
fast approaching the dawn of a new millennium, and my Administration is 
marking this historic milestone with family-oriented programs that honor 
the past and imagine the future. Through ``My History is America's 
History,'' a project sponsored by the White House Millennium Council and 
the

[[Page 140]]

National Endowment for the Humanities, we are encouraging our Nation's 
families to rediscover America's history by recording and preserving 
their own stories and passing them on to the next generation. Through 
remembered conversations, restored photographs, treasured letters, 
diaries, or other keepsakes, each family can recognize and preserve its 
part in America's rich and complex story and give a priceless gift to 
the future.
As we gather in our homes once again at this time of thanksgiving, let 
us recognize that the family members who surround us are among the most 
precious blessings in our lives, and let us pledge to keep their stories 
alive for the benefit of generations to come.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21 through 
November 27, 1999, as National Family Week. I call upon Federal, State, 
and local officials to honor American families with appropriate programs 
and activities, and I urge all the people of the United States to 
reaffirm their family ties and to share their family histories.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7254 of November 19, 1999

National Family Caregivers Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

During this season when we give thanks for the many blessings in our 
lives, let us take time to acknowledge the loving support of the 
millions of family caregivers across our country who provide for the 
needs of parents, spouses, and other loved ones who are no longer able 
to care for themselves. These remarkable individuals give their utmost 
to ensure that their relatives can remain in the comforting, familiar 
surroundings of their homes and communities.
Family caregivers embody the finest of American values. With compassion 
and a deep sense of responsibility, they devote their time and energy 
and often their own financial resources to care for family members in 
need. In many ways, family caregivers are mainstays in the provision of 
long-term care in our country. Today, more than 7 million Americans are 
informal caregivers who provide unpaid help to older persons, and 95 
percent of older Americans with limitations on their daily living 
activities depend on family members for some portion of their care. That 
number will continue to grow during the next three decades as our 
elderly population doubles, with the aging of 76 million baby boomers. 
Recognizing the important role family caregivers play in the lives of so 
many, we must continue to strongly support efforts to provide them with 
the assistance, information, and en

[[Page 141]]

couragement they need to fulfill their vital responsibilities to older 
family members, and to those who are chronically ill or disabled.
Millions of lives have been enriched by the hard work and generosity of 
family caregivers; many older, ill, or disabled Americans enjoy a 
greater measure of comfort, dignity, and independence thanks to the 
loving care of family members. During National Family Caregivers Week, 
let us honor the many devoted men and women whose efforts do so much to 
strengthen the bonds of family and community in our Nation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 21 through 
November 27, 1999, as National Family Caregivers Week. I call upon all 
Americans to pay tribute to and acknowledge the contributions of 
caregivers to the quality of our national life.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7255 of November 20, 1999

Thanksgiving Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Well over three and a half centuries ago, strengthened by faith and 
bound by a common desire for liberty, a small band of Pilgrims sought 
out a place in the New World where they could worship according to their 
own beliefs. Surviving their first harsh winter in Massachusetts and 
grateful to a merciful God for a sustaining harvest, the men and women 
of Plymouth Colony set aside three days as a time to give thanks for the 
bounty of their fields, the fruits of their labor, the chance to live in 
peace with their Native American neighbors, and the blessings of a land 
where they could live and worship freely.
We have come far on our American journey since that early Thanksgiving. 
In the intervening years, we have lived through times of war and peace, 
years of poverty and plenty, and seasons of social and political 
upheaval that have shaped and forever changed our national character and 
experience. As we gather around our Thanksgiving tables again this year, 
it is a fitting time to reflect on how the events of our rich history 
have affected those we care about and those who came before us. As we 
acknowledge the past, we do so knowing that the individual blessings for 
which we give thanks may have changed, but our gratitude to God and our 
commitment to our fellow Americans remain constant.
Today we count among our national blessings a time of unprecedented 
prosperity, with an expanding economy, record low rates of poverty and 
unemployment among our people, and the limitless opportunities to im

[[Page 142]]

prove the quality of life that new technologies present to us. We can 
give thanks today that for the first time in history, more than half the 
world's people live under governments of their own choosing. And we 
remain grateful for the peace and freedom America continues to enjoy 
thanks to the courage and patriotism of our men and women in uniform.
But the spirit of Thanksgiving requires more than just an 
acknowledgement of our blessings; it calls upon us to reach out and 
share those blessings with others. We must strive to fulfill the promise 
of the extraordinary era in which we live and enter the new century with 
a commitment to widen the circle of opportunity, break down the 
prejudices that alienate us from one another, and build an America of 
understanding and inclusion, strong in our diversity, responsible in our 
freedom, and generous in sharing our bounty with those in need.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 25, 
1999, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all the people of 
the United States to assemble in their homes, places of worship, or 
community centers to share the spirit of fellowship and prayer and to 
reinforce the ties of family and community; to express heartfelt thanks 
to God for the many blessings He has bestowed upon us; and to reach out 
in true gratitude and friendship to our brothers and sisters in the 
larger family of humankind.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7256 of November 29, 1999

World AIDS Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As this year draws to a close, the world looks with hope to a new 
century and a new millennium. But in that new century, we will still 
face a familiar and deadly enemy: HIV and AIDS. Already, more than 33 
million people around the world have been infected with HIV; by the year 
2005, that figure will likely soar to more than 100 million.
The theme of World AIDS Day this year is ``AIDS--End the Silence. 
Listen, Learn, Live!'' This simple message challenges us all to become 
better informed about this global pandemic and to serve as strong and 
vocal advocates for HIV/AIDS education, prevention, and care. When we 
fail to tell our children the truth about how HIV is transmitted, we put 
them at risk for infection. When we are silent about the need for 
compassionate care for the ill and dying, we allow too many of those 
infected with AIDS to spend their final days unloved and alone.

[[Page 143]]

Throughout my Presidency, I have strived to break the silence 
surrounding HIV/AIDS, and my Administration has worked hard to eradicate 
this devastating global threat. We can take heart that many people with 
HIV/AIDS today are living longer and more fulfilling lives and that new 
drugs are showing promising results in halting the progression of the 
disease. However, AIDS has exposed the tremendous gulf that exists 
between those who share in the prosperity of our global economy and 
those who do not. Of the millions of people around the world coping with 
HIV and AIDS, most are living in poverty, without access to new 
treatments or even the basic care that could increase the quality and 
length of their lives.
Nowhere is the impact of this disease more devastating than in Africa, 
where 13 million men, women, and children have already died of AIDS, and 
11,000 more are becoming infected each day. In response to this health 
catastrophe, this year my Administration sought and attained the 
largest-ever U.S. budget commitment to the global fight against AIDS. 
This increase of $100 million will more than double our support for AIDS 
awareness and prevention, home and community-based care, care of 
children orphaned by AIDS, and development of the infrastructure 
necessary to support these efforts. I invite other G-8 nations to join 
us, and I urge other foreign governments, corporate leaders, 
nongovernmental organizations, faith communities, foundations, AIDS 
organizations, and citizens around the globe to make their own 
contributions to the crusade against HIV/AIDS.
To fight HIV/AIDS on the home front, this year's budget includes a $73 
million increase in funding for HIV prevention activities; an increase 
of $183 million in the Ryan White CARE Act, which helps provide primary 
care and support for those living with HIV/AIDS; an additional $80 
million in funding to the Minority AIDS Initiative, which uses existing 
programs to reach African Americans, Latinos, and other racial and 
ethnic minorities disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS; and an 
estimated $300 million in additional funds for AIDS-related research at 
the National Institutes of Health. I have given high priority to the 
development of a vaccine for AIDS, and our scientists and researchers 
remain committed to developing a vaccine that works for all who need it.
Until they achieve that goal, we must work together to break the silence 
and increase dialogue; to fight the stigmatization and protect the 
rights of those living with HIV and AIDS; and to help those infected 
find the care and treatment they need. As we usher in a new century, we 
must pledge to stay the course in our crusade until the world is finally 
freed from the shadow of this devastating epidemic.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 1999, as World 
AIDS Day. I invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in 
reaffirming our commitment to defeating HIV and AIDS. I encourage every 
American to participate in appropriate commemorative programs and 
ceremonies in workplaces, houses of worship, and other community 
centers, to reach out to protect and educate our children, and to help 
and comfort all people who are living with HIV and AIDS.

[[Page 144]]

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7257 of November 30, 1999

National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Drivers who operate motor vehicles while under the influence of alcohol 
or drugs are one of our Nation's greatest public safety risks; those 
drivers take advantage of the privilege of driving without assuming the 
corresponding responsibility of driving safely. In 1996 alone, more than 
46 million Americans drove their cars within 2 hours of using drugs, 
alcohol, or both, causing death or injury to themselves and thousands of 
others each year.
Thanks to the grassroots activism of organizations such as Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving, greater public awareness of the dangers of 
impaired driving, and stronger laws and stricter enforcement, we have 
made progress in our efforts to keep drunk and drugged drivers off the 
road and reduce alcohol-related fatalities. Last year, the number of 
people killed in alcohol-related crashes reached a record low, and the 
number of young people killed in such accidents fell to the lowest rate 
ever recorded. But as anyone who has lost a loved one to an alcohol-
related crash will attest, one impaired driver on the road is one too 
many.
That is why safety continues to be my Administration's top 
transportation priority, and that is why we remain committed to 
eliminating drunk and drugged driving. Because research shows that the 
risk of a fatal car crash significantly increases when a driver's blood 
alcohol content (BAC) exceeds .08, I continue to challenge the Congress 
to enact a tough national standard of impaired driving at .08 BAC. In 
support of this goal, last July Vice President Gore announced incentive 
grants totaling $57 million to 17 States and the District of Columbia 
for lowering the legal threshold for drunk driving to .08 BAC. These 
grants make up part of the more than $500 million in Federal grants 
authorized under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, 
which I signed into law June 9, 1998, to offer States incentives to 
enact and enforce laws that make driving with .08 BAC or greater a drunk 
driving offense.
I am pleased that today, thanks to legislation I signed in 1995, every 
State in our Nation and the District of Columbia has enacted zero 
tolerance laws for underage drinking and driving. I urge leaders and 
policymakers at the State and local level to continue to focus resources 
and public attention on drunk- and drugged-driving prevention and 
enforcement programs. Using these three powerful tools--increased public 
awareness, stronger laws, and

[[Page 145]]

tougher enforcement--we can make our neighborhoods and highways safer 
and continue to reduce deaths and injuries.
In memory of the thousands of people who have lost their lives to 
alcohol- and drug-impaired driving, I ask that all motorists participate 
once again this year in a ``National Lights on for Life Day.'' By 
driving with car headlights illuminated on Friday, December 17, 1999, we 
will underscore the profound responsibility each of us has to drive free 
from the influence of alcohol or drugs.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1999 as National 
Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to 
recognize the dangers of impaired driving, to take responsibility for 
themselves and others around them, to prevent anyone under the influence 
of alcohol or drugs from getting behind the wheel, and to help teach our 
young people about the importance of safe driving.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of 
November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  


<R05>
Proclamation 7258 of December 6, 1999

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

President Carter once said, ``America did not invent human rights. In a 
very real sense, it's the other way around. Human rights invented 
America.'' Human rights have been an integral part of America's history 
since the birth of our Nation more than two centuries ago. Refusing to 
accept tyranny and oppression, our founders secured a better way of life 
with our Constitution and Bill of Rights. These revolutionary documents 
have continued to protect our cherished freedoms of religion, speech, 
press, and assembly and to preserve the principles of equality, liberty, 
and justice that lie at the heart of our national identity.
As Americans, we have always strived to advance these rights and values 
both at home and abroad, and just as our founders sought a brighter 
future for our Nation, we envision a better future for our world. One of 
our most powerful tools in realizing that vision has been the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, which the United Nations General Assembly 
approved in December of 1948. It is not surprising that this document, 
which owed so much to the courage, imagination, and leadership of 
Eleanor Roosevelt, reaffirms in tone, thought, and language our own 
great charters of freedom. To honor Mrs. Roosevelt's legacy, and to 
acknowledge those who follow

[[Page 146]]

her example of commitment to human rights around the world, last year we 
established the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights.
In the 51 years since the adoption of the Universal Declaration, the 
United Nations has developed numerous legal instruments that specify the 
rights and obligations contained in the document, and the international 
community has made encouraging progress toward improving human rights 
for people of all nations. Today, more individuals than ever before are 
living in representative democracies where they can exercise their right 
to freely choose their own government. The international community 
responded vigorously to halt ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and is helping 
the people of East Timor not only to achieve legal recognition of their 
independence but also to develop the institutions they need to thrive as 
an independent and secure state. But despite this heartening progress, 
there are still many regions of the world where human rights are daily 
denied and aspirations to freedom routinely crushed. Our work is still 
far from complete.
Rising to these challenges, we in the United States have strengthened 
our commitment to improving international human rights. To enable the 
world community to react more quickly to genocidal conditions, we have 
established a genocide early warning system. We continue to fund 
nongovernmental organizations that respond rapidly to human rights 
emergencies. And we have created an interagency working group to help 
implement the human rights treaties we have already ratified and to make 
recommendations on treaties we have yet to ratify.
We also continue to be a world leader in the fight to eliminate 
exploitative and abusive child labor. Last week, I signed the instrument 
of ratification of the International Labor Organization's Convention on 
the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor, declaring on behalf 
of the American people that we simply will not tolerate child slavery, 
the sale or trafficking of children, child prostitution or pornography, 
forced or compulsory child labor, and hazardous work that harms the 
health, safety, and morals of children. Through these and other 
initiatives, America continues to reaffirm both at home and across the 
globe our fundamental belief in human dignity and our unchanging 
reverence for human rights.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and 
laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1999, as 
Human Rights Day; December 15, 1999, as Bill of Rights Day; and the week 
beginning December 10, 1999, as Human Rights Week. I call upon the 
people of the United States to celebrate these observances with 
appropriate activities, ceremonies, and programs that demonstrate our 
national commitment to the Bill of Rights, the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, and promotion and protection of human rights for all 
people.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7259 of December 7, 1999

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Early on Sunday morning, December 7, 1941, the 130 vessels of the U.S. 
Pacific Fleet lay quiet and serene in Pearl Harbor. American sailors 
were preparing to raise colors, unaware that the worst naval disaster in 
American history was about to unfold. As the first wave of Japanese 
planes dropped torpedo bombs on the fleet, all eight battleships along 
with three destroyers and three light cruisers were hit. Two hours after 
the first Japanese bomber hit its target, 21 ships of the U.S. Pacific 
Fleet lay sunk or badly damaged. U.S. aircraft losses included 188 
planes destroyed and another 159 damaged. Before the bombing was over, 
some 3,500 Americans had been killed or injured. The sinking of the 
battleship USS ARIZONA remains the most recognized symbol of that tragic 
day. Of the ARIZONA's crew, 1,177 were killed, nearly half of all the 
deaths suffered at Pearl Harbor.
Time has not dimmed our memory of the ferocity of that attack 58 years 
ago or the pain of the losses we suffered. The assault brought shock and 
grief not only to the families and loved ones of those who were injured 
or lost their lives, but also to our entire country.
The attack on Pearl Harbor shook our Nation but strengthened our 
resolve. Two days later, in a Fireside Chat, President Roosevelt 
affirmed that resolve in explaining America's sudden thrust into World 
War II: ``We don't like it--we didn't want to get in it--but we are in 
it and we're going to fight it with everything we've got. We are going 
to win the war and we are going to win the peace that follows.'' Just as 
the American forces at Pearl Harbor responded to the attack with great 
courage, the United States responded with determination that this 
assault would not keep us from victory over the Axis powers. Union 
leaders agreed not to strike for the duration of the war as President 
Roosevelt garnered the support of our working men and women to increase 
war production and build our ``Arsenal of Democracy.'' Millions of 
American patriots joined the Armed Forces, willing to serve and 
sacrifice in the cause of freedom.
Rising from the destruction at Pearl Harbor, all but three of the ships 
sunk there were repaired and put back into service. Less than 4 years 
later, the Pacific Fleet sailed victoriously into Tokyo Bay. Today, the 
Battleship Missouri Memorial is docked on Pearl Harbor's Battleship Row, 
a fitting tribute to our triumph in World War II. It was Pearl Harbor 
that cemented the United States resolve to win the war, and it was 
aboard the ``Mighty Mo'' that the Japanese signed surrender documents in 
1945, and peace in the Pacific was finally realized.
Pearl Harbor is both a reminder of what can happen when we are 
unprepared and a call for continuing vigilance in defense of our Nation. 
The world has changed greatly since that dark day more than half a 
century ago, but our need to remain engaged is more crucial than ever. 
We must never forget the lessons of Pearl Harbor or the courage, 
determination, and indomitable spirit of that generation of Americans 
who recovered from a

[[Page 148]]

devastating defeat to win the ultimate victory for freedom, democracy, 
and peace.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, has designated December 7, 1999, as 
``National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.''
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 1999, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in honor of the 
Americans who served at Pearl Harbor. I also ask all Federal departments 
and agencies, organizations, and individuals to fly the flag of the 
United States at half-staff on this day in honor of those Americans who 
died as a result of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7260 of December 13, 1999

Bicentennial Commemoration of the Death of George
Washington

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Few individuals in history have had a more profound and lasting effect 
on a nation and its people than has George Washington. His character, 
convictions, and vision shaped our Republic in its crucial formative 
years and started us on the great American journey that continues to 
this day.
At every moment of challenge or peril in the early history of our 
Nation, George Washington emerged as a leader of uncommon wisdom and 
steadfast dedication to the ideals of service. A brilliant warrior, he 
held together a small, undisciplined army with the force of his 
personality and the trust he inspired in his men, ultimately leading 
them to victory in the American Revolution. When the Constitutional 
Convention began in Philadelphia in 1787, the delegates turned to George 
Washington to lead their efforts to create a Constitution for the 
American people. Elected unanimously to preside over the Convention, 
Washington helped to craft the blueprint for our democracy that has 
inspired freedom-loving peoples across the globe for more than 2 
centuries.
As the first President of the United States, George Washington used his 
power wisely and with restraint, recognizing that his actions would set 
enduring precedents and traditions for the leaders who would follow him. 
He set a steady course for our fledgling Nation, keeping us free from 
entanglement in foreign conflicts, laying the foundations for financial 
stability and economic prosperity, maintaining a strong defense to 
preserve our independence and security, and ensuring above all the 
protection of Americans' rights and freedoms. And, in relinquishing his 
office at the appointed time,

[[Page 149]]

he established by example the peaceful transition of power that has 
become the hallmark of our democracy.
Near midnight on December 14, 1799, America's great warrior, statesman, 
and leader took his final breath. His last words were, `` ' Tis well.'' 
Due in large part to the early guiding hand of George Washington, it has 
been well for our Nation ever since. Now, 200 years later, as America 
continues its journey into a new century, it is fitting that we 
acknowledge our enduring debt to this great man.
The Congress, by Senate Concurrent Resolution 83, has requested the 
President to proclaim December 14, 1999, as a day to commemorate the 
200th anniversary of the death of George Washington.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, by the authority vested in me as 
President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, 
do hereby proclaim December 14, 1999, as the Bicentennial Commemoration 
of the Death of George Washington. I call upon the people of the United 
States to mark this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, 
paying tribute to the life and achievements of George Washington and his 
contributions to our Nation. As a further mark of respect, I hereby 
order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff 
upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval 
stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the 
District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its 
Territories and possessions on Tuesday, December 14, 1999. I also direct 
that the flag shall be flown at half-staff on that day at all United 
States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities 
abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and 
stations.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Proclamation 7261 of December 16, 1999

55th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

By the winter of 1944, the United States and our Allies had turned the 
tide of the Second World War. Allied forces had liberated the Italian 
peninsula and were gaining ground in France and the Low Countries. In 
mid-December, in a desperate attempt to halt this steady advance, Adolf 
Hitler launched a furious and massive counteroffensive. On December 16, 
29 German divisions flooded the Allied line in the Ardennes Forest 
region of Belgium and Luxembourg. The Battle of the Bulge had begun.
Facing superior enemy numbers, rugged terrain, and bitter weather, the 
American troops at first fell back. But their determination to defeat 
the Nazis never wavered. For 6 weeks, U.S. soldiers responded to fierce 
Ger

[[Page 150]]

man offensives with equally determined counterattacks, refusing to 
succumb to the Nazi onslaught. The siege of Bastogne in Belgium remains 
an enduring symbol of their indomitable spirit. At that strategic 
crossroads, a small detachment of the 101st Airborne Division and other 
attached troops were encircled. When called upon to surrender by the 
much larger German force, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe dismissed 
the demand with his legendary one-word reply: ``Nuts.'' Against all 
odds, he and his men held firm during the siege until reinforcements 
arrived and helped halt the German offensive at a critical point in the 
Battle.
Inevitably, the spirit, toughness, valor, and resolve of the U.S. forces 
led to victory. By late January of 1945, the American and Allied 
counterattack had succeeded in pushing back the Nazi forces, eliminating 
the threat of further German offensives and ultimately sealing the fate 
of the Nazi regime. But this victory was costly. At the end of the 
Battle of the Bulge, some 19,000 Americans lay dead, and thousands more 
were wounded, captured, or missing in action.
Now, more than half a century later, we still stand in awe of the 
courage and sacrifice of the more than 600,000 U.S. soldiers and airmen 
who fought that epic battle. These seemingly ordinary Americans achieved 
extraordinary things. Leaving their homes, their families, and their 
civilian lives behind them, they stepped forward to wage a crusade for 
freedom. They laid the foundations of the peace and security we enjoy 
today and planted the seeds of democracy that now are bearing fruit 
throughout Europe. Many of these heroes and patriots have gone to their 
final rest; but their service, their sacrifice, and their achievements 
will live forever in the memories and hearts of their fellow Americans.
The Congress by House Joint Resolution 65, has authorized and requested 
the President to issue a proclamation honoring the veterans of the 
Battle of the Bulge.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim the period of December 16, 1999, to January 
25, 2000, as a time to commemorate the 55th anniversary of the Battle of 
the Bulge. I call upon the people of the United States to express our 
profound gratitude to the veterans of the Battle of the Bulge and to 
honor them with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 7262 of December 16, 1999

Wright Brothers Day, 1999

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

We stand at a rare moment in human history: the end of a century and the 
birth of a new millennium. The arrival of the 21st century presents all 
Americans with an opportunity to reflect on where we have been as a 
Nation and to dream about where we will go in the future. At the dawn of 
this century, Orville and Wilbur Wright found themselves poised at such 
a moment. Behind them lay years of painstaking effort and 
experimentation, trial and failure, in their pursuit of the dream of 
powered human flight. Ahead of them stretched the sands of Kitty Hawk in 
North Carolina and yet another attempt to fly in the aircraft they had 
built by hand. On December 17, 1903, for 12 seconds and 120 feet, they 
achieved their dream and forever changed the destiny of humankind.
That first brief flight showed that the sky was no longer a limit but a 
new horizon; it ignited new dreams in our people. Each succeeding 
generation of Americans, building on the Wright brothers' achievement 
and fired by the same vision, energy, and determination, has refined the 
science of flight, increased the range, efficiency, and safety of 
aircraft, and created a modern air transportation system and aviation 
industry that have energized our economy and helped transform the world 
into a truly global community.
And, while they could never have foreseen it, the Wright brothers also 
brought us to the threshold of space. A scant six decades after that 
first flight, Americans left the Earth's atmosphere and orbited our 
planet. By 1969, Neil Armstrong had left the first human footprint on 
the dusty surface of the Moon. Today's astronauts fly space shuttle 
missions that are helping us meet the challenge of global climate 
change, bringing the International Space Station closer to completion, 
and expanding our knowledge of Earth and the universe. Yet even now the 
Wright brothers' achievement continues to fire our dreams and beckons us 
to make new discoveries.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963 (77 Stat. 
402; 36 U.S.C. 169), has designated December 17 of each year as ``Wright 
Brothers Day'' and has authorized and requested the President to issue 
annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to 
observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
America, do hereby proclaim December 17, 1999, as Wright Brothers Day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of 
December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and 
of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and 
twenty-fourth.

Executive Order 13111 of January 12, 1999

Using Technology To Improve Training Opportunities for Federal 
Government Employees

Advances in technology and increased skills needs are changing the 
workplace at an ever increasing rate. These advances can make Federal 
employees more productive and provide improved service to our customers, 
the American taxpayers. We need to ensure that we continue to train 
Federal employees to take full advantage of these technological advances 
and to acquire the skills and learning needed to succeed in a changing 
workplace. A coordinated Federal effort is needed to provide flexible 
training opportunities to employees and to explore how Federal training 
programs, initiatives, and policies can better support lifelong learning 
through the use of learning technology.
To help us meet these goals, I am creating a task force on Federal 
training technology, directing Federal agencies to take certain steps to 
enhance employees' training opportunities through the use of training 
technology, and an advisory committee on the use of training technology, 
which also will explore options for financing the training and post-
secondary education needed to upgrade skills and gain new knowledge.
Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the 
Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), and in 
furtherance of the purposes of Chapter 41 of title 5, United States 
Code, the Government Employees Training Act of 1958 (Public Law 85-507), 
as amended, and Executive Order 11348, ``Providing for the Further 
Training of Government Employees,'' and in order to make effective use 
of technology to improve training opportunities for Federal Government 
employees, it is ordered as follows:
Section 1. Establishment of the President's Task Force on Federal 
Training Technology. (a) The ``President's Task Force on Federal 
Training Technology'' (Task Force) is established. The Task Force shall 
provide leadership regarding the effective use of technology in training 
and education; make training opportunities an integral part of 
continuing employment in the Federal Government; and facilitate the 
ongoing coordination of Federal activities concerning the use of 
technology in training. The Task Force shall consist of the heads of the 
following departments and agencies or their representatives: the 
Departments of State, the Treasury, Defense, Jus

[[Page 155]]

tice, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, 
Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, and Education; 
the Office of Personnel Management, General Services Administration, 
Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space and 
Administration, Small Business Administration, and Social Security 
Administration; a representative from the Small Agency Council; and 
representatives from other relevant agencies and related Federal 
councils, as determined by the Chair and Vice Chair of the Task Force.
    (b) Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each 
agency or council shall designate a senior official to serve as a 
representative to the Task Force. The representative shall report 
directly to the agency head or the President's Management Council member 
on the agency's or council's activities under this order.
    (c) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall 
be the Chair and the representative from the Department of Labor shall 
be the Vice Chair of the Task Force.
    (d) The Chair and Vice Chair shall appoint an Executive Director.
    (e) The Task Force member agencies shall provide any required 
staffing and funding, as appropriate.
Sec. 2. Duties of the Task Force. (a) Within 18 months of the date of 
this order, the Task Force shall develop and recommend to the President,

Federal Government employees. The policy should promote and integrate 
the effective use of training technologies to create affordable and 
convenient training opportunities to improve Federal employee 
performance. The Task Force shall seek the views of experts from 
industry, academia, and State and local governments as the Task Force 
proceeds, as appropriate. Specifically, the Task Force shall:
       (1) develop strategies to improve the efficiency and 
availability of training opportunities for Federal Government employees;
       (2) form partnerships among key Federal agencies, State and 
local governments, businesses, universities, and other appropriate 
entities to promote the development and use of high-quality training 
opportunities;
       (3) analyze the use of technology in existing training programs 
and policies of the Task Force member agencies to determine what

provide innovative training opportunities for Federal employees;
       (8) recommend changes that may be needed to existing procurement 
laws to further the objectives of this order and forward the 
recommendations to the Administrator of OFPP; and
    (b) develop options and recommendations for establishing a Federal 
Individual Training Account for each Federal worker for training 
relevant to his or her Federal employment. To the extent permitted by 
law, such accounts may be established with the funds allocated to the 
agency for employee training. Approval for training would be within the 
discretion of the individual employee's manager. Options and 
recommendations shall be reported no later than 6 months from the date 
of this order.
Sec. 3. Duties of All Federal Agencies. (a) Each Federal agency shall, 
to the extent permitted by law:
       (1) include as part of its annual budget process a set of goals 
to provide the highest quality and most efficient training opportunities

    (4) Department of Commerce;
    (5) Department of Labor;

    (13) Domestic Policy Council; and
    (14) United States Coast Guard.
The Secretary of Transportation shall select from among the Task Force 
members a Chair and Vice Chair for the Task Force.

[[Page 165]]

    (c) The members of the Task Force shall be officials or employees of 
the Federal Government.
Sec. 2. Functions. (a) The Task Force shall report to the President 
through the Secretary of Transportation, and shall provide advice and 
recommendations regarding the appropriate roles and missions for the 
United States Coast Guard through the Year 2020. While the Task Force 
will comprehensively review all Coast Guard roles and missions, it will 
give special attention to the deepwater missions, which are those that 
generally occur beyond 50 nautical miles from U.S. shores.
    (b) The Chair shall consult with the Secretary of Transportation, 
Commandant of the Coast Guard, and, as appropriate, other heads of 
departments and agencies. The Chair may invite experts to submit 
information to the Task Force and hold field briefings or visits.

Sec. 3. Methodology. (a) The Task Force will seek to identify and 
distinguish which Coast Guard roles, missions, and functions might be

current Coast Guard roles, missions, and functions might be better 
performed by private organizations (by contract or otherwise), public 
authorities, local or State governments, or other Federal agencies. The 
Task Force will provide explicit reasons for its recommendations.
    (b) The Task Force will establish explicit criteria for screening 
roles, missions, and functions to determine how and by whom they would 
be best performed.
    (c) For those roles, missions, and functions that the Task Force 
recommends be performed by the Coast Guard, the Task Force will advise 
as to how they might be performed most effectively and efficiently.
    (d) The Task Force will consider the impact on Coast Guard roles, 
missions, and functions of future prospects in various areas, including 
technology, demographics, the law of the sea, marine pollution, and 
national security.
    (e) The Task Force shall review each of the Coast Guard's law 
enforcement and national security missions and functions according to 
the methodology described in this section. However, in conducting that 
review, the Task Force shall assume that the Coast Guard will remain a 
law enforcement agency and an armed force of the United States.
Sec. 4. Administration. (a) The heads of executive departments and 
agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Task Force 
such information with respect to the roles and missions of the Coast 
Guard as it may require to carry out its functions.

and financially.
    (c) The Secretary of Transportation shall appoint a Staff Director 
for the Task Force.

[[Page 166]]

experience to include persons of experience in national security, 
military operations, foreign and domestic policy, international affairs, 
economic policy, environmental protection, and law enforcement. Staff 
members may include military members on active duty, Reserve members of 
any component, and Federal civilian employees.
Sec. 5. General. (a) The Task Force shall exist for a period of 6 months 
from its first meeting unless extended by the Secretary of 
Transportation and, at the conclusion, submit a written report as 
discussed in section 2 of this order.
    (b) The recommendations of the Task Force will be considered in 
determining the appropriate level of investment in the Coast Guard's 
Deepwater Capability Replacement Project, a system of cutters and 
aircraft with an integrated command, control, communications, and sensor 
infrastructure. The Task Force may provide an interim report for use in 
preparation of the Federal budget for Fiscal Year 2001.

Executive Order 13116 of March 31, 1999

Identification of Trade Expansion Priorities and Discriminatory 
Procurement Practices

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including title III of the Act of 
March 3, 1993, as amended (41 U.S.C. 10d), sections 141 and 301-310 of 
the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 2171, 2411-2420), 
title III of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, as amended (19 U.S.C. 
2511-2518), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to 
ensure that the trade policies of the United States advance, to the 
greatest extent possible, the export of the products and services of the 
United States and that trade policy resources are used efficiently, it 
is hereby ordered as follows:
Part I: Identification of Trade Expansion Priorities
Section 1. Identification and Annual Report. (a) Within 30 days of the 
submission of the National Trade Estimate Report required by section 
181(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2241(b)) for 1999, 2000, and 2001, the 
United States Trade Representative (Trade Representative) shall review 
United States trade expansion priorities and identify priority foreign 
country practices, the elimination of which is likely to have the most 
significant potential to increase United States exports, either directly 
or through the establishment of a beneficial precedent. The Trade 
Representative shall submit to the Committee on Finance of the Senate 
and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and 
shall publish in the Federal Register, a report on the priority foreign 
country practices identified.
    (b) In identifying priority foreign country practices under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Trade Representative shall take into 
account all relevant factors, including:

[[Page 167]]

(1)  the major barriers and trade distorting practices described in the National Trade Estimate Report;
(2)  the trade agreements to which a foreign country is a party and its compliance with those agreements;
(3)  the medium-term and long-term implications of foreign government procurement plans; and
(4)  the international competitive position and export potential of United States products and services.

    (c) The Trade Representative may include in the report, if 
appropriate, a description of the foreign country practices that may in 
the future warrant identification as priority foreign country practices. 
The Trade Representative also may include a statement about other 
foreign country practices that were not identified because they are 
already being addressed by provisions of United States trade law, 
existing bilateral trade agreements, or in trade negotiations with other 
countries and progress is being made toward their elimination.
Sec. 2. Resolution. Upon submission of the report required by paragraph 
(a) of section 1 of this part, the Trade Representative shall, with 
respect to any priority foreign country practice identified therein, 
engage the country concerned for the purpose of seeking a satisfactory 
resolution, for example, by obtaining compliance with a trade agreement 
or the elimination of the practice as quickly as possible, or, if this 
is not feasible, by providing for compensatory trade benefits.
Sec. 3. Initiation of Investigations. Within 90 days of the submission 
of the report required by paragraph (a) of section 1 of this part, the 
Trade Representative shall initiate under section 302(b)(1) of the Act 
(19 U.S.C. 2412(b)(1)) investigations with respect to all of the 
priority foreign country practices identified, unless during the 90-day 
period the Trade Representative determines that a satisfactory 
resolution of the matter to be investigated has been achieved.
Part II: Identification of Discriminatory Government Procurement
Practices
Section 1. Identification and Annual Report. (a) Within 30 days of the 
submission of the National Trade Estimate Report for 1999, 2000, and 
2001, the Trade Representative shall submit to the Committees on Finance 
and on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committees on Ways and 
Means and Government Reform and Oversight of the House of 
Representatives, and shall publish in the Federal Register, a report on 
the extent to which foreign countries discriminate against U.S. products 
or services in making government procurements.
    (b) In the report, the Trade Representative shall identify countries 
that:

(1)  are not in compliance with their obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government
      Procurement (the GPA), Chapter 10 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or other agreements
      relating to government procurement (procurement agreements) to which that country and the United States
      are parties; or

[[Page 168]]

(2)  maintain, in government procurement, a significant and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination
      against U.S. products or services that results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses and whose products
      or services are acquired in significant amounts by the United States Government.

Sec. 2. Considerations in Making Identifications. In making the 
identifications required by section 1 of this part, the Trade 
Representative shall: (a) consider the requirements of the GPA, NAFTA, 
or other procurement agreements, government procurement practices, and 
the effects of such practices on U.S. businesses as a basis for 
evaluating whether the procurement practices of foreign governments do 
not provide fair market opportunities for U.S. products or services;
    (b) take into account, among other factors, whether and to what 
extent countries that are parties to the GPA, NAFTA, or other 
procurement agreements, and other countries described in section 1 of 
this part:

(1)  use sole-sourcing or otherwise noncompetitive procedures for procurement that could have been conducted
      using competitive procedures;
(2)  conduct what normally would have been one procurement as two or more procurements, to decrease the
      anticipated contract values below the value threshold of the GPA, NAFTA, or other procurement agreements,
      or to make the procurement less attractive to U.S. businesses;
(3)  announce procurement opportunities with inadequate time intervals for U.S. businesses to submit bids; and
(4)  use specifications in such a way as to limit the ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements;
      and

    (c) consider information included in the National Trade Estimate 
Report, and any other additional criteria deemed appropriate, including, 
to the extent such information is available, the failure to apply 
transparent and competitive procedures or maintain and enforce effective 
prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt practices in connection with 
government procurement.
Sec. 3. Impact of Noncompliance and Denial of Comparable Treatment. The 
Trade Representative shall take into account, in identifying countries 
in the annual report and in any action required by this part, the 
relative impact of any noncompliance with the GPA, NAFTA, or other 
procurement agreements, or of other discrimination on U.S. commerce, and 
the extent to which such noncompliance or discrimination has impeded the 
ability of U.S. suppliers to participate in procurements on terms 
comparable to those available to suppliers of the country in question 
when seeking to sell goods or services to the United States Government.
Sec. 4. Resolution. Upon submission of the report required by section 1 
of this part, the Trade Representative shall engage any country 
identified therein for the purpose of seeking a satisfactory resolution, 
for example, by obtaining compliance with the GPA, NAFTA, or other 
procurement agreements or the elimination of the discriminatory 
procurement practices as quickly as possible, or, if this is not 
feasible, by providing for compensatory trade benefits.

[[Page 169]]

Sec. 5. Initiation of Investigations. (a) Within 90 days of the 
submission of the report required by section 1 of this part, the Trade 
Representative shall initiate under section 302(b)(1) of the Act (19 
U.S.C. 2412(b)(1)) investigations with respect to any practice that:

(1)  was the basis for the identification of a country under section 1; and
(2)  is not at that time the subject of any other investigation or action under title III, chapter 1, of the
      Act,

unless during the 90-day period the Trade Representative determines that 
a satisfactory resolution of the matter to be investigated has been 
achieved.
    (b) For investigations initiated under paragraph (a) of this section 
(other than an investigation involving the GPA or NAFTA), the Trade 
Representative shall apply the time limits and procedures in section 
304(a)(3) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(3)). The time limits in 
subsection 304(a)(3)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2414(a)(3)(B)) shall apply 
if the Trade Representative determines that:

(1)  complex or complicated issues are involved in the investigation that require additional time;
(2)  the foreign country involved in the investigation is making substantial progress in drafting or
      implementing legislative or administrative measures that will end the discriminatory procurement practice;
      or
(3)  such foreign country is undertaking enforcement measures to end the discriminatory procurement practice.

Part III: Direction
Section 1. Presidential Direction. The authorities delegated pursuant to 
this order shall be exercised subject to any subsequent direction by the 
President in a particular matter.
Sec. 2. Consultations and Advice. In developing the annual reports 
required by part I and part II of this order, the Trade Representative 
shall consult with executive agencies and seek information and advice 
from U.S. businesses in the United States and in the countries involved 
in the practices under consideration.

Executive Order 13123 of June 3, 1999

Greening the Government Through Efficient Energy Management

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the National Energy 
Conservation Policy Act (Public Law 95-619, 92 Stat. 3206, 42 U.S.C. 
8252 et seq.), as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) 
(Public Law 102-486, 106 Stat. 2776), and section 301 of title 3, United 
States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
PART 1--PREAMBLE
Section 101. Federal Leadership. The Federal Government, as the Nation's 
largest energy consumer, shall significantly improve its energy 
management in order to save taxpayer dollars and reduce emissions that 
contribute to air pollution and global climate change. With more than 
500,000 buildings, the Federal Government can lead the Nation in energy 
efficient building design, construction, and operation. As a major 
consumer that spends $200 billion annually on products and services, the 
Federal Government can promote energy efficiency, water conservation, 
and the use of renewable energy products, and help foster markets for 
emerging technologies. In encouraging effective energy management in the 
Federal Government, this order builds on work begun under EPACT and 
previous Executive orders.
PART 2--GOALS
Sec. 201. Greenhouse Gases Reduction Goal. Through life-cycle cost-
effective energy measures, each agency shall reduce its greenhouse gas 
emissions attributed to facility energy use by 30 percent by 2010 
compared to such emissions levels in 1990. In order to encourage optimal 
investment in energy improvements, agencies can count greenhouse gas 
reductions from improvements in nonfacility energy use toward this goal 
to the extent

[[Page 181]]

that these reductions are approved by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB).
Sec. 202. Energy Efficiency Improvement Goals. Through life-cycle cost-
effective measures, each agency shall reduce energy consumption per 
gross square foot of its facilities, excluding facilities covered in 
section 203 of this order, by 30 percent by 2005 and 35 percent by 2010 
relative to 1985. No facilities will be exempt from these goals unless 
they meet new criteria for exemptions, to be issued by the Department of 
Energy (DOE).
Sec. 203. Industrial and Laboratory Facilities. Through life-cycle cost-
effective measures, each agency shall reduce energy consumption per 
square foot, per unit of production, or per other unit as applicable by 
20 percent by 2005 and 25 percent by 2010 relative to 1990. No 
facilities will be exempt from these goals unless they meet new criteria 
for exemptions, as issued by DOE.
Sec. 204. Renewable Energy. Each agency shall strive to expand the use 
of renewable energy within its facilities and in its activities by 
implementing renewable energy projects and by purchasing electricity 
from renewable energy sources. In support of the Million Solar Roofs 
initiative, the Federal Government shall strive to install 2,000 solar 
energy systems at Federal facilities by the end of 2000, and 20,000 
solar energy systems at Federal facilities by 2010.
Sec. 205. Petroleum. Through life-cycle cost-effective measures, each 
agency shall reduce the use of petroleum within its facilities. Agencies 
may accomplish this reduction by switching to a less greenhouse gas-
intensive, nonpetroleum energy source, such as natural gas or renewable 
energy sources; by eliminating unnecessary fuel use; or by other 
appropriate methods. Where alternative fuels are not practical or life-
cycle cost-effective, agencies shall strive to improve the efficiency of 
their facilities.
Sec. 206. Source Energy. The Federal Government shall strive to reduce 
total energy use and associated greenhouse gas and other air emissions, 
as measured at the source. To that end, agencies shall undertake life-
cycle cost-effective projects in which source energy decreases, even if 
site energy use increases. In such cases, agencies will receive credit 
toward energy reduction goals through guidelines developed by DOE.
Sec. 207. Water Conservation. Through life-cycle cost-effective 
measures, agencies shall reduce water consumption and associated energy 
use in their facilities to reach the goals set under section 503(f) of 
this order. Where possible, water cost savings and associated energy 
cost savings shall be included in Energy-Savings Performance Contracts 
and other financing mechanisms.
PART 3--ORGANIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Sec. 301. Annual Budget Submission. Each agency's budget submission to 
OMB shall specifically request funding necessary to achieve the goals of 
this order. Budget submissions shall include the costs associated with: 
encouraging the use of, administering, and fulfilling agency 
responsibilities under Energy-Savings Performance Contracts, utility 
energy-efficiency service contracts, and other contractual platforms for 
achieving conservation goals; implementing life-cycle cost-effective 
measures; procuring life-cycle cost-effective products; and constructing 
sustainably designed new buildings, among other energy costs. OMB shall 
issue guidelines to assist agen

[[Page 182]]

cies in developing appropriate requests that support sound investments 
in energy improvements and energy-using products. OMB shall explore the 
feasibility of establishing a fund that agencies could draw on to 
finance exemplary energy management activities and investments with 
higher initial costs but lower life-cycle costs. Budget requests to OMB 
in support of this order must be within each agency's planning guidance 
level.
Sec. 302. Annual Implementation Plan. Each agency shall develop an 
annual implementation plan for fulfilling the requirements of this 
order. Such plans shall be included in the annual reports to the 
President under section 303 of this order.
Sec. 303. Annual Reports to the President. (a) Each agency shall measure 
and report its progress in meeting the goals and requirements of this 
order on an annual basis. Agencies shall follow reporting guidelines as 
developed under section 306(b) of this order. In order to minimize 
additional reporting requirements, the guidelines will clarify how the 
annual report to the President should build on each agency's annual 
Federal energy reports submitted to DOE and the Congress. Annual reports 
to the President are due on January 1 of each year beginning in the year 
2000.
    (b) Each agency's annual report to the President shall describe how 
the agency is using each of the strategies described in Part 4 of this 
order to help meet energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals. The annual 
report to the President shall explain why certain strategies, if any, 
have not been used. It shall also include a listing and explanation of 
exempt facilities.
Sec. 304. Designation of Senior Agency Official. Each agency shall 
designate a senior official, at the Assistant Secretary level or above, 
to be responsible for meeting the goals and requirements of this order, 
including preparing the annual report to the President. Such designation 
shall be reported by each Cabinet Secretary or agency head to the Deputy 
Director for Management of OMB within 30 days of the date of this order. 
Designated officials shall participate in the Interagency Energy Policy 
Committee, described in section 306(d) of this order. The Committee 
shall communicate its activities to all designated officials to assure 
proper coordination and achievement of the goals and requirements of 
this order.
Sec. 305. Designation of Agency Energy Teams. Within 90 days of the date 
of this order, each agency shall form a technical support team 
consisting of appropriate procurement, legal, budget, management, and 
technical representatives to expedite and encourage the agency's use of 
appropriations, Energy-Savings Performance Contracts, and other 
alternative financing mechanisms necessary to meet the goals and 
requirements of this order. Agency energy team activities shall be 
undertaken in collaboration with each agency's representative to the 
Interagency Energy Management Task Force, as described in section 306(e) 
of this order.
Sec. 306. Interagency Coordination. (a) Office of Management and Budget.

Sec. 308. Applicability. This order applies to all Federal departments 
and agencies. General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for 
working with agencies to meet the requirements of this order for those 
facilities for which GSA has delegated operations and maintenance 
authority. The Department of Defense (DOD) is subject to this order to 
the extent that it does not impair or adversely affect military 
operations and training (including tactical aircraft, ships, weapons 
systems, combat training, and border security).
PART 4--PROMOTING FEDERAL LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY
MANAGEMENT
Sec. 401. Life-Cycle Cost Analysis. Agencies shall use life-cycle cost 
analysis in making decisions about their investments in products, 
services, construction, and other projects to lower the Federal 
Government's costs and to reduce energy and water consumption. Where 
appropriate, agencies shall consider the life-cycle costs of 
combinations of projects, particularly to encourage bundling of energy 
efficiency projects with renewable energy projects. Agencies shall also 
retire inefficient equipment on an accelerated basis where replacement 
results in lower life-cycle costs. Agencies that minimize life-cycle 
costs with efficiency measures will be recognized in their scorecard 
evaluations.
Sec. 402. Facility Energy Audits. Agencies shall continue to conduct 
energy and water audits for approximately 10 percent of their facilities 
each year, either independently or through Energy-Savings Performance 
Contracts or utility energy-efficiency service contracts.
Sec. 403. Energy Management Strategies and Tools. Agencies shall use a 
variety of energy management strategies and tools, where life-cycle 
cost-effective, to meet the goals of this order. An agency's use of 
these strategies and tools shall be taken into account in assessing the 
agency's progress and formulating its scorecard.
    (a) Financing Mechanisms. Agencies shall maximize their use of 
available alternative financing contracting mechanisms, including 
Energy-Savings Performance Contracts and utility energy-efficiency 
service contracts, when life-cycle cost-effective, to reduce energy use 
and cost in their facilities and operations. Energy-Savings Performance 
Contracts, which are authorized under the National Energy Conservation 
Policy Act, as modified by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and utility 
energy-efficiency service contracts provide significant opportunities 
for making Federal facilities more energy efficient at no net cost to 
taxpayers.
    (b) ENERGY STAR<Register> and Other Energy Efficient Products.
      (1) Agencies shall select, where life-cycle cost-effective, ENERGY 
STAR<Register> and other energy efficient products when acquiring 
energy-using products. For product groups where ENERGY STAR<Register> 
labels are not yet available, agencies shall select products that are in 
the upper 25 percent of energy efficiency as designated by FEMP. The 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOE  shall expedite the 
process of  designating  products as ENERGY STAR<Register> and will 
merge their current efficiency rating procedures.
      (2) GSA and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), with assistance 
from EPA and DOE, shall create clear catalogue listings that designate 
these products in both print and electronic formats. In addition, GSA 
and DLA

[[Page 185]]

shall undertake pilot projects from selected energy-using products to 
show a ``second price tag'', which means an accounting of the operating 
and purchase costs of the item, in both printed and electronic 
catalogues and assess the impact of providing this information on 
Federal purchasing decisions.
      (3) Agencies shall incorporate energy efficient criteria 
consistent with ENERGY STAR<Register> and other FEMP-designated energy 
efficiency levels into all guide specifications and project 
specifications developed for new construction and renovation, as well as 
into product specification language developed for Basic Ordering 
Agreements, Blanket Purchasing Agreements, Government Wide Acquisition 
Contracts, and all other purchasing procedures.
      (4) DOE and OMB shall also explore the creation of financing 
agreements with private sector suppliers to provide private funding to 
offset higher up-front costs of efficient products. Within 9 months of 
the date of this order, DOE shall report back to the President's 
Management Council on the viability of such alternative financing 
options.
    (c) ENERGY STAR<Register> Buildings. Agencies shall strive to meet 
the ENERGY STAR<Register> Building criteria for energy performance and 
indoor environmental quality in their eligible facilities to the maximum 
extent practicable by the end of 2002. Agencies may use Energy-Savings 
Performance Contracts, utility energy-efficiency service contracts, or 
other means to conduct evaluations and make improvements to buildings in 
order to meet the criteria. Buildings that rank in the top 25 percent in 
energy efficiency relative to  comparable  commercial  and  Federal  
buildings  will  receive the ENERGY STAR<Register> building label. 
Agencies shall integrate this building rating tool into their general 
facility audits.
    (d) Sustainable Building Design. DOD and GSA, in consultation with 
DOE and EPA, shall develop sustainable design principles. Agencies shall 
apply such principles to the siting, design, and construction of new 
facilities. Agencies shall optimize life-cycle costs, pollution, and 
other environmental and energy costs associated with the construction, 
life-cycle operation, and decommissioning of the facility. Agencies 
shall consider using Energy-Savings Performance Contracts or utility 
energy-efficiency service contracts to aid them in constructing 
sustainably designed buildings.
    (e) Model Lease Provisions. Agencies entering into leases, including 
the renegotiation or extension of existing leases, shall incorporate 
lease provisions that encourage energy and water efficiency wherever 
life-cycle cost-effective. Build-to-suit lease solicitations shall 
contain criteria encouraging sustainable design and development, energy 
efficiency, and verification of building performance. Agencies shall 
include a preference for buildings having the ENERGY STAR<Register> 
building label in their selection criteria for acquiring leased 
buildings. In addition, all agencies shall encourage lessors to apply 
for the ENERGY STAR<Register> building label and to explore and 
implement projects that would reduce costs to the Federal Government, 
including projects carried out through the lessors' Energy-Savings 
Performance Contracts or utility energy-efficiency service contracts.
    (f) Industrial Facility Efficiency Improvements. Agencies shall 
explore efficiency opportunities in industrial facilities for steam 
systems, boiler operation, air compressor systems, industrial processes, 
and fuel switching, including cogeneration and other efficiency and 
renewable energy technologies.

[[Page 186]]

    (g) Highly Efficient Systems. Agencies shall implement district 
energy systems, and other highly efficient systems, in new construction 
or retrofit projects when life-cycle cost-effective. Agencies shall 
consider combined cooling, heat, and power when upgrading and assessing 
facility power needs and shall use combined cooling, heat, and power 
systems when life-cycle cost-effective. Agencies shall survey local 
natural resources to optimize use of available biomass, bioenergy, 
geothermal, or other naturally occurring energy sources.
    (h) Off-Grid Generation. Agencies shall use off-grid generation 
systems, including solar hot water, solar electric, solar outdoor 
lighting, small wind turbines, fuel cells, and other off-grid 
alternatives, where such systems are life-cycle cost-effective and offer 
benefits including energy efficiency, pollution prevention, source 
energy reductions, avoided infrastructure costs, or expedited service.
Sec. 404. Electricity Use. To advance the greenhouse gas and renewable 
energy goals of this order, and reduce source energy use, each agency 
shall strive to use electricity from clean, efficient, and renewable 
energy sources. An agency's efforts in purchasing electricity from 
efficient and renewable energy sources shall be taken into account in 
assessing the agency's progress and formulating its score card.
    (a) Competitive Power. Agencies shall take advantage of competitive 
opportunities in the electricity and natural gas markets to reduce costs 
and enhance services. Agencies are encouraged to aggregate demand across 
facilities or agencies to maximize their economic advantage.
    (b) Reduced Greenhouse Gas Intensity of Electric Power. When 
selecting electricity providers, agencies shall purchase electricity 
from sources that use high efficiency electric generating technologies 
when life-cycle cost-effective. Agencies shall consider the greenhouse 
gas intensity of the source of the electricity and strive to minimize 
the greenhouse gas intensity of purchased electricity.
    (c) Purchasing Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources.
      (1) Each agency shall evaluate its current use of electricity from 
renewable energy sources and report this level in its annual report to 
the President. Based on this review, each agency should adopt policies 
and pursue projects that increase the use of such electricity. Agencies 
should include provisions for the purchase of electricity from renewable 
energy sources as a component of their requests for bids whenever 
procuring electricity. Agencies may use savings from energy efficiency 
projects to pay additional incremental costs of electricity from 
renewable energy sources.
      (2) In evaluating opportunities to comply with this section, 
agencies should consider: my Administration's goal of tripling 
nonhydroelectric renewable energy capacity in the United States by 2010; 
the renewable portfolio standard specified in the restructuring 
guidelines for the State in which the facility is located; GSA's efforts 
to make electricity from renewable energy sources available to Federal 
electricity purchasers; and EPA's guidelines on crediting renewable 
energy power in implementation of Clean Air Act standards.
Sec. 405. Mobile Equipment. Each agency shall seek to improve the 
design, construction, and operation of its mobile equipment, and shall 
implement all life-cycle cost-effective energy efficiency measures that 
result in cost

[[Page 187]]

savings while improving mission performance. To the extent that such 
measures are life-cycle cost-effective, agencies shall consider enhanced 
use of alternative or renewable-based fuels.
Sec. 406. Management and Government Performance. Agencies shall use the 
following management strategies in meeting the goals of this order.
    (a) Awards. Agencies shall use employee incentive programs to reward 
exceptional performance in implementing this order.
    (b) Performance Evaluations. Agencies shall include successful 
implementation of provisions of this order in areas such as Energy-
Savings Performance Contracts, sustainable design, energy efficient 
procurement, energy efficiency, water conservation, and renewable energy 
projects in the position descriptions and performance evaluations of 
agency heads, members of the agency energy team, principal program 
managers, heads of field offices, facility managers, energy managers, 
and other appropriate employees.
    (c) Retention of Savings and Rebates. Agencies granted statutory 
authority to retain a portion of savings generated from efficient energy 
and water management are encouraged to permit the retention of the 
savings at the facility or site where the savings occur to provide 
greater incentive for that facility and its site managers to undertake 
more energy management initiatives, invest in renewable energy systems, 
and purchase electricity from renewable energy sources.
    (d) Training and Education. Agencies shall ensure that all 
appropriate personnel receive training for implementing this order.
      (1) DOE, DOD, and GSA shall provide relevant training or training 
materials for those programs that they make available to all Federal 
agencies relating to the energy management strategies contained in this

<R05>
Executive Order 13124 of June 4, 1999

Amending the Civil Service Rules Relating to Federal Employees With 
Psychiatric Disabilities

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 
of title 5, United States Code, and in order to give individuals with 
psychiatric disabilities the same hiring opportunities as persons with 
severe physical disabilities or mental retardation under the Civil 
Service Rules, and to permit individuals with psychiatric disabilities 
to obtain Civil Service competitive status, it is hereby ordered as 
follows:
Section 1. Policy.
    (a) It is the policy of the United States to assure equality of 
opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-
sufficiency for persons with disabilities. The Federal Government as an 
employer should serve as a model for the employment of persons with 
disabilities and utilize the full potential of these talented citizens.
    (b) The Civil Service Rules governing appointment of persons with 
psychiatric disabilities were adopted years ago when attitudes about 
mental illness were different than they are today, which led to stricter 
standards for hiring persons with psychiatric disabilities than for 
persons with mental retardation or severe physical disabilities. The 
Civil Service Rules provide that persons with mental retardation, severe 
physical disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities may be hired under 
excepted appointing authorities. While persons with mental retardation 
or severe physical disabilities may be appointed for more than 2 years 
and may convert to competitive status after completion of 2 years of 
satisfactory service in their excepted position, people with psychiatric 
disabilities may not.
    (c) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the President's 
Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities believe that the 
Federal Government could better benefit from the contributions of 
persons with psychiatric disabilities if they were given the same 
opportunities available to people with mental retardation or severe 
physical disabilities.
Sec. 2. Implementation.
    (a) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall, 
consistent with OPM authority, provide that persons with psychiatric 
disabilities are subject to the same hiring rules as persons with mental 
retardation or severe physical disabilities.
    (b) Civil Service Rule III (5 CFR Part 3) is amended by adding the 
following new paragraph to subsection (b) of section 3.1:
       ``(3) An employee with psychiatric disabilities who completes at 
least 2 years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the 
competitive service.''

[[Page 193]]

Sec. 3. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall 
prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to implement this order.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Prohibition of Acquisition of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured 
Child Labor

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to continue the 
executive branch's commitment to fighting abusive child labor practices, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section. 1. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States 
Government, consistent with the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1307, the 
Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201 et. seq., and the Walsh-Healey 
Public Contracts Act, 41 U.S.C. 35 et seq., that executive agencies 
shall take appropriate actions to enforce the laws prohibiting the 
manufacture or importation of goods, wares, articles, and merchandise 
mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced or 
indentured child labor.
Sec. 2. Publication of List. Within 120 days after the date of this 
order, the Department of Labor, in consultation and cooperation with the 
Department of the Treasury and the Department of State, shall publish in 
the Federal Register a list of products, identified by their country of 
origin, that those Departments have a reasonable basis to believe might 
have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child 
labor. The Department of Labor may conduct hearings to assist in the 
identification of those products.

[[Page 196]]

Sec. 3. Procurement Regulations. Within 120 days after the date of this 
order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall issue proposed

    (a) Required Solicitation Provisions. Each solicitation of offers 
for a contract for the procurement of a product included on the list 
published under section 2 of this order shall include the following 
provisions:
    (1) A provision that requires the contractor to certify to the 
contracting officer that the contractor or, in the case of an 
incorporated contractor, a responsible official of the contractor has 
made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child 
labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished 
under the contract and that, on the basis of those efforts, the 
contractor is unaware of any such use of child labor; and
    (2) A provision that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully in 
providing reasonable access to the contractor's records, documents, 
persons, or premises if reasonably requested by authorized officials of 
the contracting agency, the Department of the Treasury, or the 
Department of Justice, for the purpose of determining whether forced or 
indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any 
product furnished under the contract.
    (b) Investigations. Whenever a contracting officer of an executive 
agency has reason to believe that forced or indentured child labor was 
used to mine, produce, or manufacture a product furnished pursuant to a 
contract subject to the requirements of subsection 3(a) of this order, 
the head of the executive agency shall refer the matter for 
investigation to the Inspector General of the executive agency and, as 
the head of the executive agency or the Inspector General determines 
appropriate, to the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (c) Remedies.
    (1) The head of an executive agency may impose remedies as provided 
in this subsection in the case of a contractor under a contract of the 
executive agency if the head of the executive agency finds that the 
contractor:

(i)    Has furnished under the contract products that have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or
      indentured child labor or uses forced or indentured child labor in the mining, production, or
      manufacturing operations of the contractor;
(ii)    Has submitted a false certification under subsection 3(a)(1) of this order; or
(iii)    Has failed to cooperate in accordance with the obligation imposed pursuant to subsection 3(a)(2) of this
   order.

    (2) The head of an executive agency, in his or her sole discretion, 
may terminate a contract on the basis of any finding described in 
subsection 3(c)(1) of this order for any contract entered into after the 
date the regulation called for in section 3 of this order is published 
in final.
    (3) The head of an executive agency may debar or suspend a 
contractor from eligibility for Federal contracts on the basis of a 
finding that the contractor has engaged in an act described in 
subsection 3(c)(1) of this order. The provision for debarment may not 
exceed 3 years.

[[Page 197]]

    (4) The Administrator of General Services shall include on the List 
of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs 
(maintained by the Administrator as described in the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation) each party that is debarred, suspended, proposed for 
debarment or suspension, or declared ineligible by the head of an agency 
on the basis that the person has engaged in an act described in 
subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.
    (5) This section shall not be construed to limit the use of other 
remedies available to the head of an executive agency or any other 
official of the Federal Government on the basis of a finding described 
in subsection 3(c)(1) of this order.
Sec. 4. Report. Within 2 years after implementation of any final rule 
under this order, the Administrator of General Services, with the 
assistance of other executive agencies, shall submit to the Office of 
Management and Budget a report on the actions taken pursuant to this 
order.
Sec. 5. Scope. (a) Any proposed rules issued pursuant to section 3 of 
this order shall apply only to acquisitions for a total amount in excess 
of the micro-purchase threshold as defined in section 32(f) of the 
Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 428(f)).
    (b) This order does not apply to a contract that is for the 
procurement of any product, or any article, material, or supply 
contained in a product that is mined, produced, or manufactured in any 
foreign country if:

(1)   the foreign country is a party to the Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or
      a party to the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''); and
(2)   the contract is of a value that is equal to or greater than the United States threshold specified in the
      Agreement on Government Procurement annexed to the WTO Agreement or NAFTA, whichever is applicable.

Sec. 6. Definitions. (a) ``Executive agency'' and ``agency'' have the 
meaning given to ``executive agency'' in section 4(1) of the Office of 
Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403(1)).
    (b) ``WTO Agreement'' means the Agreement Establishing the World 
Trade Organization, entered into on April 15, 1994.
    (c) ``Forced or indentured child labor'' means all work or service 
(1) exacted from any person under the age of 18 under the menace of any 
penalty for its nonperformance and for which the worker does not offer 
himself voluntarily; or (2) performed by any person under the age of 18 
pursuant to a contract the enforcement of which can be accomplished by 
process or penalties.
Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order is intended only to improve the 
internal management of the executive branch and does not create any 
rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by a 
party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any 
other person.

right, benefit, trust, or responsibility, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its 
agencies, its officers, or any person.

Executive Order 13132 of August 4, 1999

Federalism

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to guarantee the 
division of governmental responsibilities between the national 
government and the States that was intended by the Framers of the 
Constitution, to ensure that the principles of federalism established by 
the Framers guide the executive departments and agencies in the 
formulation and implementation of policies, and to further the policies 
of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Definitions. For purposes of this order:
    (a) ``Policies that have federalism implications'' refers to 
regulations, legislative comments or proposed legislation, and other 
policy statements or actions that have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the 
States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government.
    (b) ``State'' or ``States'' refer to the States of the United States 
of America, individually or collectively, and, where relevant, to State 
governments, including units of local government and other political 
subdivisions established by the States.

[[Page 207]]

    (c) ``Agency'' means any authority of the United States that is an 
``agency'' under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be 
independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).
    (d) ``State and local officials'' means elected officials of State 
and local governments or their representative national organizations.
Sec. 2. Fundamental Federalism Principles. In formulating and 
implementing policies that have federalism implications, agencies shall 
be guided by the following fundamental federalism principles:
    (a) Federalism is rooted in the belief that issues that are not 
national in scope or significance are most appropriately addressed by 
the level of government closest to the people.
    (b) The people of the States created the national government and 
delegated to it enumerated governmental powers. All other sovereign 
powers, save those expressly prohibited the States by the Constitution, 
are reserved to the States or to the people.
    (c) The constitutional relationship among sovereign governments, 
State and national, is inherent in the very structure of the 
Constitution and is formalized in and protected by the Tenth Amendment 
to the Constitution.
    (d) The people of the States are free, subject only to restrictions 
in the Constitution itself or in constitutionally authorized Acts of 
Congress, to define the moral, political, and legal character of their 
lives.
    (e) The Framers recognized that the States possess unique 
authorities, qualities, and abilities to meet the needs of the people 
and should function as laboratories of democracy.
    (f) The nature of our constitutional system encourages a healthy 
diversity in the public policies adopted by the people of the several 
States according to their own conditions, needs, and desires. In the 
search for enlightened public policy, individual States and communities 
are free to experiment with a variety of approaches to public issues. 
One-size-fits-all approaches to public policy problems can inhibit the 
creation of effective solutions to those problems.
    (g) Acts of the national government--whether legislative, executive, 
or judicial in nature--that exceed the enumerated powers of that 
government under the Constitution violate the principle of federalism 
established by the Framers.
    (h) Policies of the national government should recognize the 
responsibility of--and should encourage opportunities for--individuals, 
families, neighborhoods, local governments, and private associations to 
achieve their personal, social, and economic objectives through 
cooperative effort.
    (i) The national government should be deferential to the States when 
taking action that affects the policymaking discretion of the States and 
should act only with the greatest caution where State or local 
governments have identified uncertainties regarding the constitutional 
or statutory authority of the national government.
Sec. 3. Federalism Policymaking Criteria. In addition to adhering to the 
fundamental federalism principles set forth in section 2, agencies shall 
adhere, to the extent permitted by law, to the following criteria when 
formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications:

[[Page 208]]

    (a) There shall be strict adherence to constitutional principles. 
Agencies shall closely examine the constitutional and statutory 
authority supporting any action that would limit the policymaking 
discretion of the States and shall carefully assess the necessity for 
such action. To the extent practicable, State and local officials shall 
be consulted before any such action is implemented. Executive Order 
12372 of July 14, 1982 (``Intergovernmental Review of Federal 
Programs'') remains in effect for the programs and activities to which 
it is applicable.
    (b) National action limiting the policymaking discretion of the 
States shall be taken only where there is constitutional and statutory 
authority for the action and the national activity is appropriate in 
light of the presence of a problem of national significance. Where there 
are significant uncertainties as to whether national action is 
authorized or appropriate, agencies shall consult with appropriate State 
and local officials to determine whether Federal objectives can be 
attained by other means.
    (c) With respect to Federal statutes and regulations administered by 
the States, the national government shall grant the States the maximum 
administrative discretion possible. Intrusive Federal oversight of State 
administration is neither necessary nor desirable.
    (d) When undertaking to formulate and implement policies that have 
federalism implications, agencies shall:
      (1) encourage States to develop their own policies to achieve 
program objectives and to work with appropriate officials in other 
States;
      (2) where possible, defer to the States to establish standards;
      (3) in determining whether to establish uniform national 
standards, consult with appropriate State and local officials as to the 
need for national standards and any alternatives that would limit the 
scope of national standards or otherwise preserve State prerogatives and 
authority; and
      (4) where national standards are required by Federal statutes, 
consult with appropriate State and local officials in developing those 
standards.
Sec. 4. Special Requirements for Preemption. Agencies, in taking action 
that preempts State law, shall act in strict accordance with governing 
law.
    (a) Agencies shall construe, in regulations and otherwise, a Federal 
statute to preempt State law only where the statute contains an express 
preemption provision or there is some other clear evidence that the 
Congress intended preemption of State law, or where the exercise of 
State authority conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority under 
the Federal statute.
    (b) Where a Federal statute does not preempt State law (as addressed 
in subsection (a) of this section), agencies shall construe any 
authorization in the statute for the issuance of regulations as 
authorizing preemption of State law by rulemaking only when the exercise 
of State authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal 
authority under the Federal statute or there is clear evidence to 
conclude that the Congress intended the agency to have the authority to 
preempt State law.
    (c) Any regulatory preemption of State law shall be restricted to 
the minimum level necessary to achieve the objectives of the statute 
pursuant to which the regulations are promulgated.

[[Page 209]]

    (d) When an agency foresees the possibility of a conflict between 
State law and Federally protected interests within its area of 
regulatory responsibility, the agency shall consult, to the extent 
practicable, with appropriate State and local officials in an effort to 
avoid such a conflict.
    (e) When an agency proposes to act through adjudication or 
rulemaking to preempt State law, the agency shall provide all affected 
State and local officials notice and an opportunity for appropriate 
participation in the proceedings.
Sec. 5. Special Requirements for Legislative Proposals. Agencies shall 
not submit to the Congress legislation that would:
    (a) directly regulate the States in ways that would either interfere 
with functions essential to the States' separate and independent 
existence or be inconsistent with the fundamental federalism principles 
in section 2;
    (b) attach to Federal grants conditions that are not reasonably 
related to the purpose of the grant; or
    (c) preempt State law, unless preemption is consistent with the 
fundamental federalism principles set forth in section 2, and unless a 
clearly legitimate national purpose, consistent with the federalism 
policymaking criteria set forth in section 3, cannot otherwise be met.
Sec. 6. Consultation.
    (a) Each agency shall have an accountable process to ensure 
meaningful and timely input by State and local officials in the 
development of regulatory policies that have federalism implications. 
Within 90 days after the effective date of this order, the head of each 
agency shall designate an official with principal responsibility for the 
agency's implementation of this order and that designated official shall 
submit to the Office of Management and Budget a description of the 
agency's consultation process.
    (b) To the extent practicable and permitted by law, no agency shall 
promulgate any regulation that has federalism implications, that imposes 
substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments, and 
that is not required by statute, unless:
      (1) funds necessary to pay the direct costs incurred by the State 
and local governments in complying with the regulation are provided by 
the Federal Government; or
      (2) the agency, prior to the formal promulgation of the 
regulation,

  (A) consulted with State and local officials early in the 
process of developing the proposed regulation;
  (B) in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the 
regulation as it is to be issued in the Federal Register, provides 
to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget a 
federalism summary impact statement, which consists of a 
description of the extent of the agency's prior consultation with 
State and local officials, a summary of the nature of their 
concerns and the agency's position supporting the need to issue 
the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the 
concerns of State and local officials have been met; and

  (C) makes available to the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget any written communications submitted to the agency by 
State and local officials.


[[Page 210]]


    (c) To the extent practicable and permitted by law, no agency shall 
promulgate any regulation that has federalism implications and that 
preempts State law, unless the agency, prior to the formal promulgation 
of the regulation,
      (1) consulted with State and local officials early in the process 
of developing the proposed regulation;
      (2) in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the 
regulation as it is to be issued in the Federal Register, provides to 
the Director of the Office of Management and Budget a federalism summary 
impact statement, which consists of a description of the extent of the 
agency's prior consultation with State and local officials, a summary of 
the nature of their concerns and the agency's position supporting the 
need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the 
concerns of State and local officials have been met; and
      (3) makes available to the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget any written communications submitted to the agency by State 
and local officials.
Sec. 7. Increasing Flexibility for State and Local Waivers.
    (a) Agencies shall review the processes under which State and local 
governments apply for waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements 
and take appropriate steps to streamline those processes.
    (b) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by 
law, consider any application by a State for a waiver of statutory or 
regulatory requirements in connection with any program administered by 
that agency with a general view toward increasing opportunities for 
utilizing flexible policy approaches at the State or local level in 
cases in which the proposed waiver is consistent with applicable Federal 
policy objectives and is otherwise appropriate.
    (c) Each agency shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by 
law, render a decision upon a complete application for a waiver within 
120 days of receipt of such application by the agency. If the 
application for a waiver is not granted, the agency shall provide the 
applicant with timely written notice of the decision and the reasons 
therefor.
    (d) This section applies only to statutory or regulatory 
requirements that are discretionary and subject to waiver by the agency.
Sec. 8. Accountability.
    (a) In transmitting any draft final regulation that has federalism 
implications to the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to 
Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, each agency shall include a 
certification from the official designated to ensure compliance with 
this order stating that the requirements of this order have been met in 
a meaningful and timely manner.
    (b) In transmitting proposed legislation that has federalism 
implications to the Office of Management and Budget, each agency shall 
include a certification from the official designated to ensure 
compliance with this order that all relevant requirements of this order 
have been met.
    (c) Within 180 days after the effective date of this order, the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Assistant to the 
President

[[Page 211]]

for Intergovernmental Affairs shall confer with State and local 
officials to ensure that this order is being properly and effectively 
implemented.
Sec. 9. Independent Agencies. Independent regulatory agencies are 
encouraged to comply with the provisions of this order.
Sec. 10. General Provisions.
    (a) This order shall supplement but not supersede the requirements 
contained in Executive Order 12372 (``Intergovernmental Review of 
Federal Programs''), Executive Order 12866 (``Regulatory Planning and 
Review''), Executive Order 12988 (``Civil Justice Reform''), and OMB

Executive Order 13134 of August 12, 1999

Developing and Promoting Biobased Products and Bioenergy

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), and in order to stimulate the 
creation and early adoption of technologies needed to make biobased 
products and bioenergy cost-competitive in large national and 
international markets, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Current biobased product and bioenergy technology has 
the potential to make renewable farm and forestry resources major 
sources of affordable electricity, fuel, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and 
other materials. Technical advances in these areas can create an 
expanding array of exciting new business and employment opportunities 
for farmers, foresters,

[[Page 213]]

ranchers, and other businesses in rural America. These technologies can 
create new markets for farm and forest waste products, new economic 
opportunities for underused land, and new value-added business 
opportunities. They also have the potential to reduce our Nation's 
dependence on foreign oil, improve air quality, water quality, and flood 
control, decrease erosion, and help minimize net production of 
greenhouse gases. It is the policy of this Administration, therefore, to 
develop a comprehensive national strategy, including research, 
development, and private sector incentives, to stimulate the creation 
and early adoption of technologies needed to make biobased products and 
bioenergy cost-competitive in large national and international markets.
Sec. 2. Establishment of the Interagency Council on Biobased Products 
and Bioenergy. (a) There is established the Interagency Council on 
Biobased Products and Bioenergy (the ``Council''). The Council shall be 
composed of the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, and the 
Interior, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Assistant to the 
President for Science and Technology, the Director of the National 
Science Foundation, the Federal Environmental Executive, and the heads 
of other relevant agencies as may be determined by the Co-Chairs of the 
Council. Members may serve on the Council through designees. Designees 
shall be senior officials who report directly to the agency head 
(Assistant Secretary or equivalent).
    (b) The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy shall 
serve as Co-Chairs of the Council.
    (c) The Council shall prepare annually a strategic plan for the 
President outlining overall national goals in the development and use of 
biobased products and bioenergy in an environmentally sound manner and 
how these goals can best be achieved through Federal programs and 
integrated planning. The goals shall include promoting national economic 
growth with specific attention to rural economic interests, energy 
security, and environmental sustainability and protection. These 
strategic plans shall be compatible with the national goal of producing 
safe and affordable supplies of food, feed, and fiber in a way that is 
sustainable and protects the environment, and shall include measurable 
objectives. Specifically, these strategic plans shall cover the 
following areas:
    (1) biobased products, including commercial and industrial 
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, products with large carbon sequestering 
capacity, and other materials; and
    (2) biomass used in the production of energy (electricity; liquid, 
solid, and gaseous fuels; and heat).
    (d) To ensure that the United States takes full advantage of the 
potential economic and environmental benefits of bioenergy, these 
strategic plans shall be based on analyses of: (1) the economic impacts 
of expanded biomass production and use; and (2) the impacts on national 
environmental objectives, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Specifically, these plans shall include:
    (1) a description of priorities for research, development, 
demonstration, and other investments in biobased products and bioenergy;
    (2) a coordinated Federal program of research, building on the 
research budgets of each participating agency; and

[[Page 214]]

    (3) proposals for using existing agency authorities to encourage 
the adoption and use of biobased products and bioenergy and recommended 
legislation for modifying these authorities or creating new authorities 
if needed.
    (e) The first annual strategic plan shall be submitted to the 
President within 8 months from the date of this order.
    (f) The Council shall coordinate its activities with actions called 
for in all relevant Executive orders and shall not be in conflict with 
proposals advocated by other Executive orders.
Sec. 3. Establishment of Advisory Committee on Biobased Products and 
Bioenergy. (a) The Secretary of Energy shall establish an ``Advisory 
Committee on Biobased Products and Bioenergy'' (``Committee''), under 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), to 
provide information and advice for consideration by the Council. The 
Secretary of Energy shall, in consultation with other members of the 
Council, appoint up to 20 members of the advisory committee representing 
stakeholders including representatives from the farm, forestry, chemical 
manufacturing and other businesses, energy companies, electric 
utilities, environmental organizations, conservation organizations, the 
university research community, and other critical sectors. The Secretary 
of Energy shall designate Co-Chairs from among the members of the 
Committee.
    (b) Among other things, the Committee shall provide the Council with 
an independent assessment of:
    (1) the goals established by the Federal agencies for developing 
and promoting biobased products and bioenergy;
    (2) the balance of proposed research and development activities;
    (3) the effectiveness of programs designed to encourage adoption 
and use of biobased products and bioenergy; and
    (4) the environmental and economic consequences of biobased 
products and bioenergy use.
Sec. 4. Administration of the Advisory Committee. (a) To the extent 
permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the 
Department of Energy shall serve as the secretariat for, and provide the 
financial and administrative support to, the Committee.
    (b) The heads of agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, 
provide to the Committee such information as it may reasonably require 
for the purpose of carrying out its functions.
    (c) The Committee Co-Chairs may, from time to time, invite experts 
to submit information to the Committee and may form subcommittees or 
working groups within the Committee to review specific issues.
Sec. 5. Duties of the Departments of Agriculture and Energy. The 
Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture and Energy, to the extent 
permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, 
shall each establish a working group on biobased products and biobased 
activities in their respective Departments. Consistent with the Federal 
biobased products and bioenergy strategic plans described in sections 
2(c) and (d) of this order, the working groups shall:

[[Page 215]]

    (1) provide strategic planning and policy advice on the 
Department's research, development, and commercialization of biobased 
products and bioenergy; and
    (2) identify research activities and demonstration projects to 
address new opportunities in the areas of biomass production, biobased 
product and bioenergy production, and related fundamental research.
    The chair of each Department's working group shall be a senior 
official who reports directly to the agency head. If the Secretary of 
Agriculture or Energy serves on the Interagency Council on Biobased 
Products and Bioenergy through a designee, the designee should be the 
chair of the Department's working group.

Executive Order 13139 of September 30, 1999

Improving Health Protection of Military Personnel Participating in 
Particular Military Operations

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including section 1107 of title 
10, United States Code, and in order to provide the best health 
protection to military personnel participating in particular military 
operations, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Military personnel deployed in particular military 
operations could potentially be exposed to a range of chemical, 
biological, and radiological weapons as well as diseases endemic to an 
area of operations. It is the policy of the United States Government to 
provide our military personnel with safe and effective vaccines, 
antidotes, and treatments that will negate or minimize the effects of 
these health threats.
Sec. 2. Administration of Investigational New Drugs to Members of the 
Armed Forces.
    (a) The Secretary of Defense (Secretary) shall collect intelligence 
on potential health threats that might be encountered in an area of 
operations. The Secretary shall work together with the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to ensure appropriate countermeasures are 
developed. When the Secretary considers an investigational new drug or a 
drug unapproved for its intended use (investigational drug) to represent 
the most appropriate countermeasure, it shall be studied through 
scientifically based research and development protocols to determine 
whether it is safe and effective for its intended use.
    (b) It is the expectation that the United States Government will 
administer products approved for their intended use by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). However, in the event that the Secretary considers 
a product to represent the most appropriate countermeasure for diseases 
endemic to the area of operations or to protect against possible 
chemical, biological, or radiological weapons, but the product has not 
yet been approved by the FDA for its intended use, the product may, 
under certain circumstances and strict controls, be administered to 
provide potential protection for the health and well-being of deployed 
military personnel in order to ensure the success of the military 
operation. The provisions of 21 CFR Part 312 contain the FDA 
requirements for investigational new drugs.
Sec. 3. Informed Consent Requirements and Waiver Provisions.
    (a) Before administering an investigational drug to members of the 
Armed Forces, the Department of Defense (DoD) must obtain informed 
consent from each individual unless the Secretary can justify to the 
President a need for a waiver of informed consent in accordance with 10 
U.S.C. 1107(f). Waivers of informed consent will be granted only when 
absolutely necessary.
    (b) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1107(f), the President may waive 
the informed consent requirement for the administration of an 
investigational drug to a member of the Armed Forces in connection with 
the member's participation in a particular military operation, upon a 
written determination by the President that obtaining consent:

[[Page 222]]

    (1) is not feasible;
    (2) is contrary to the best interests of the member; or
    (3) is not in the interests of national security.
    (c) In making a determination to waive the informed consent 
requirement on a ground described in subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this 
section, the President is required by law to apply the standards and 
criteria set forth in the relevant FDA regulations, 21 CFR 50.23(d). In 
determining a waiver based on subsection (b)(3) of this section, the 
President will also consider the standards and criteria of the relevant 
FDA regulations.
    (d) The Secretary may request that the President waive the informed 
consent requirement with respect to the administration of an 
investigational drug. The Secretary may not delegate the authority to 
make this waiver request. At a minimum, the waiver request shall 
contain:
    (1) A full description of the threat, including the potential for 
exposure. If the threat is a chemical, biological, or radiological 
weapon, the waiver request shall contain an analysis of the probability 
the weapon will be used, the method or methods of delivery, and the 
likely magnitude of its affect on an exposed individual.
    (2) Documentation that the Secretary has complied with 21 CFR 
50.23(d). This documentation shall include:

(A) A statement that certifies and a written justification that 
documents that each of the criteria and standards set forth in 21 
CFR 50.23(d) has been met; or

(B) If the Secretary finds it highly impracticable to certify 
that the criteria and standards set forth in 21 CFR 50.23(d) have 
been fully met because doing so would significantly impair the 
Secretary's ability to carry out the particular military mission, 
a written justification that documents which criteria and 
standards have or have not been met, explains the reasons for 
failing to meet any of the criteria and standards, and provides 
additional justification why a waiver should be granted solely in 
the interests of national security.

    (3) Any additional information pertinent to the Secretary's 
determination, including the minutes of the Institutional Review Board's 
(IRB) deliberations and the IRB members' voting record.
    (e) The Secretary shall develop the waiver request in consultation 
with the FDA.
    (f) The Secretary shall submit the waiver request to the President 
and provide a copy to the Commissioner of the FDA (Commissioner).
    (g) The Commissioner shall expeditiously review the waiver request 
and certify to the Assistant to the President for National Security 
Affairs (APNSA) and the Assistant to the President for Science and 
Technology (APST) whether the standards and criteria of the relevant FDA 
regulations have been adequately addressed and whether the 
investigational new drug protocol may proceed subject to a decision by 
the President on the informed consent waiver request. FDA shall base its 
decision on, and the certification shall include an analysis describing, 
the extent and strength of the evidence on the safety and effectiveness 
of the investigational new drug

[[Page 223]]

in relation to the medical risk that could be encountered during the 
military operation.
    (h) The APNSA and APST will prepare a joint advisory opinion as to 
whether the waiver of informed consent should be granted and will 
forward it, along with the waiver request and the FDA certification to 
the President.
    (i) The President will approve or deny the waiver request and will 
provide written notification of the decision to the Secretary and the 
Commissioner.
Sec. 4. Required Action After Waiver is Issued. (a) Following a 
Presidential waiver under 10 U.S.C. 1107(f), the DoD offices responsible 
for implementing the waiver, DoD's Office of the Inspector General, and 
the FDA, consistent with its regulatory role, will conduct an ongoing 
review and monitoring to assess adherence to the standards and criteria 
under 21 CFR 50.23(d) and this order. The responsible DoD offices shall 
also adhere to any periodic reporting requirements specified by the 
President at the time of the waiver approval. The Secretary shall submit 
the findings to the President and provide a copy to the Commissioner.
    (b) The Secretary shall, as soon as practicable, make the 
congressional notifications required by 10 U.S.C. 1107(f)(2)(B).
    (c) The Secretary shall, as soon as practicable and consistent with 
classification requirements, issue a public notice in the Federal 
Register describing each waiver of informed consent determination and a 
summary of the most updated scientific information on the products used, 
as well as other information the President determines is appropriate.
    (d) The waiver will expire at the end of 1 year (or an alternative 
time period not to exceed 1 year, specified by the President at the time 
of approval), or when the Secretary informs the President that the 
particular military operation creating the need for the use of the 
investigational drug has ended, whichever is earlier. The President may 
revoke the waiver based on changed circumstances or for any other 
reason. If the Secretary seeks to renew a waiver prior to its 
expiration, the Secretary must submit to the President an updated 
request, specifically identifying any new information available relevant 
to the standards and criteria under 21 CFR 50.23(d). To request to renew 
a waiver, the Secretary must satisfy the criteria for a waiver as 
described in section 3 of this order.
    (e) The Secretary shall notify the President and the Commissioner if 
the threat countered by the investigational drug changes significantly 
or if significant new information on the investigational drug is 
received.
Sec. 5. Training for Military Personnel. (a) The DoD shall provide 
ongoing training and health risk communication on the requirements of 
using an investigational drug in support of a military operation to all 
military personnel, including those in leadership positions, during 
chemical and biological warfare defense training and other training, as 
appropriate. This ongoing training and health risk communication shall 
include general information about 10 U.S.C. 1107 and 21 CFR 50.23(d).
    (b) If the President grants a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 1107(f), the 
DoD shall provide training to all military personnel conducting the 
waiver protocol and health risk communication to all military personnel 
receiving the specific investigational drug to be administered prior to 
its use.

[[Page 224]]

    (c) The Secretary shall submit the training and health risk 
communication plans as part of the investigational new drug protocol 
submission to the FDA and the reviewing IRB. Training and health risk 
communication shall include at a minimum:
    (1) The basis for any determination by the President that informed 
consent is not or may not be feasible;
    (2) The means for tracking use and adverse effects of the 
investigational drug;
    (3) The benefits and risks of using the investigational drug; and
    (4) A statement that the investigational drug is not approved (or 
not approved for the intended use).
    (d) The DoD shall keep operational commanders informed of the 
overall requirements of successful protocol execution and their role, 
with the support of medical personnel, in ensuring successful execution 
of the protocol.
Sec. 6. Scope. (a) This order applies to the consideration and 
Presidential approval of a waiver of informed consent under 10 U.S.C. 
1107 and does not apply to other FDA regulations.
    (b) This order is intended only to improve the internal management 
of the Federal Government. Nothing contained in this order shall create 
any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any 
party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its 
officers or employees, or any other person.

Executive Order 13140 of October 6, 1999

1999 Amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial,
United States

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, including chapter 47 of title 10, 
United States Code (Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. 801-
946), in order to prescribe amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, 
United States, prescribed by Executive Order 12473, as amended by 
Executive Order 12484, Executive Order 12550, Executive Order 12586, 
Executive Order 12708, Executive Order 12767, Executive Order 12888, 
Executive Order 12936, Executive Order 12960, and Executive Order 13086, 
it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Part II of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, is 
amended as follows:
    a. R.C.M. 502(c) is amended to read as follows:

``(c) Qualifications of military judge. A military judge shall be 
a commissioned officer of the armed forces who is a member of the 
bar of a Federal court or a member of the bar of the highest court 
of a State

[[Page 225]]

and who is certified to be qualified for duty as a military judge 
by the Judge Advocate General of the armed force of which such 
military judge is a member. In addition, the military judge of a 
general court-martial shall be designated for such duties by the 
Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate General's designee, 
certified to be qualified for duty as a military judge of a 
general court-martial, and assigned and directly responsible to 
the Judge Advocate General or the Judge Advocate General's 
designee. The Secretary concerned may prescribe additional 
qualifications for military judges in special courts-martial. As 
used in this subsection ``military judge'' does not include the 
president of a special court-martial without a military judge.''

    b. R.C.M. 804 is amended by redesignating the current subsection (c) 
as subsection (d) and inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
subsection (c):

``(c) Voluntary absence for limited purpose of child testimony.

  (1) Election by accused. Following a determination by the 
military judge that remote live testimony of a child is 
appropriate pursuant to Mil. R. Evid. 611(d)(3), the accused may 
elect to voluntarily absent himself from the courtroom in order to 
preclude the use of procedures described in R.C.M. 914A.

  (2) Procedure. The accused's absence will be conditional upon 
his being able to view the witness' testimony from a remote 
location. Normally, a two-way closed circuit television system 
will be used to transmit the child's testimony from the courtroom 
to the accused's location. A one-way closed circuit television 
system may be used if deemed necessary by the military judge. The 
accused will also be provided private, contemporaneous 
communication with his counsel. The procedures described herein 
shall be employed unless the accused has made a knowing and 
affirmative waiver of these procedures.

  (3) Effect on accused's rights generally. An election by the 
accused to be absent pursuant to subsection (c)(1) shall not 
otherwise affect the accused's right to be present at the 
remainder of the trial in accordance with this rule.''

    c. The following new rule is inserted after R.C.M. 914:

``Rule 914A. Use of remote live testimony of a child

(a) General procedures. A child shall be allowed to testify out 
of the presence of the accused after the military judge has 
determined that the requirements of Mil. R. Evid. 611(d)(3) have 
been satisfied. The procedure used to take such testimony will be 
determined by the military judge based upon the exigencies of the 
situation. However, such testimony should normally be taken via a 
two-way closed circuit television system. At a minimum, the 
following procedures shall be observed:

  (1) The witness shall testify from a remote location outside 
the courtroom;

  (2) Attendance at the remote location shall be limited to the 
child, counsel for each side (not including an accused pro se), 
equipment operators, and other persons, such as an attendant for 
the child, whose presence is deemed necessary by the military 
judge;


[[Page 226]]


  (3) Sufficient monitors shall be placed in the courtroom to 
allow viewing and hearing of the testimony by the military judge, 
the accused, the members, the court reporter and the public;

  (4) The voice of the military judge shall be transmitted into 
the remote location to allow control of the proceedings; and

  (5) The accused shall be permitted private, contemporaneous 
communication with his counsel.

(b) Prohibitions. The procedures described above shall not be 
used where the accused elects to absent himself from the courtroom 
pursuant to R.C.M. 804(c).''

    d. R.C.M. 1001(b)(4) is amended by inserting the following sentences 
between the first and second sentences:

``Evidence in aggravation includes, but is not limited to, 
evidence of financial, social, psychological, and medical impact 
on or cost to any person or entity who was the victim of an 
offense committed by the accused and evidence of significant 
adverse impact on the mission, discipline, or efficiency of the 
command directly and immediately resulting from the accused's 
offense. In addition, evidence in aggravation may include evidence 
that the accused intentionally selected any victim or any property 
as the object of the offense because of the actual or perceived 
race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, 
disability, or sexual orientation of any person.''

    e. R.C.M. 1003(b) is amended--

  (1) by striking subsection (4) and

  (2) by redesignating subsections (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), 
and (11) as subsections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), and (10), 
respectively.

    f. R.C.M. 1004(c)(7) is amended by adding at end the following new 
subsection:

``(K) The victim of the murder was under 15 years of age.''

Sec. 2. Part III of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, is 
amended as follows:
    a. Insert the following new rule after Mil. R. Evid. 512:

``Rule 513. Psychotherapist-patient privilege

(a) General rule of privilege. A patient has a privilege to 
refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing 
a confidential communication made between the patient and a 
psychotherapist or an assistant to the psychotherapist, in a case 
arising under the UCMJ, if such communication was made for the 
purpose of facilitating diagnosis or treatment of the patient's 
mental or emotional condition.

(b) Definitions. As used in this rule of evidence:

  (1) A ``patient'' is a person who consults with or is examined 
or interviewed by a psychotherapist for purposes of advice, 
diagnosis, or treatment of a mental or emotional condition.

  (2) A ``psychotherapist'' is a psychiatrist, clinical 
psychologist, or clinical social worker who is licensed in any 
state, territory, possession, the District of Columbia or Puerto 
Rico to perform professional services as such, or who holds 
credentials to provide such services

[[Page 227]]

from any military health care facility, or is a person reasonably 
believed by the patient to have such license or credentials.

  (3) An ``assistant to a psychotherapist'' is a person directed 
by or assigned to assist a psychotherapist in providing 
professional services, or is reasonably believed by the patient to 
be such.

  (4) A communication is ``confidential'' if not intended to be 
disclosed to third persons other than those to whom disclosure is 
in furtherance of the rendition of professional services to the 
patient or those reasonably necessary for such transmission of the 
communication.

  (5) ``Evidence of a patient's records or communications'' is 
testimony of a psychotherapist, or assistant to the same, or 
patient records that pertain to communications by a patient to a 
psychotherapist, or assistant to the same for the purposes of 
diagnosis or treatment of the patient's mental or emotional 
condition.

(c) Who may claim the privilege. The privilege may be claimed by 
the patient or the guardian or conservator of the patient. A 
person who may claim the privilege may authorize trial counsel or 
defense counsel to claim the privilege on his or her behalf. The 
psychotherapist or assistant to the psychotherapist who received 
the communication may claim the privilege on behalf of the 
patient. The authority of such a psychotherapist, assistant, 
guardian, or conservator to so assert the privilege is presumed in 
the absence of evidence to the contrary.

(d) Exceptions. There is no privilege under this rule:

  (1) when the patient is dead;

  (2) when the communication is evidence of spouse abuse, child 
abuse, or neglect or in a proceeding in which one spouse is 
charged with a crime against the person of the other spouse or a 
child of either spouse;

  (3) when federal law, state law, or service regulation imposes 
a duty to report information contained in a communication;

  (4) when a psychotherapist or assistant to a psychotherapist 
believes that a patient's mental or emotional condition makes the 
patient a danger to any person, including the patient;

  (5) if the communication clearly contemplated the future 
commission of a fraud or crime or if the services of the 
psychotherapist are sought or obtained to enable or aid anyone to 
commit or plan to commit what the patient knew or reasonably 
should have known to be a crime or fraud;

  (6) when necessary to ensure the safety and security of 
military personnel, military dependents, military property, 
classified information, or the accomplishment of a military 
mission;

  (7) when an accused offers statements or other evidence 
concerning his mental condition in defense, extenuation, or 
mitigation, under circumstances not covered by R.C.M. 706 or Mil. 
R. Evid. 302. In such situations, the military judge may, upon 
motion, order disclosure of any statement made by the accused to a 
psychotherapist as may be necessary in the interests of justice; 
or

  (8) when admission or disclosure of a communication is 
constitutionally required.


[[Page 228]]


(e) Procedure to determine admissibility of patient records or 
communications.

  (1) In any case in which the production or admission of records 
or communications of a patient other than the accused is a matter 
in dispute, a party may seek an interlocutory ruling by the 
military judge. In order to obtain such a ruling, the party shall:

  (A) file a written motion at least 5 days prior to entry of 
pleas specifically describing the evidence and stating the purpose 
for which it is sought or offered, or objected to, unless the 
military judge, for good cause shown, requires a different time 
for filing or permits filing during trial; and

  (B) serve the motion on the opposing party, the military judge 
and, if practical, notify the patient or the patient's guardian, 
conservator, or representative that the motion has been filed and 
that the patient has an opportunity to be heard as set forth in 
subparagraph (e)(2).

  (2) Before ordering the production or admission of evidence of 
a patient's records or communication, the military judge shall 
conduct a hearing. Upon the motion of counsel for either party and 
upon good cause shown, the military judge may order the hearing 
closed. At the hearing, the parties may call witnesses, including 
the patient, and offer other relevant evidence. The patient shall 
be afforded a reasonable opportunity to attend the hearing and be 
heard at the patient's own expense unless the patient has been 
otherwise subpoenaed or ordered to appear at the hearing. However, 
the proceedings shall not be unduly delayed for this purpose. In a 
case before a court-martial composed of a military judge and 
members, the military judge shall conduct the hearing outside the 
presence of the members.

  (3) The military judge shall examine the evidence or a proffer 
thereof in camera, if such examination is necessary to rule on the 
motion.

  (4) To prevent unnecessary disclosure of evidence of a 
patient's records or communications, the military judge may issue 
protective orders or may admit only portions of the evidence.

  (5) The motion, related papers, and the record of the hearing 
shall be sealed and shall remain under seal unless the military 
judge or an appellate court orders otherwise.''

    b. Mil. R. Evid. 611 is amended by inserting the following new 
subsection at the end:

(d) Remote live testimony of a child.

  (1) In a case involving abuse of a child or domestic violence, 
the military judge shall, subject to the requirements of 
subsection (3) of this rule, allow a child victim or witness to 
testify from an area outside the courtroom as prescribed in R.C.M. 
914A.

  (2) The term ``child'' means a person who is under the age of 
16 at the time of his or her testimony. The term ``abuse of a 
child'' means the physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or 
exploitation, or negligent treatment of a child. The term 
``exploitation'' means child pornography or child prostitution. 
The term ``negligent treatment'' means the failure to provide, for 
reasons other than poverty, adequate food, clothing, shelter, or 
medical care so as to endanger seriously the physical health of 
the child. The term ``domestic violence'' means an offense that 
has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use

[[Page 229]]

of physical force against a person and is committed by a current 
or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim; by a person 
with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is 
cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, 
parent, or guardian; or by a person similarly situated to a 
spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.

  (3) Remote live testimony will be used only where the military 
judge makes a finding on the record that a child is unable to 
testify in open court in the presence of the accused, for any of 
the following reasons:

  (A) The child is unable to testify because of fear;

  (B) There is substantial likelihood, established by expert 
testimony, that the child would suffer emotional trauma from 
testifying;

  (C) The child suffers from a mental or other infirmity; or

  (D) Conduct by an accused or defense counsel causes the child 
to be unable to continue testifying.

  (4) Remote live testimony of a child shall not be utilized 
where the accused elects to absent himself from the courtroom in 
accordance with R.C.M. 804(c).''

Sec. 3. Part IV of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, is 
amended as follows:
    a. Insert the following new paragraph after paragraph 100:

100a. Article 134--(Reckless endangerment)

a. Text. See paragraph 60.

b. Elements.

  (1) That the accused did engage in conduct;

  (2) That the conduct was wrongful and reckless or wanton;

  (3) That the conduct was likely to produce death or grievous 
bodily harm to another person; and

  (4) That under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused 
was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed 
forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed 
forces.

c. Explanation.

  (1) In general. This offense is intended to prohibit and 
therefore deter reckless or wanton conduct that wrongfully creates 
a substantial risk of death or serious injury to others.

  (2) Wrongfulness. Conduct is wrongful when it is without legal 
justification or excuse.

  (3) Recklessness. ``Reckless'' conduct is conduct that exhibits 
a culpable disregard of foreseeable consequences to others from 
the act or omission involved. The accused need not intentionally 
cause a resulting harm or know that his conduct is substantially 
certain to cause that result. The ultimate question is whether, 
under all the circumstances, the accused's conduct was of that 
heedless nature that made it actually or imminently dangerous to 
the rights or safety of others.

  (4) Wantonness. ``Wanton'' includes ``reckless,'' but may 
connote willfulness, or a disregard of probable consequences, and 
thus describe a more aggravated offense.

  (5) Likely to produce. When the natural or probable consequence 
of particular conduct would be death or grievous bodily harm, it 
may be

[[Page 230]]

inferred that the conduct is ``likely'' to produce that result. 
See paragraph 54c(4)(a)(ii).

  (6) Grievous bodily harm. ``Grievous bodily harm'' means 
serious bodily injury. It does not include minor injuries, such as 
a black eye or a bloody nose, but does include fractured or 
dislocated bones, deep cuts, torn members of the body, serious 
damage to internal organs, and other serious bodily injuries.

  (7) Death or injury not required. It is not necessary that 
death or grievous bodily harm be actually inflicted to prove 
reckless endangerment.

d. Lesser included offenses. None.

e. Maximum punishment. Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all 
pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.

f. Sample specification. In that ______________________ (personal 
jurisdiction data), did, (at/on board--location) (subject-matter 
jurisdiction data, if required), on or about 
________________________ 19____, wrongfully and recklessly engage 
in conduct, to wit:

(he/she)(describe conduct) and that the accused's conduct was 
likely to cause death or serious bodily harm to 
__________________.''

Sec. 4. These amendments shall take effect on 1 November 1999, subject 
to the following:
    a. The amendments made to Military Rule of Evidence 611, shall apply 
only in cases in which arraignment has been completed on or after 1 
November 1999.
    b. Military Rule of Evidence 513 shall only apply to communications 
made after 1 November 1999.
    c. The amendments made to Rules for Courts-Martial 502, 804, and 
914A shall only apply in cases in which arraignment has been completed 
on or after 1 November 1999.
    d. The amendments made to Rules for Courts-Martial 1001(b)(4) and 
1004(c)(7) shall only apply to offenses committed after 1 November 1999.
    e. Nothing in these amendments shall be construed to make punishable 
any act done or omitted prior to 1 November 1999, which was not 
punishable when done or omitted.
    f. The maximum punishment for an offense committed prior to 1 
November 1999, shall not exceed the applicable maximum in effect at the 
time of the commission of such offense.
    g. Nothing in these amendments shall be construed to invalidate any 
nonjudicial punishment proceeding, restraint, investigation, referral of 
charges, trial in which arraignment occurred, or other action begun 
prior to 1 November 1999, and any such nonjudicial punishment, 
restraint, investigation, referral of charges, trial, or other action 
may proceed in the same manner and with the same effect as if these 
amendments had not been prescribed.

<R05>
Changes to the Analysis Accompanying the Manual for Courts-Martial, 
United States.

1. Changes to Appendix 21, the Analysis accompanying the Rules for 
Courts-Martial, United States (Part II, MCM).
    a. R.C.M. 502(c). The analysis accompanying R.C.M. 502(c) is amended 
by inserting the following at the end thereof:
       ``1999 Amendment: R.C.M. 502(c) was amended to delete the 
requirement that military judges be ``on active duty'' to enable Reserve 
Component judges to conduct trials during periods of inactive duty for 
training (IDT) and inactive duty training travel (IATT). The active duty 
requirement does not appear in Article 26, UCMJ which prescribes the 
qualifications for military judges. It appears to be a vestigial 
requirement from paragraph 4e of the 1951 and 1969 MCM. Neither the 
current MCM nor its predecessors provide an explanation for this 
additional requirement. It was deleted to enhance efficiency in the 
military justice system.''
    b. R.C.M. 804(c). The analysis accompanying R.C.M. 804 is amended by 
redesignating the current subsection (c) as subsection (d) and by 
inserting after subsection (b) the following new subsection (c):
      ``(c) Voluntary absence for limited purpose of child testimony.
      1999 Amendment: The amendment provides for two-way closed circuit 
television to transmit a child's testimony from the courtroom to the 
accused's location. The use of two-way closed circuit television, to 
some degree, may defeat the purpose of these alternative procedures, 
which is to avoid trauma to children. In such cases, the judge has 
discretion to direct one-way television communication. The use of one-
way closed circuit television was approved by the Supreme Court in 
Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 (1990). This amendment also gives the 
accused the election to absent himself from the courtroom to prevent 
remote testimony. Such a provision gives the accused a greater role in 
determining how this issue will be resolved.''
    c. R.C.M. 914A. Insert the following analysis after the analysis to 
R.C.M. 914:
      ``1999 Amendment: This rule allows the military judge to 
determine what procedure to use when taking testimony under Mil. R. 
Evid. 611(d)(3). It states that normally such testimony should be taken 
via a two-way closed circuit television system. The rule further 
prescribes the procedures to be used if a television system is employed. 
The use of two-way closed circuit television, to some degree, may defeat 
the purpose of these alternative procedures, which is to avoid trauma to 
children. In such cases, the judge has discretion to direct one-way 
television communication. The use of one-way closed circuit television 
was approved by the Supreme Court in Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 
(1990). This amendment also gives the accused an election to absent 
himself from the courtroom to prevent remote testimony. Such a provision 
gives the accused a greater role in determining how this issue will be 
resolved.''
    d. R.C.M. 1001(b)(4). The analysis to R.C.M. 1001(b)(4) is amended 
by inserting the following paragraph before the analysis of R.C.M. 
1001(b)(5):

[[Page 232]]

      ``1999 Amendment: R.C.M. 1001(b)(4) was amended by elevating to 
the Rule language that heretofore appeared in the Discussion to the 
Rule. The Rule was further amended to recognize that evidence that the 
offense was a ``hate crime'' may also be presented to the sentencing 
authority. The additional ``hate crime'' language was derived in part 
from section 3A1.1 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, in which hate 
crime motivation results in an upward adjustment in the level of the 
offense for which the defendant is sentenced. Courts-martial sentences 
are not awarded upon the basis of guidelines, such as the Federal 
Sentencing Guidelines, but rather upon broad considerations of the needs 
of the service and the accused and on the premise that each sentence is 
individually tailored to the offender and offense. The upward adjustment 
used in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines does not directly translate to 
the court-martial presentencing procedure. Therefore, in order to adapt 
this concept to the court-martial process, this amendment was made to 
recognize that ``hate crime'' motivation is admissible in the court-
martial presentencing procedure. This amendment also differs from the 
Federal Sentencing Guideline in that the amendment does not specify the 
burden of proof required regarding evidence of ``hate crime'' 
motivation. No burden of proof is customarily specified regarding 
aggravating evidence admitted in the presentencing procedure, with the 
notable exception of aggravating factors under R.C.M. 1004 in capital 
cases.''
    e. R.C.M. 1003(b). The analysis accompanying R.C.M. 1003 is amended 
by adding the following as the last paragraph of the analysis:
      ``1999 Amendment: Loss of numbers, lineal position, or seniority 
has been deleted. Although loss of numbers had the effect of lowering 
precedence for some purposes, e.g., quarters priority, board and court 
seniority, and actual date of promotion, loss of numbers did not affect 
the officer's original position for purposes of consideration for 
retention or promotion. Accordingly, this punishment was deleted because 
of its negligible consequences and the misconception that it was a 
meaningful punishment.''
    f. R.C.M. 1004. The analysis to R.C.M. 1004(c)(7) is amended by 
adding the following as the last paragraph of the analysis:
      ``1999 Amendment: R.C.M. 1004(c)(7)(K) was added to afford 
greater protection to victims who are especially vulnerable due to their 
age.''
2. Changes to Appendix 22, the Analysis accompanying the Military Rules 
of Evidence (Part III, MCM).
    a. Mil. R. Evid. 501. The analysis to Mil. R. Evid. 501 is amended--
      (1) by striking:
    ``The privilege expressed in Rule 302 and its conforming Manual 
change in Para. 121, is not a doctor-patient privilege and is not 
affected by Rule 501(d).''
      (2) by adding at the end:
      ``1999 Amendment: The privileges expressed in Rule 513 and Rule 
302 and the conforming Manual change in R.C.M. 706, are not physician-
patient privileges and are not affected by Rule 501(d).''
    b. Mil. R. Evid. 513. Insert the following analysis after the 
analysis of Mil. R. Evid. 512:

[[Page 233]]

      ``1999 Amendment: Military Rule of Evidence 513 establishes a 
psychotherapist-patient privilege for investigations or proceedings 
authorized under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Rule 513 
clarifies military law in light of the Supreme Court decision in Jaffee 
v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 116 S. Ct. 1923, 135 L.Ed.2d 337 (1996). Jaffee 
interpreted Federal Rule of Evidence 501 to create a federal 
psychotherapist-patient privilege in civil proceedings and refers 
federal courts to state laws to determine the extent of privileges. In 
deciding to adopt this privilege for courts-martial, the committee 
balanced the policy of following federal law and rules, when practicable 
and not inconsistent with the UCMJ or MCM, with the needs of commanders 
for knowledge of certain types of information affecting the military. 
The exceptions to the rule have been developed to address the 
specialized society of the military and separate concerns that must be 
met to ensure military readiness and national security. See Parker v. 
Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 743 (1974); U.S. ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.S. 
11, 17 (1955); Dept. of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 530 (1988). 
There is no intent to apply Rule 513 in any proceeding other than those 
authorized under the UCMJ. Rule 513 was based in part on proposed Fed. 
R. Evid. (not adopted) 504 and state rules of evidence.
      Rule 513 is not a physician-patient privilege. It is a separate 
rule based on the social benefit of confidential counseling recognized 
by Jaffee, and similar to the clergy-penitent privilege. In keeping with 
American military law since its inception, there is still no physician-
patient privilege for members of the Armed Forces. See the analyses for 
Rule 302 and Rule 501.
    (a) General rule of privilege. The words ``under the UCMJ'' in this 
rule mean Rule 513 applies only to UCMJ proceedings, and do not limit 
the availability of such information internally to the services, for 
appropriate purposes.
    (d) Exceptions. These exceptions are intended to emphasize that 
military commanders are to have access to all information that is 
necessary for the safety and security of military personnel, operations, 
installations, and equipment. Therefore, psychotherapists are to provide 
such information despite a claim of privilege.''
    c. Mil. R. Evid. 611. The analysis accompanying Rule 611 is amended 
by adding at the end of the analysis the following:
      ``1999 Amendment: Rule 611(d) is new. This amendment to Rule 611 
gives substantive guidance to military judges regarding the use of 
alternative examination methods for child victims and witnesses in light 
of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836 
(1990) and the change in Federal law in 18 U.S.C. section 3509. Although 
Maryland v. Craig dealt with child witnesses who were themselves the 
victims of abuse, it should be noted that 18 U.S.C. section 3509, as 
construed by Federal courts, has been applied to allow non-victim child 
witnesses to testify remotely. See, e.g., United States v. Moses, 137 
F.3d 894 (6th Cir. 1998) (applying section 3509 to a non-victim child 
witness, but reversing a child sexual assault conviction on other 
grounds) and United States v. Quintero, 21 F.3d 885 (9th Cir. 1994) 
(affirming conviction based on remote testimony of non-victim child 
witness, but remanding for re-sentencing). This amendment recognizes 
that child witnesses may be particularly traumatized, even if they are 
not

[[Page 234]]

themselves the direct victims, in cases involving the abuse of other 
children or domestic violence. This amendment also gives the accused an 
election to absent himself from the courtroom to prevent remote 
testimony. Such a provision gives the accused a greater role in 
determining how this issue will be resolved.''
3. Changes to Appendix 23, the Analysis accompanying the Punitive 
Articles (Part IV, MCM).
    The following paragraph is inserted after the analysis of paragraph 
100:
    ``100a. Article 134--(Reckless endangerment)
    c. Explanation. This paragraph is new and is based on United States 
v. Woods, 28 M.J. 318 (C.M.A. 1989); see also Md. Ann. Code art. 27, 
sect. 120. The definitions of ``reckless'' and ``wanton'' have been 
taken from Article 111 (drunken or reckless driving). The definition of 
``likely to produce grievous bodily harm'' has been taken from Article 
128 (assault).''


<R05>
Changes to Forms of Sentences of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United 
States

    a. Paragraph b of Appendix 11, Forms of Sentences, is amended--
      (1) by striking the catch phrase ``Loss of Numbers, Etc.''
      (2) by striking subparagraph 6;
      (3) by striking subparagraph 7;
      (5) by striking the last sentence from the Note at the end of 
Paragraph b.
    b. Paragraph b of Appendix 11, Forms of Sentences, is amended by 
redesignating paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 as 
paragraphs 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 respectively.


<R05>
Changes to the Maximum Punishment Chart of the Manual for Courts-
Martial, United States

    Appendix 12, the Maximum Punishment Chart, is amended by adding 
after Art. 134 (Quarantine, breaking) the following:
    ``Reckless endangerment . . . . BCD 1 yr. Total''


<R05>
Changes to the Discussion Accompanying the Manual for Courts-Martial, 
United States

    a. The Discussion following R.C.M. 1001(b)(4) is amended by striking 
the first paragraph.
    b. The Discussion to R.C.M. 1003(b) is amended by striking 
subparagraph (4).

<R05>
Executive Order 13141 of November 16, 1999

Environmental Review of Trade Agreements

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to further the 
environmental and trade policy goals of the United States, it is hereby 
ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. The United States is committed to a policy of careful 
assessment and consideration of the environmental impacts of trade 
agreements. The United States will factor environmental considerations 
into the development of its trade negotiating objectives. Responsible 
agencies will accomplish these goals through a process of ongoing 
assessment and evaluation, and, in certain instances, written 
environmental reviews.
Sec. 2. Purpose and Need. Trade agreements should contribute to the 
broader goal of sustainable development. Environmental reviews are an 
important tool to help identify potential environmental effects of trade 
agreements, both positive and negative, and to help facilitate 
consideration of appropriate responses to those effects whether in the 
course of negotiations, through other means, or both.
Sec. 3. (a) Implementation. The United States Trade Representative 
(Trade Representative) and the Chair of the Council on Environmental 
Quality shall oversee the implementation of this order, including the 
development of procedures pursuant to this order, in consultation with 
appropriate foreign policy, environmental, and economic agencies.
    (b) Conduct of Environmental Reviews. The Trade Representative, 
through the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC), shall 
conduct the environmental reviews of the agreements under section 4 of 
this order.
Sec. 4. Trade Agreements.
    (a) Certain agreements that the United States may negotiate shall 
require an environmental review. These include:
    (i) comprehensive multilateral trade rounds;
    (ii) bilateral or plurilateral free trade agreements; and
    (iii) major new trade liberalization agreements in natural resource 
sectors.
    (b) Agreements reached in connection with enforcement and dispute 
resolution actions are not covered by this order.
    (c) For trade agreements not covered under subsections 4(a) and (b), 
environmental reviews will generally not be required. Most sectoral 
liberalization agreements will not require an environmental review. The 
Trade Representative, through the TPSC, shall determine whether an 
environmental review of an agreement or category of agreements is 
warranted based on such factors as the significance of reasonably 
foreseeable environmental impacts.
Sec. 5. Environmental Reviews.
    (a) Environmental reviews shall be:
    (i) written;

[[Page 236]]

    (ii) initiated through a Federal Register notice, outlining the 
proposed agreement and soliciting public comment and information on the 
scope of the environmental review of the agreement;
    (iii) undertaken sufficiently early in the process to inform the 
development of negotiating positions, but shall not be a condition for 
the timely tabling of particular negotiating proposals;
    (iv) made available in draft form for public comment, where 
practicable; and
    (v) made available to the public in final form.
    (b) As a general matter, the focus of environmental reviews will be 
impacts in the United States. As appropriate and prudent, reviews may 
also examine global and transboundary impacts.
Sec. 6. Resources. Upon request by the Trade Representative, with the 
concurrence of the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of 
Management and Budget, Federal agencies shall, to the extent permitted 
by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, provide 
analytical and financial resources and support, including the detail of 
appropriate personnel, to the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative to carry out the provisions of this order.
Sec. 7. General Provisions. This order is intended only to improve the 
internal management of the executive branch and does not create any 
right, benefit, trust, or responsibility, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its 
agencies, its officers, or any person.

Notice of January 20, 1999

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt 
the Middle East Peace Process

On January 23, 1995, by Executive Order 12947, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by grave acts of violence committed by foreign terrorists 
that disrupt the Middle East peace process. By Executive Order 12947 of 
January 23, 1995, I blocked the assets in the United States, or in the 
control of United States persons, of foreign terrorists who threaten to 
disrupt the Middle East peace process. I also prohibited transactions or 
dealings by United States persons in such property. On August 20, 1998, 
by Executive Order 13099, I identified four additional persons, 
including Usama bin Ladin, that threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process. I have annually transmitted notices of the continuation 
of this national emergency to the Congress and the Federal Register. 
Last year's notice of continuation was published in the Federal Register 
on January 22, 1998. Because terrorist activities continue to threaten 
the Middle East peace process and vital interests of the United States 
in the Middle East, the national emergency declared on January 23,

[[Page 250]]

1995, and the measures that took effect on January 24, 1995, to deal 
with that emergency must continue in effect beyond January 23, 1999. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to foreign terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East 
peace process.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Presidential Determination No. 99-10 of January 25, 1999

Determination Pursuant to Section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee 
Assistance Act of 1962, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 2(c)(1) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act 
of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(c)(1), I hereby determine that it is 
important to the national interest that up to $25 million be made 
available from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund 
to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of refugees and migrants.
These funds may be used to meet the urgent and unexpected needs of 
refugees, displaced persons, victims of conflict, and other persons at 
risk due to the Kosovo crisis. These funds may be used, as appropriate, 
to provide contributions to international and nongovernmental 
organizations.
You are authorized and directed to inform the appropriate committees of 
the Congress of this determination and the use of funds under this 
authority, and to arrange for the publication of this determination in 
the Federal Register.

Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 523 of the Foreign 
Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 
1999 (as Contained in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, Public Law 105-277)

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to section 523 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and 
Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1999 (as contained in the Omnibus 
Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, Public 
Law 105-277), I hereby certify that withholding from international 
financial institutions and other international organizations and 
programs funds appropriated or otherwise made available pursuant to that 
Act is contrary to the national interest.
You are authorized and directed to publish this determination in the 
Federal Register.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Presidential Determination No. 99-12 of February 3, 1999

Vietnamese Cooperation in Accounting for United States Prisoners of War 
and Missing in Action (POW/MIA)

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
As provided under section 609 of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, 
and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999, 
as contained in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental 
Appropriations Act, 1999, Public Law 105-277, I hereby determine, based 
on all information available to the United States Government, that the 
Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is fully cooperating in 
good faith with the United States in the following four areas related to 
achieving the fullest possible accounting for Americans unaccounted for 
as a result of the Vietnam War:

 1)  resolving discrepancy cases, live sightings, and field activities;
 2)  recovering and repatriating American remains;
 3)  accelerating efforts to provide documents that will help lead to the fullest possible accounting of POW/
      MIAs; and,
 4)  providing further assistance in implementing trilateral investigations with Laos.

I further determine that the appropriate laboratories associated with 
POW/MIA accounting are thoroughly analyzing remains, material, and other 
information and fulfilling their responsibilities as set forth in 
subsection (B)

[[Page 252]]

of section 609, and information pertaining to this accounting is being 
made available to immediate family members in compliance with 50 U.S.C. 
435 note.
I have been advised by the Department of Justice that section 609 is 
unconstitutional because it purports to use a condition on 
appropriations as a means to direct my execution of responsibilities 
that the Constitution commits exclusively to the President. I am 
providing this determination as a matter of comity with the Congress, 
while reserving the position that the condition enacted in section 609 
is unconstitutional.
In making this determination, I have taken into account all information 
available to the United States Government as reported to me, including 
the full range of ongoing accounting activities in Vietnam, joint and 
unilateral Vietnamese efforts, and the concrete results we have attained 
as a result of these efforts.
Finally, in making this determination, I wish to reaffirm my continuing 
personal commitment to the entire POW/MIA community, especially to the 
immediate families, relatives, friends, and supporters of these brave 
individuals, and to reconfirm that the central, guiding principle of my 
Vietnam policy is to achieve the fullest possible accounting of our 
prisoners of war and missing in action.
You are authorized and directed to report this determination to the 
appropriate committees of the Congress and to publish it in the Federal 
Register.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    Washington, February 3, 1999.



Presidential Determination No. 99-13 of February 4, 1999

Designations Under the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the United 
States, including under section 5 of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 
(Public Law 105-338) (the ``Act''), I hereby determine that each of the 
following groups is a democratic opposition organization and that each 
satisfies the criteria set forth in section 5(c) of the Act: the Iraqi 
National Accord, the Iraqi National Congress, the Islamic Movement of 
Iraqi Kurdistan, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, the Movement for 
Constitutional Monarchy, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and the 
Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. I hereby designate 
each of these organizations as eligible to receive assistance under 
section 4 of the Act.
You are authorized and directed to report this determination and 
designation to the Congress and arrange for its publication in the 
Federal Register.

Presidential Determination No. 99-14 of February 16, 1999

Presidential Certification To Waive Prohibition on Assistance to the 
Republic of Montenegro

Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the laws of the United States, 
including section 1511 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160), I hereby certify to the Congress 
that I have determined that the waiver of the application of the 
prohibition in section 1511(b) of Public Law 103-160 is necessary to 
achieve a negotiated settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
that is acceptable to the parties, to the extent that such provision 
applies to the furnishing of assistance to the Republic of Montenegro.
Therefore, I hereby waive the application of this provision with respect 
to such assistance.
You are authorized and directed to transmit a copy of this determination 
to the Congress and arrange for its publication in the Federal Register.

    Washington, February 16, 1999.



Notice of February 24, 1999

Continuation of the National Emergency Relating to Cuba and of the 
Emergency Authority Relating to the Regulation of the Anchorage and 
Movement of Vessels

On March 1, 1996, by Proclamation 6867, I declared a national emergency 
to address the disturbance or threatened disturbance of international 
relations caused by the February 24, 1996, destruction by the Government 
of Cuba of two unarmed U.S.-registered civilian aircraft in 
international airspace north of Cuba. In July 1996 and on subsequent 
occasions, the Government of Cuba stated its intent to forcefully defend 
its sovereignty against any U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft that 
might enter Cuban territorial waters or airspace while involved in a 
memorial flotilla and peaceful protest. Since these events, the 
Government of Cuba has not demonstrated that it will refrain from the 
future use of reckless and excessive force against U.S. vessels or 
aircraft that may engage in memorial activities or peaceful protest 
north of Cuba. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the 
national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority 
relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set 
out in Proclamation 6867.

[[Page 254]]

This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Presidential Determination No. 99-15 of February 26, 1999

Certification for Major Illicit Drug Producing and Drug Transit 
Countries

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 490(b)(1)(A) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (``the Act''), I hereby 
determine and certify that the following major illicit drug producing 
and/or major illicit drug transit countries/dependent territories have 
cooperated fully with the United States, or have taken adequate steps on 
their own, to achieve full compliance with the goals and objectives of 
the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic 
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances:

    Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, 
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, 
Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and 
Vietnam.

By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 490(b)(1)(B) of the 
Act, I hereby determine that it is in the vital national interests of 
the United States to certify the following major illicit drug producing 
and/or major illicit drug transit countries:

    Cambodia, Haiti, Nigeria, and Paraguay.

Analysis of the relevant U.S. vital national interests, as required 
under section 490(b)(3) of the Act, is attached.
I have determined that the following major illicit drug producing and/or 
major illicit drug transit countries do not meet the standards set forth 
in section 490(b) for certification:

    Afghanistan, Burma.

In making these determinations, I have considered the factors set forth 
in section 490 of the Act. Given that the performance of each of these 
countries/dependent territories has differed, I have attached an 
explanatory statement for each of the countries/dependent territories 
subject to this determination.

[[Page 255]]

You are hereby authorized and directed to report this determination to 
the Congress immediately and to publish it in the Federal Register.

STATEMENTS OF EXPLANATION




Afghanistan

    According to U.S. Government (USG) estimates, Afghanistan continued 
to be the world's second largest producer of opium poppy in 1998. Poppy 
cultivation and opium gum production increased by seven percent in 1998, 
despite poor weather, resulting in an estimated 1,350 metric tons (mts) 
of opium gum production. Afghanistan is a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, but neither of the warring political factions (Taliban nor 
Northern Alliance) took steps to demonstrate that they take 
Afghanistan's obligations under the Convention seriously. Aside from 
Taliban authorities burning a reported one ton of opiates in Jalalabad 
in June, there is no evidence to indicate that any action was taken by 
any faction to discourage poppy cultivation, destroy morphine or heroin 
laboratories, or arrest and prosecute narcotics traffickers. Numerous 
reports indicated that members of all factions at all levels continued 
to profit from the drug trade. UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) 
initiatives made very slow progress, while a USG-funded non-governmental 
organization (NGO) program achieved many of its alternative development 
goals.
    By the end of the year, the Taliban faction controlled over 80 
percent of Afghan territory and 96 percent of Afghanistan's opium-
growing areas. The Taliban's inaction and lack of political will, as 
well as substantial drug trade involvement on the part of some local 
Taliban authorities, also impede meaningful counter-narcotics progress.
    The Taliban condemned illicit drug cultivation, production, 
trafficking and use in 1997. However, there is no evidence that Taliban 
authorities took action in 1998 to decrease poppy cultivation, to arrest 
and prosecute major narcotics traffickers, to interdict large shipments 
of illicit drugs or precursor chemicals, or to eliminate opiate 
processing laboratories anywhere in Afghanistan. Opium is Afghanistan's 
largest cash crop and, by many estimates, narcotics remain a significant 
and perhaps the largest source of income. Some Taliban authorities 
reportedly benefit financially from the trade and provide protection to 
heroin laboratories. There are numerous reports of drug traffickers 
operating in Taliban territory with the consent or involvement of some 
Taliban officials.
    In 1998, poppy cultivation increased and spread to new areas. In an 
unverified policy statement published by the Taliban's High Commission 
for Drug Control on September 10, 1998, which appears to contradict the 
Taliban's November 1997 commitment to UNDCP, the Taliban indicated that 
they would not support a strategy of forced eradication if farmers who 
benefitted from alternative development failed to comply with the 
requirement to abandon poppy cultivation.

[[Page 256]]

    A USG-sponsored poppy eradication/alternative development program in 
Helmand Province through Mercy Corps International (MCI), an American 
NGO, continued this year. It was originally funded in 1997 for $772,000 
and expanded in FY 99 to $1.04 million. It is the only poppy reduction 
project being implemented by an NGO in Afghanistan. MCI accomplished all 
but one of its objectives during the year. The one objective not 
accomplished--delivery of fruit trees to farmers--was not met due to 
rainy weather. The trees were held for the next planting season.
    The USG strongly supports the UN Special Mission to Afghanistan and 
its efforts to achieve peace and facilitate the development of a broad-
based government that respects international norms of behavior on 
narcotics, terrorism and human rights. The Afghan Support Group (ASG) of 
major donors to Afghanistan met twice during the year. At the meeting in 
Tokyo in December, the ASG endorsed the principle that counter-narcotics 
is a cross-cutting issue and should be integrated wherever possible with 
other programs in Afghanistan. UNDCP agreed to include gender and human 
rights components in its counter-narcotics programs wherever 
appropriate.
    Denial of certification does not cut off USG counter-narcotics 
assistance and would thus have minimal effect in terms of implementation 
of this policy. Continuation of large-scale opium cultivation and 
trafficking in Afghanistan, plus the failure of the authorities to 
initiate law enforcement actions, preclude a determination that 
Afghanistan has taken adequate steps on its own or that it has 
sufficiently cooperated with USG counter-narcotics efforts to meet the 
goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to which 
Afghanistan is a party.



Aruba

    Aruba is a staging area for international narcotics trafficking 
organizations, which transship cocaine from Colombia, Venezuela, and 
Suriname to Europe and the United States. Drug traffickers are attracted 
to Aruba by its key position near the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts, 
its efficient infrastructure, its excellent air and sea links to South 
America, Europe, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean locations, and its 
reputation for relatively light prison sentences and good prison 
conditions.
    Aruba, the nearby Netherlands Antilles, and the Netherlands comprise 
the three parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Since 1986, Aruba has 
had autonomy over its internal affairs and independent decision-making 
ability in a number of counter-narcotics areas. The Government of the 
Netherlands (GON) is responsible for the defense and foreign affairs of 
Aruba, and assists the Government of Aruba (GOA) in its efforts to 
combat narcotics trafficking. Aruba is a participant in a joint 
Netherlands-Netherlands Antilles-Aruba Coast Guard, which has anti-drug 
responsibilities. Although the Netherlands is a party to the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention, the other two parts of the Kingdom are not covered by 
the Convention.
    In late 1998, Aruba passed an international asset seizure law, the 
final legislative prerequisite to requesting that the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands extend the 1988 UN Drug Convention to Aruba. In December, 
Aruba formally requested that extension, which is expected during 1999.

[[Page 257]]

    During 1998, the GOA continued to cooperate fully with the USG on 
counter-narcotics goals and objectives. Three Aruba nationals believed 
to be major drug traffickers and money launderers were extradited to the 
United States and are now awaiting trial. They include two members of 
the Mansur family, one of the richest and most powerful in Aruba, who 
are accused of belonging to a large network that laundered some $40 
million for Colombian drug traffickers operating in the United States. 
These extraditions were the first under a 1997 law permitting the 
extradition of Aruba nationals.
    Aruba law enforcement agencies, including the Aruba Police and 
Customs, have a good working relationship with USG law enforcement 
agencies. They cooperate with the DEA on joint investigations and with 
the U.S. Coast Guard on maritime law enforcement searches and 
interdictions. Joint USG-GOA efforts contributed to an increase in the 
number of arrests in 1998 of drug couriers transiting Aruba. A proposed 
U.S.-Kingdom of the Netherlands maritime drug enforcement agreement, 
pertaining to the Caribbean, is currently under negotiation.



The Bahamas

    The Bahamas is a major transit point for South American cocaine and 
Jamaican marijuana en route to the United States. Very small amounts of 
cannabis are grown on the islands for domestic consumption. The USG and 
the Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas (GCOB) continue to 
enjoy a productive and positive counter-drug working relationship. The 
GCOB places a high priority on combating drug transshipments through its 
archipelago, and is moving decisively to combat money laundering and 
other drug-related crimes. The GCOB cooperates very closely with the USG 
on our combined law enforcement effort, Operation Bahamas and Turks and 
Caicos (OPBAT). The Bahamas was the first country to ratify the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention, and the GCOB continues to take steps to implement its 
provisions. Following passage of strong anti-money laundering 
legislation in 1996, Bahamian authorities are closely monitoring bank 
compliance and investigating suspicious financial transactions.
    U.S. and Bahamian law enforcement officials worked very closely 
throughout the year to respond to notable increases in air and maritime 
transshipment incidents. The GCOB is strongly emphasizing money 
laundering and asset forfeiture investigations and prosecutions. The 
GCOB also continued in 1998 to strengthen its judicial system, with 
assistance from the USG. However, unreliable jury pools and weaknesses 
in the drug laws resulted in several major Bahamian drug dealers 
avoiding conviction in 1998. Despite committed and talented judicial 
leadership, The Bahamas needs to improve the effectiveness of its court 
system in securing convictions against major dealers and organizations 
by strengthening its drug trafficking laws and improving the 
prosecutorial capabilities of the police prosecutors. The USG will 
continue to work with the GCOB in this area, both bilaterally and 
through regional training and assistance projects.
    In December 1998, the Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF) Drug 
Enforcement Unit arrested two police officers from the RBPF Drug Canine 
Unit at Nassau International Airport for allegedly working with a 
cocaine traf

ficking ring. The GCOB needs to continue to move decisively against 
corruption at Bahamian ports of entry.



Belize

    Belize remains a significant narcotics transit country. After taking 
office in August of 1998, the new Government of Belize (GOB) made it 
clear it takes seriously the problem of drug transit through its 
territory, including the impact the trafficking activity has on domestic 
crime. The new government has created a national drug abuse council, 
which is in the process of creating a comprehensive drug control 
strategy. The Belize Police Force, the Belize Defense Force and the 
rapid response force ``Dragon Unit'' will remain important parts of the 
national drug control strategy. Belize is party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention and the GOB works closely with the USG in the fight against 
narcotics trafficking and transnational crime.
    Upgrading training, professionalism and equipment in the Belize 
Defense Force continues as the focus of the USG/GOB counter-narcotics 
program to combat violent crime and drug trafficking. With the 
completion of training of the money-laundering unit staff, the USG/GOB 
effort is now focused on building and equipping a Financial 
Investigations Unit to enforce money-laundering regulations. The GOB is 
energetic in its unilateral efforts to reduce drug trafficking through 
its borders and to combat associated crime. It is a strong supporter of 
regional and cooperative counter-narcotics efforts.
    Concern over corruption remains. The dismissals of suspected corrupt 
police officials in 1998 and the new government's efforts to rid itself 
of institutional corruption appear to demonstrate the GOB's commitment. 
Concerns were raised, however, by the government's recent attempt to 
dismiss the Supreme Court's chief justice over a case with political 
overtones.
    Counter-narcotics efforts in Belize are hampered by lack of 
manpower, training and equipment. The relatively large expanse of 
uninhabited territory and the thousands of coastal cays and inland 
waterways that are used by traffickers as drop-off sites for drugs 
contribute to the problem. Seizures in 1998 of just under one metric ton 
of cocaine were significantly lower than in 1997. Slightly more than 
200,000 marijuana plants were eradicated.



Bolivia

    Bolivia retains is position as the world's second largest producer 
of cocaine even though it has less coca under cultivation than either 
Peru or Colombia. The cocaine industry in Bolivia is fragmented and 
dominated by small to mid-level trafficking organizations which 
manufacture, transport and distribute cocaine base in hundred to multi-
hundred kilogram quantities per month. Successful law enforcement 
efforts to prevent significant quantities of chemicals utilized in 
processing coca leaf into cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride (HCL) 
from being smuggled in from neighboring countries have negatively 
impacted the quality of cocaine produced, with a resulting decrease in 
marketability.

[[Page 259]]

    In an impressive show of resolve and political will, the Government 
of Bolivia (GOB) achieved an unprecedented level of coca eradication--a 
net reduction of 17 percent, and a gross eradication level of 11,621 
hectares. Significant successes in increased arrests of narcotics 
traffickers, as well as seizures of cocaine, cocaine products and 
precursor chemicals, were also realized.
    The Banzer administration is the first to devise and set forth a 
credible, formal strategy to eliminate coca cultivation in Bolivia. 
Despite a shaky start last spring and continuing violence against 
eradication and counter-narcotics forces, the GOB showed its 
determination to persevere with its five-year plan. USG experts also 
credit 1998's success to the GOB's abolition of direct compensation to 
coca growers, and to devoting enough human resources to the eradication 
and security effort. The Banzer administration's embrace of alternative 
development has not only provided farmers with licit, profitable 
alternatives to growing coca, but has changed public opinion against 
coca growing and cocaine production activities.
    Three-fourths of Bolivia's judicial reform package has been enacted, 
which should make the criminal justice system faster, more transparent 
and accessible, less politicized, and less corrupt. Currently being 
debated in the legislature is the Code of Criminal Procedure, the final 
part of the reform package. It should include language that permits 
police to use informants, controlled deliveries, undercover operations, 
and other modern law enforcement tools. Action on money laundering crime 
has been lacking, although the GOB named a Director of the Financial 
Investigations Unit of the Superintendency of Banks, which is charged 
with enforcing the anti-money laundering law.
    If Bolivia is to realize its five-year goals, in 1999 the GOB should 
act to prevent new coca plantings and continue eradication efforts in a 
sustained manner. Other important objectives include initiation of 
eradication operations, alternative development in the Yungas, and 
prosecutions of those who plant new illicit coca fields there and in the 
Chapare. The GOB should also move forward to implement vigorously the 
law criminalizing money laundering, and actively seek out, investigate 
and prosecute public officials engaged in corruption. Finally, if its 
efforts are to be fully successful, the GOB should ensure that the new 
Code of Criminal Procedures provides law enforcement authorities with 
the tools they need to investigate and prosecute narcotics offenders.



Brazil

    Brazil is a major transit country for cocaine shipped by air, river, 
and maritime routes from Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia to the United 
States and Europe. Because of increased interdiction of trafficker 
aircraft in Peru (along the Peru/Colombia air corridor), traffickers 
have shifted illicit narcotics flights into Brazilian air space. 
Brazil's vast and sparsely populated Amazon region provides ample 
opportunity for traffickers to transship drugs and chemicals by air and 
riverine routes. A southern ``drug route'' also exists along Brazil's 
borders with Paraguay and Bolivia. While not a major drug cultivation 
country, Brazil is a major producer of precursor chemicals and synthetic 
drugs.

[[Page 260]]

    Several key legislative initiatives, including an anti-money 
laundering law and legislation permitting the military to interdict 
unauthorized civilian aircraft (including those suspected of smuggling 
narcotics), were passed by the Congress in 1998. A two-year-old omnibus 
counter-narcotics bill remained pending in the Congress at year's end. 
Brazil's major counter-narcotics policy initiative was formation of the 
National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) which will coordinate counter-
narcotics efforts and activities nationwide.
    Federal police continued their heightened surveillance of the Amazon 
region, which resulted in seizures of drugs, aircraft, boats and an 
assortment of weapons. While seizures of cocaine in 1998 were about the 
same as in 1997, and marijuana seizures were slightly lower than in 
1997, seizures in psychotropic drugs increased tenfold over 1997 levels. 
Inadequate staffing and resources continue to hamper activities of the 
counter-narcotics unit of the Federal police.
    Although Brazil does not extradite its own citizens, the Government 
continues to cooperate with the United States and other countries in the 
extradition of individuals accused of narcotics-related crimes.
    Most of Brazil's demand reduction efforts are aimed primarily at 
young people, who constitute the largest group of drug users in the 
country. With the creation of SENAD, the GOB will focus even more 
attention on drug demand reduction, education, and treatment programs. 
Over half of Brazil's 26 states conduct some type of drug awareness 
program.
    Top Brazilian counter-narcotics officials in SENAD have expressed a 
strong interest in more active cooperation and greater coordination with 
the United States in narcotics law enforcement, including interdiction 
activities.



Burma

    Burma continues to be the world's largest source of illicit opium 
and heroin. There was, however, a significant decline in production and 
cultivation from 1997 levels. The 1998 crop estimates indicate there 
were 130,300 hectares of opium poppy cultivation, down 16 percent from 
1997. The potential yield from this crop is up to 1,750 metric tons of 
opium gum. This is the lowest potential production figure in ten years 
and a drop of 26 percent from 1997 figures. Most of this crop decrease 
was due to weather; however, the Government of Burma (GOB) did engage in 
opium crop eradication efforts.
    During 1998, seizures of methamphetamine tripled, although opium and 
heroin seizures were below last year's record levels. While there were 
cases of interdiction and arrests for narcotics trafficking of members 
of some tribal groups located outside the protected tribal areas, the 
GOB has been unwilling or unable to take on the most powerful groups 
directly. Cease-fire agreements with insurgent tribal groups dependent 
on the narcotics trade involve an implicit tolerance of continued 
involvement in illicit narcotics for varying periods of time. Given the 
scale of the problem in Burma, and what would be necessary to bring 
about lasting improvement, the GOB's efforts remain inadequate.

[[Page 261]]

    There is reason to believe that money laundering in Burma and the 
return of narcotics profits laundered elsewhere are significant factors 
in the overall Burmese economy, though the extent is impossible to 
measure accurately. Political and economic constraints on legal capital 
inflows magnify the importance of narcotics-derived funds in the 
economy. An underdeveloped banking system and lack of enforcement 
against money laundering have created a business and investment 
environment conducive to the use of drug-related proceeds in legitimate 
commerce. The GOB made little if any effort against money laundering 
during 1998.
    Despite some progress over the past year, the USG remains concerned 
that Burma's counter-narcotics efforts are in no way proportional to the 
extent of narcotics cultivation and trafficking. Effective toleration of 
money laundering by the GOB, failure to turn over notorious traffickers 
under indictment in the United States, and general lack of respect for 
the rule of law are also concerns. The United States remains prepared to 
cooperate with Burma in international efforts against narcotics, when 
the Burmese regime presents a consistent pattern of cooperation in all 
aspects of that effort.



Cambodia

    Throughout 1998, Cambodia was embroiled in internal political strife 
and proactive counter-narcotics efforts suffered. This failure is 
reflected in a serious drop in the statistics for seizures and narcotics 
arrests. Reports indicate that narcotics traffickers, alien smugglers, 
and other criminals have found refuge in Cambodia. Corruption and 
factionalism among Cambodia's police are also a continuing problem--one 
police unit attacked another earlier this year in an effort to 
intimidate the unit attacked. Cambodia is not a major producer of 
narcotics or a center for narcotics-derived money laundering, although 
reports that narcotics proceeds are in fact laundered there persist. The 
country's principal involvement in the international narcotics trade is 
as a transit route for Southeast Asian heroin intended for overseas 
markets, including the United States. Marijuana is cultivated for export 
and the authorities have had only marginal success at stemming this 
flow, though Cambodian marijuana is not thought to have a major effect 
on the United States. Reports persist about the involvement by some 
elements of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and the national police in 
narcotics trafficking.
    Outward cooperation by Cambodian police officials with the DEA on 
specific requests is excellent. Senior government officials consistently 
responded to requests to make available persons wanted on U.S. arrest 
warrants, including in narcotics cases. The Royal Government of Cambodia 
(RGC) has established a National Authority for Combating Drugs and a 
special drug enforcement unit in the Ministry of Interior; however, the 
effectiveness of these bodies has been limited by a lack of resources 
and training, corruption at various levels of the RGC, and the country's 
geographical location adjacent to major narcotics producing areas.
    In the latter part of 1998, competing factions in Cambodia finally 
formed a coalition government, resulting from elections. We believe that 
at this crucial time, imposition of counter-narcotics sanctions would 
undermine

[[Page 262]]

U.S. interests in democracy and regional stability as well as limit 
anti-narcotics efforts. The ability to provide strategically placed U.S. 
aid at the appropriate time can help strengthen Cambodian institutions, 
with the objective of promoting greater official accountability and 
adherence to the rule of law. Furthermore, it is in the U.S. interest 
for Cambodia to contribute to the political and economic stability of 
the region, which should be furthered by Cambodia's anticipated 
accession to ASEAN membership in 1999. Thus, on balance, the consequence 
for the United States related to the counter-narcotics setbacks are far 
outweighed by the risks of being unable to support the new coalition 
government now in place at this critical juncture.



China

    China continued to take strong and effective measures to combat the 
use and trafficking of narcotic drugs in 1998. China is a party to the 
1988 UN Drug Convention, as well as to the 1961 UN Single Convention and 
its protocols, and the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. 
The Chinese government is committed to achieving the goals of the 1988 
Convention, implementing several new initiatives to strengthen its 
counter-narcotics efforts at all levels, from apprehending and 
prosecuting traffickers to counteracting drug addition and abuse.
    Preliminary figures indicate that during 1998 Chinese police seized 
record amounts of heroin, other illicit drugs, and precursor chemicals. 
The Chinese government sponsored a nationwide education campaign aimed 
primarily at reducing drug use by youth. Narcotics enforcement 
cooperation between the United States and China continued to expand in 
1998, with increased levels of training, professional exchanges, and 
tactical-level enforcement cooperation. The United States and China 
established a Joint Liaison Group on Law Enforcement Cooperation, and 
are taking steps to further enhance mutual legal assistance; in general, 
however, China's response to U.S. requests could have been more 
forthcoming. The DEA anticipates the assignment of permanent staff for 
its new office in Beijing sometime in 1999.
    China is a major producer of precursor chemicals. The ephedra plant, 
from which the precursor chemical ephedrine is extracted, grows wild in 
northern China. China produces and legally exports potassium 
permanganate, which can be used in cocaine production. The Chinese 
government vigilantly monitors precursor chemical exports and has in 
place a system of pre-export notification. Yunnan, the province most 
directly affected by China's growing drug problem, goes further than the 
22 chemicals on the 1988 Convention Watch List by monitoring exports of 
28 chemicals. According to press reports, in the first ten months of 
1998, Yunnan provincial law enforcement authorities seized more than 300 
metric tons of precursor chemicals destined for illegal use, more than 
the amount confiscated nationwide in all of 1997. China supports a law 
enforcement program to increase interdiction in Yunnan Province under 
the auspices of the UNDCP and funded by the USG.
    Although Chinese law prohibits laundering the proceeds from illegal 
narcotics trafficking, China's legal system and banking regulations 
generally

[[Page 263]]

have not kept pace with the country's rapid economic 
internationalization. Consequently, China is vulnerable to possible 
exploitation by drug traffickers, particularly from Burma, seeking to 
launder money.



Colombia

    Colombia developed a solid record of success in meeting the 1998 
certification criteria, with several notable exceptions. A new counter-
narcotics strategy, developed by the incoming Pastrana administration 
earlier in the year, establishes a solid platform to frame efforts in 
the coming years. Such strategic planning was almost totally lacking in 
Colombia before then. The USG is working closely with the Government of 
Colombia (GOC) to refine and improve that strategy. Pastrana 
administration officials have been very receptive to U.S. offers of 
advice and assistance, and expressed a commitment in the Joint Alliance 
Against Drugs, signed during President Pastrana's visit in October 1998, 
to continue close cooperation as we advance our joint counter-narcotics 
goals. This willingness to cooperate closely is the greatest difference 
between the current status of efforts in Colombia and the checkered 
history of the last four years. While political will is difficult to 
measure and can only be tested by time, it appears that a corner has 
been turned in Colombia that will allow for much closer cooperation and 
greater results in the near future.
    The Colombian National Police (CNP), under the leadership of General 
Rosso Jose Serrano, added to its record of outstanding performance in 
counter-narcotics. This year the CNP received more and better support 
from the Colombian armed services, and joint operations in southern 
Colombia began to show success. Such joint operations will be an 
important factor in the future of the program, given the increasing 
threat to counter-narcotics operations from heavily armed traffickers 
and the guerrillas and paramilitaries who are involved in many aspects 
of narcotics trafficking. For the third straight year, record levels of 
illicit crops were eradicated, although this eradication did not offset 
the continuing expansion of cultivation by the traffickers as part of 
their effort to concentrate the entire drug industry within Colombia. 
The CNP also had a strong year in terms of seizures and arrests of 
important traffickers.
    Another key criterion was fully met when the GOC set up a successful 
program to register and regulate privately owned aircraft in Colombia, 
which has the effect of discouraging their use in narcotics trafficking. 
The GOC has also begun to take action on prison reform, a long-standing 
problem.
    The biggest disappointment of 1998 was the 5-4 decision of the 
Colombian Constitutional Court in August to uphold the new Colombian 
extradition law as passed by Congress. The court rejected the claim 
advanced and supported by both the Samper and Pastrana administrations 
that procedural irregularities in the congressional votes resulted in 
the passage of a law which does not apply retroactively. The lack of 
retroactivity in the law severely limits its effectiveness. As a result, 
the law places the imprisoned Cali cartel kingpins beyond the reach of 
U.S. justice, at least with regard to crimes committed before passage of 
the extradition law in December 1997.

[[Page 264]]

    The judicial system continues to be the weakest link in Colombia's 
counter-narcotics performance. 1998 saw little progress in resolving the 
endemic problems in a system that is plagued by corruption, incompetence 
and inefficiency. Asset forfeiture laws and money-laundering laws are 
still not enforced to any meaningful extent, and needed legislative 
reforms such as stiffer prison sentences for narcotics trafficking and 
establishment of legislation to deal with ongoing criminal enterprises 
have not been advanced.
    Overall, however, Colombian counter-narcotics performance improved 
in 1998, and the arrival of the new Pastrana administration gives 
grounds for optimism about the future.



Dominican Republic

    The Dominican Republic is a major transshipment point for drugs 
destined for the United States and Europe. Traffickers smuggle narcotics 
from Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama into Dominican territory by air and 
sea, and from Haiti by land routes. The drugs are then moved onward by 
air and sea to Puerto Rico and the United States.
    The Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) demonstrated strong 
counter-narcotics law enforcement and interdiction efforts in 1998. The 
GODR continued to cooperate fully with the USG on counter-narcotics 
goals and objectives, including expanded cooperation under the 1997 
bilateral maritime interdiction agreement. Cocaine and heroin seizures 
increased dramatically in 1998. The GODR initiated a new border patrol 
unit to control the flow of drugs into the Dominican Republic from 
Haiti. For the first time ever, the Dominican Republic and Haiti 
cooperated on an anti-drug smuggling border operation. The GODR and the 
USG signed an agreement to establish a canine drug detection program at 
Dominican airports and seaports. Despite recent improvements, however, a 
weak judicial system continues to hamper law enforcement efforts.
    In 1998, the GODR enacted legislation repealing a prohibition on the 
extradition of Dominican nationals and explicitly authorizing the 
extradition of nationals. The Dominican Republic subsequently extradited 
one of its nationals to the United States in 1998. We will continue to 
urge the GODR to act on a number of other U.S. extradition requests and 
to adopt a National Counter-Narcotics Master Plan.



Ecuador

    Ecuador continues to be a major transit country for the shipment of 
cocaine from Colombia to the United States and Europe. Traffickers also 
use Ecuador for money laundering of drug profits and to transit 
precursor chemicals destined for Colombian drug labs. Some poppy and 
coca fields have been found within Ecuador, but there are no indications 
that significant amounts of heroin or cocaine are produced.
    Although lack of adequate governmental funding for counter-narcotics 
programs and little interagency coordination are weak points, the 
Government of Ecuador (GOE) continued to demonstrate its cooperation and 
will

[[Page 265]]

ingness to work closely with the USG in countering narcotics trafficking 
and transshipments, chemical diversions, money laundering, and judicial 
corruption/inefficiency. The GOE has also stated its willingness to 
improve bilateral cooperation in maritime interdiction.
    The GOE has increased the effectiveness of its anti-narcotics 
activities by randomly deploying mobile road interdiction teams along 
Ecuadorian highways, a tactic which accounted for 40 percent of the 
drugs seized by the police. Successes for the national police included 
seizures of 42 kilograms of heroin and the seizure of 7.6 tons of 
cocaine from the Fishing Vessel DON CELSO. The GOE also deployed drug 
detector dogs at airports; inaugurated a Joint Information Coordination 
Center (JICC) in the major port city of Guayaquil; and passed 
legislation to combat corruption and inefficiency in the Customs 
Service. The Superintendent of Banks indicated strong interest in 
creating a joint task force to expedite interagency coordination in 
pursuing financial investigation regarding control of money laundering.
    To improve the professionalism and efficiency of its enforcement 
efforts, the GOE has created a judicial police unit to foster closer 
coordination with prosecutors. The GOE also plans to create a separate 
anti-narcotics police unit within the judicial police system to allow 
greater concentration of efforts in this field.



Guatemala

    President Arzu has taken Guatemala well down the road to 
reconciliation of its 36-year internal struggle. His efforts are now 
focused on combating violent crime, organized crime and other domestic 
issues. He has fully cooperated with the United States in combating 
counter-narcotics trafficking in Guatemala and in the region.
    Guatemala's location and scarce law enforcement resources facilitate 
its continued use by traffickers as a transshipment and storage point 
for cocaine destined for the United States via Mexico. Along with 
increased use of motor vehicle and container shipments, there has been 
an increase in airdrops of illicit drugs over Guatemalan territory for 
consolidation and transshipment. With USG assistance, the Department of 
Anti-Narcotics Police (DOAN) has stepped up training to react to air 
shipments and efforts to develop air interdiction capabilities. The 
expanding self-funded port security program and the trained DOAN agents 
made impressive seizures in the past year.
    The consolidation of the National Civilian Police (PNC) continues on 
track with full integration of the DOAN. The USG-trained DOAN seized 
almost 10 metric tons of cocaine in 1998. The drug prosecutor assistance 
program maintained its 90 percent conviction rate, with some traffickers 
receiving sentences of up to 20 years. The new drug prosecutor's field 
office in Quetzaltenango accounted for 110 successful prosecutions in 
1998.
    Guatemala is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and most GOG law 
enforcement activities are fully consistent with its goals and 
objectives. However, some of the Convention's provisions have not been 
codified into law and regulations, including provisions on extradition 
and money laun

dering. President Arzu has also been unsuccessful in gaining legislative 
support for ratification of a full maritime counter-narcotics agreement.
    In 1998, the Government of Guatemala (GOG) began implementation of 
its national drug policy, the anti-drug master plan, and national 
strategy which incorporates both demand and supply reduction objectives 
to be accomplished by specified ministries. The GOG provided additional 
funding to plan implementers to attack the alarming increase in drug 
abuse documented last year. The GOG also took major steps in 
implementing assets seizure and precursor chemicals regulations.



Haiti

    Haiti in 1998 made significant progress in a number of areas of 
counter-narcotics performance and cooperation, but a political impasse 
spanning the entire year precluded passage by Parliament of key antidrug 
laws and other important steps. Resource constraints--Haiti is the 
hemisphere's poorest country--and the lack of an effective judiciary 
also reduced the effectiveness of Haitian counter-narcotics efforts. As 
a result, Haiti fell short of agreed-upon counter-drug goals and cannot 
be certified as having fully cooperated with the United States or on its 
own to meet the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to 
which Haiti is a party. However, the vital national interests of the 
United States require that foreign assistance continue to be provided to 
Haiti.
    Haiti is a significant transshipment point for drugs, primarily 
cocaine, moving through the Caribbean from South America to the United 
States. The increased flow through Haiti is directly related to the 
success of interdiction operations in other parts of the region and the 
perception that the Government of Haiti (GOH) is ill-prepared to 
respond.
    The certification goals set, in consultation with GOH, for 1998 
were: to present to Parliament for passage a set of anti-drug 
trafficking laws, including money laundering and asset forfeiture, which 
were drafted in 1997; to begin implementing the ``National Master Plan 
for Combating Drugs in Haiti'' drafted in 1997; and to target at least 
one major international narcotics organization for significant 
enforcement action.
    Haiti did not meet two of these three goals, principally because of 
the prolonged political impasse between the executive and legislative 
branches, funding shortfalls, and insufficiencies in institutional 
structures. The political stalemate prevented the parliamenary 
ratification of a Prime Minister with executive authority throughout 
1998. This meant that, in accordance with the constitution, no new 
legislation, including the anti-drug laws and the National Master Plan, 
could be presented to the Parliament for enactment. (Indeed, the 
Parliament failed to act even on legislation clearing the way for 
significant new international loans, in which all Haitian parties 
presumably had an interest.)
    Although there was some implementation of elements of the Master 
Plan, GOH efforts to investigate, arrest, prosecute, or convict members 
of international drug trafficking organizations were lacking. This lack 
of success, however, must be understood in the broader context of 
Haiti's pervasive poverty, its dysfunctional judicial system, the still 
limited capabilities of

[[Page 267]]

the four-year-old Haitian National Police (HNP), and the inexperience 
and inadequacy of the two-year-old police anti-narcotics unit (BLTS).
    Although most of the specific goals set during the year were not 
achieved, Haiti's performance and cooperation with the United States 
improved significantly in a number of key areas. Haiti signed a Joint 
Information Coordination Center (JICC) agreement with the United States. 
The entire staffs of the JICC and BLTS were polygraphed. Under a DEA-
mentored task force concept, the flow of cocaine from Panama through 
Port-au-Prince airport has been reduced. Port-au-Prince's seaport is now 
the target of periodic inspections, including by U.S. Customs Service 
sniffer dogs in November. The HNP has indicated it will cooperate on the 
expulsion to the United States of third country nationals who are the 
subjects of U.S. indictments. The Haitian Coast Guard fully cooperated 
with the USCG ``ship rider'' program, and is increasingly demonstrating 
independent initiative at sea. The HNP counter-narcotics unit increased 
the quantity of drugs seized without direct USG assistance. The GOH also 
initiated the first joint Haitian-Dominican drug monitoring effort at 
the Malpasse-Jimani border crossing.
    A vital national interests certification is appropriate and 
necessary. A cutoff of U.S. bilateral assistance mandated by denial of 
certification would adversely affect vital U.S. national interests in 
Haiti, including ending the ongoing political crisis, promoting economic 
stability and democracy, and stemming the flow of illegal drugs and 
migrants to the United States.
    Denial of certification would terminate USG programs that provide 
critical support for Haiti's fragile economy. Without external 
assistance and the police mentoring that accompanies it, economic 
stability and growth would be jeopardized, with consequent renewed 
pressure on illegal immigration to the United States.
    USG and other international programs that go beyond counter-
narcotics assistance also address underlying problems in the Haitian law 
enforcement and judicial systems, especially endemic corruption and the 
lack of a strong professional tradition, that contribute to a weak anti-
drug performance. A cutoff of USG programs and the votes against 
multilateral development bank funding would undermine USG efforts and 
reduce the incentive for Haitian counter-narcotics entities to improve 
that performance.
    The risks posed to all of these U.S. interests by a cutoff of 
bilateral assistance outweigh the risks posed by Haiti's failure to 
cooperate fully with the USG or to take adequate steps on its own to 
combat illicit narcotics. Haiti's inability to fulfill key counter-
narcotics commitments in 1998 precludes full certification, but 
decertification would deny GOH many of the desperately needed resources 
to make progress in the counter-narcotics and other arenas.



Hong Kong

    Hong Kong traffickers continue to control large portions of 
Southeast Asian narcotics traffic, arranging both the financing and 
shipping of narcotics through Asian ports. In 1998, none of the heroin 
seizures in Hong Kong appeared destined for the U.S. market. No major 
heroin seizures in

[[Page 268]]

the United States had clearly transited Hong Kong. However, historical 
precedent, geographic location, transportation infrastructure, and trade 
activity suggest that Hong Kong remains an important factor in heroin 
supply to the United States.
    Hong Kong uses a multi-pronged strategy in combating drug 
trafficking and abuse, incorporating legislation and law enforcement, 
treatment and rehabilitation, preventive education and public awareness, 
and international cooperation. Money laundering, which often stems from 
drug trade proceeds, is a serious issue for the Hong Kong authorities. 
The Financial Action Task Force reviewed Hong Kong's financial system in 
April 1998. Hong Kong played an active role in reducing illicit 
trafficking of narcotics and precursor chemicals, another major concern, 
through its participation in the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs as part 
of the People's Republic of China delegation. During 1998, a new 
extradition treaty between the United States and Hong Kong entered into 
force. Hong Kong also signed mutual legal assistance agreements with 
several countries and, in December 1998, the United States ratified a 
Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement and a Prisoner Transfer Agreement with 
Hong Kong. Both agreements await legislative approval in Hong Kong.
    While trafficking and money laundering remain issues for Hong Kong, 
the authorities of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have 
launched serious efforts in all areas of enforcement and have been 
exemplary partners with the United States in the battle against 
narcotics.



India

    India, an important producer both of licit and illicit narcotics, is 
also a crossroads for international narcotics trafficking. There was no 
USG illicit poppy survey in India in 1998. Indian authorities claimed 
there were less than 100 hectares of illicit cultivation, but the last 
available USG surveys in 1996 and 1997 identified 3,100 and 2,000 
hectares of illicit opium poppy, respectively.
    India's location between the two main sources of illicit opium, 
Burma and Afghanistan, as well as its relatively well-developed 
transportation infrastructure, make it an ideal heroin transit point. 
There was credible evidence of large amounts of Burmese heroin being 
trafficked through India's northeastern border with Burma. However, 
there is no evidence at this time to indicate that opiates transshipped 
through India reach the United States in significant amounts.
    The Government of India (GOI) continues its progress in controlling 
the production and export of narcotics chemical precursors produced by 
India's large chemical industry. The GOI controls restrict access to 
acetic anhydride (AA), a chemical used to process opium into heroin. 
Nevertheless, there were unauthorized exports of essential chemical 
precursors and methaqualone (mandrax), a popular drug in Africa. Despite 
GOI precautions, in late 1998, there was growing evidence of AA entering 
Burma via India's porous Northeastern border for use in Burmese heroin 
refining. The GOI has a cooperative relationship with the DEA. However, 
there has been limited success in prosecuting major narcotics offenders 
because of

[[Page 269]]

the lack of enforcement funding and weaknesses in the intelligence and 
judicial infrastructure.
    In 1998, India took concrete steps to deter trafficking and control 
chemicals. The GOI systematically combatted illicit opium cultivation by 
combining remote sensing information with raids and the destruction of 
illicit crops. The Narcotics Control Board (NCB) continues to monitor 
industry manufacture and sales of controlled and precursor chemicals 
carefully, resulting in a price rise of precursor chemicals for illicit 
use. The NCB fully staffed three new zonal offices opened in 1996 along 
the border with Pakistan, and they are now fully operational. The zonal 
office in Imphal, Manipur, is also being fully staffed to add a greater 
enforcement presence in the northeast.
    GOI counter-narcotics officials increased their cooperation with 
drug liaison officers from countries in Europe, the Middle East and 
Africa to undertake a successful series of controlled delivery 
operations in 1998. These operations, many through parcel post, resulted 
in the arrest of more than 18 persons and the seizure of quantities of 
heroin, hashish, and methaqualone. The GOI has created the position of 
Joint Secretary for Narcotics in the Ministry of Finance reporting 
directly to the Revenue Secretary in order to tighten licit and illicit 
narcotics controls. This position has also increased the flow of 
information to Mini-Dublin Group countries and other bilateral and 
multilateral donors. Finally, to decrease the backlog of cases, the GOI 
continues to work with special state courts for narcotics matters, and 
federal narcotics enforcement officials continue to meet quarterly with 
their state government counterparts to share information and provide 
training. Federal efforts have spurred the formation of specialized 
narcotics units in state and metropolitan police agencies.
    India is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, but has not yet 
enacted supporting legislation on money laundering or asset seizure 
under civil law. This supporting legislation is now being prepared for 
resubmission to the Parliament. However, with the cooperation of UNDCP, 
the GOI hosted a regional conference on money laundering in New Delhi in 
March 1998. The conference focused on harmonizing regional efforts to 
fight money laundering and brought together experts from all over South 
Asia.
    In order to build on this progress, the USG will encourage GOI to 
take several important law enforcement steps in 1999. India needs to 
increase seizures of drugs sharply and to investigate and dismantle 
smuggling rings. The GOI should give increased priority to combating 
trafficking on the Indo/Burma border, which may be at least five metric 
tons of heroin per year. The GOI should pass the amendments to the 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) of 1985, 
introduced into Parliament in August 1997, which would modernize the 
criminal justice system.
    India is the world's largest producer of licit opiates for 
pharmaceutical use and the only producer of licit gum opium. The GOI 
continues to tighten its control over diversion of licit opium. However, 
some opium continues to be diverted from the country's legal production. 
The GOI estimates diversion at about 10 percent, although it may be as 
high as 30 percent. As a licit producer of opium, India must meet an 
additional certification requirement. In accordance with Section 490(c) 
of the Foreign Assistance Act, India may not be certified unless it 
maintains licit production and stockpiles at levels no higher than those 
consistent with licit market

[[Page 270]]

demand and has taken adequate steps to prevent significant diversion of 
its licit cultivation and production into illicit markets and to prevent 
illicit cultivation and production.
    Production and stockpile of licit opium in India has clearly not 
exceeded licit market demand. Indeed, India's stockpile has been barely 
adequate for some time and disastrous weather during the 1997-1998 poppy 
growing season, combined with a cultivator's ``strike'' which delayed 
planting, led to a 1998 harvest that is one of the smallest on record: 
about 260 metric tons (MT), well under even initial GOI estimates. To 
meet domestic and international licit demand, the GOI now concedes that 
it has been forced to ``completely exhaust'' its licit opium stockpile, 
leaving no carryover stock from 1998 whatsoever. This precarious 
situation makes an adequate 1999 harvest extremely important, and the 
USG is thus encouraging increased licit production.
    To meet India's share of anticipated world demand for licit opium in 
1999, and begin rebuilding domestic stockpiles to about 750 MT, the GOI 
plans to produce a licit opium harvest of at least 1300 MT in 1999, just 
below the 1997 record harvest. To meet this goal, the GOI has decided to 
reverse years of reductions in acreage (to improve control of diversion) 
and to sharply increase both the area under cultivation and the number 
of licit opium cultivators. Acreage will be increased by 32 percent; 
licit cultivators will more than double.
    In 1998, India took six important steps to increase licit opium 
production to meet market demand and rebuild the stockpile while 
curtailing the diversion of licit opium. These steps included: (1) 
sharply raising the number of hectares to be cultivated for the 1998-
1999 poppy growing season; (2) retaining the highest-ever minimum 
qualifying yield at 52 kilograms/hectare to discourage diversion from 
the licit crop; (3) raising the prices paid to opium cultivators to 
increase incentives for declaring and selling to GOI all licit opium; 
(4) expanding licit opium diversion controls to include re-surveys of 
plots after the planted crop reaches a particular stage of growth to 
ensure that the area under cultivation matches the amount of land 
licensed; (5) destroying cultivation more than five percent above the 
licensed amount with the cultivator liable for prosecution; and (6) 
raising licit opium diversion-related offenses by licensed cultivators 
to the level of trafficking offenses, with convictions resulting in 10 
to 20 years imprisonment and fines up to U.S. $6,000.
    While these are important steps to curb diversion, the USG believes 
even more must be done, given the significant planned increase in 
hectarage and farmers. The USG will work with the GOI to increase 
diversion controls. Despite the assent of a high-ranking GOI official in 
February 1998 to undertake a comprehensive joint opium yield survey with 
the USG, the GOI has not yet signed the necessary formal agreement. A 
joint licit opium survey would provide a firmer scientific basis for the 
GOI to set minimum qualifying yields (MQY) for licit opium farmers. More 
realistic MQYs would facilitate governmental controls on diversion and 
forecasting the supply of licit opiates.

[[Page 271]]




Jamaica

    Jamaica is a major transit point for South American cocaine en route 
to the United States and is also the largest Caribbean producer and 
exporter of marijuana. During 1998, the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) made 
some progress toward meeting the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention, to which it became a party in 1995. At regional 
meetings, GOJ officials actively supported counter-drug initiatives. 
Bilateral counter-drug cooperation is good and improving, especially in 
the area of maritime law enforcement. The U.S.-Jamaica bilateral 
maritime agreement, proposed by the USG in July 1995, came into force 
when Jamaica passed enabling legislation in February 1998. Jamaican 
forces participated in several combined operations under the new 
agreement.
    During 1998, the GOJ removed four persons to the United States, 
three by extradition and one under a waiver of extradition, compared to 
three removals in 1997. The USG and GOJ worked together to remove from 
the list of pending extradition requests all non-active cases, leaving 
17 pending requests for which the United States seeks early resolution.
    GOJ's cannabis eradication during 1998 was down only slightly from 
1997, despite a lack of helicopter and fixed wing air support. Marijuana 
and cocaine seizures and drug-related arrests increased significantly 
over 1997; hash oil seizures were down. The GOJ made a valuable 
contribution to regional anti-drug efforts by assuming funding of 
operating costs of the Caribbean Regional Drug Law Enforcement Training 
Center, located near Kingston and built with USG funding under a UNDCP 
project.
    In 1998, the Lower House of Parliament passed amendments to the 
existing anti-money laundering legislation; Senate action is pending. If 
passed by the Senate, the proposed amendments would raise the threshold 
for mandatory transaction reporting from U.S. $10,000 to U.S. $50,000 
equivalent, but would also introduce a new requirement that suspicious 
transactions in any amount be reported. Further GOJ action is required 
to bring its anti-money laundering law in line with international 
standards, especially extending the law to cover the laundering of the 
proceeds of all serious crime.
    Current Jamaican law requires the conviction of a criminal drug 
defendant prior to commencing a forfeiture action. The GOJ forfeited the 
house of a convicted drug trafficker in 1998. However, Jamaica's current 
asset forfeiture regime does not permit the GOJ to take full advantage 
of the forfeiture mechanism to augment the resources of its anti-drug 
agencies and deprive criminals of the proceeds of their crime.
    In 1998, the GOJ did not table in Parliament a precursor and 
essential chemical control law, despite stated commitments to do so for 
the last several years. However, the GOJ has budgeted for implementation 
of chemical controls, and the USG has already provided training to 
Jamaican precursor chemical control personnel. The GOJ did table in 
Parliament anti-corruption legislation, which is currently under debate. 
Corruption, especially among members of the security and law enforcement 
forces remains a serious problem in Jamaica, and the GOJ should take 
stronger action to prosecute corrupt individuals.

[[Page 272]]

    In 1998, the GOJ arrested 7,352 drug offenders, and the Supreme 
Court reported 10,290 convictions of drug offenders. However, even 
though GOJ counter-drug cooperation with DEA continued to be good, no 
Jamaican drug kingpins were arrested or convicted during 1998. The GOJ 
has agreed to develop in the coming year, with USG assistance, special 
units to target drug kingpins and apprehend fugitives from justice.
    The GOJ has in place a comprehensive national drug control strategy 
which covers both supply and demand reduction; the GOJ should add to its 
strategy specific goals and objectives and measures of effectiveness. 
The GOJ also should ratify the Inter-American Convention against 
Corruption, and, as it mandates, put in place legislation that requires 
financial disclosure by public officials. The GOJ also needs to take 
stronger steps to strengthen internal controls and investigate and 
prosecute corrupt members of the security and law enforcement forces.
    The USG will continue to provide technical assistance, training, and 
equipment to the GOJ to help strengthen its anti-drug, anti-money 
laundering and anti-corruption laws and enforcement capabilities. In 
addition, the USG will continue to assist the GOJ to address port 
security problems identified in a 1997 comprehensive assessment.



Laos

    Laos remains the world's third largest producer of illicit opium, 
trailing only Burma and Afghanistan. However, because small-scale 
subsistence farmers, without fertilizer, irrigation, or other 
agricultural improvements grow opium, Lao yields average less than half 
those found in neighboring Burma.
    For the 1998 growing season, although opium cultivation fell only 
seven percent, adverse weather conditions, which also affected opium 
production in Burma and Thailand, dramatically affected production 
levels. The United States estimates Lao potential opium production for 
1998 at 140 metric tons, down 33 percent from the previous year. 
Significant decreases in production can also be attributed to lower 
productivity per hectare due to crop substitution in project areas 
funded by foreign donors. These areas continued to show only low levels 
of opium cultivation, none of which was for commercial distribution, but 
rather was restricted to small amounts for local use.
    In January 1998, a heroin laboratory was seized in Bokeo province, 
the first such seizure this decade. In July, the position of Chairman of 
the Lao National Drug Commission was raised to ministerial rank. A DEA 
agent was assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane for the first time 
since 1975. Laos is not yet a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, but 
the government of Laos (GOL) has set a goal of ratification by the year 
2000.
    Laos' location next to the world's largest producer of opium and 
heroin (Burma), and its land borders with countries that combine 
important opium markets and ports on trade routes to Europe and the 
United States (China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia), make it an 
important route for drug trafficking. The GOL does what it can to combat 
trafficking and has shown itself ready to work very closely with the 
international donor community

[[Page 273]]

to attack the socio-economic problems underlying poppy cultivation in 
Laos. The GOL has already opened four Drug Control Units, and is 
determined to open one in each of the country's provinces.



Mexico

    Mexico made significant counter-narcotics progress in 1998. Building 
on presidential commitments made in May 1997, the United States and 
Mexico developed a Bi-National Drug Strategy--released in February 
1998--which identified sixteen areas for cooperation in reducing the 
illicit consumption, production and trafficking in drugs. Later in 1998, 
the two countries developed Performance Measures of Effectiveness for 
the Strategy to guide its implementation and to provide a means of 
monitoring progress. The Measures were formally adopted during President 
Clinton's trip to Mexico in February 1999. The U.S.-Mexico High-Level 
Contact Group on Narcotics Control (HLCG) and the Senior Law Enforcement 
Plenary continued to serve as the principal fora for coordination of 
bilateral counter-narcotics cooperation.
    USG agencies enjoy productive working relationships with Government 
of Mexico (GOM) counterparts across a broad range of counter-narcotics 
programs. The two governments have established numerous mechanisms, both 
formal and informal, to promote good communication and coordination.
    The most serious obstacles to both bilateral counter-narcotics 
cooperation and the effectiveness of Mexican agencies in combating the 
major drug cartels relate to institutional weaknesses, such as lack of 
adequate resources and training and widespread drug-related corruption. 
The GOM took a number of important steps in 1998 to address these 
problems. For example, for the first time ever, the Office of the 
Attorney General (PGR) implemented an intensive screening process for 
recruits to law enforcement as well as for all personnel assigned to 
sensitive positions. This level of screening will eventually be expanded 
to all PGR personnel. These kinds of reforms, along with bilateral 
training activities, are helping to build confidence between USG and GOM 
authorities, resulting in improved bilateral cooperation.
    The GOM also took steps during 1998 to implement important 
legislative reforms designed to enhance efforts against drug trafficking 
and organized crime. Among these steps were introduction of legislation 
regulating seized property to allow for asset forfeiture and sharing, 
streamlining the Mexican code of criminal procedure to facilitate 
prosecution of drug traffickers, and reducing the ability of employees 
dismissed for corruption to be reinstated upon appeal. In an effort to 
enhance professionalism and increase capabilities, Mexican law 
enforcement and judicial officials participated actively during 1998 in 
various bilateral training programs designed to improve management of 
evidence, electronic surveillance, asset forfeiture, drug detection, and 
fraud investigation.
    During 1998, Mexican authorities arrested numerous drug traffickers, 
including Jesus and Luis Amezcua (major methamphetamine traffickers 
wanted for extradition to the United States), twenty members of the 
Amado Carrillo Fuentes Organization (the Juarez Cartel), the former 
military com

[[Page 274]]

mander of Baja California, and two Federal Judicial Police chiefs. 
Notable convictions and sentences for drug-related crimes in 1998 
include former Drug Czar Army General Gutierrez Rebollo (sentenced to 
almost 14 years for offenses involving illegal possession and 
transportation of firearms and abuse of authority), and Ernesto ``Don 
Neto'' Fonseca Carrillo (sentenced on drug charges to 11 years, in 
addition to time he is serving for the 1985 murder of a DEA agent). Over 
10,000 Mexican nationals and 255 foreign nationals were arrested on 
drug-related charges.
    On the basis of legislation and regulations adopted in 1996-97, the 
GOM made progress last year in detecting and prosecuting instances of 
money laundering. The Financial Investigative Unit established in 1997 
in Mexico's Finance Ministry continued to work closely with USG 
counterparts on money laundering investigations, providing leads, 
follow-up and access to witnesses. With informational assistance and 
technical support from the USG, the GOM increased seizures of drug 
traffickers' assets in 1998, including a $250 million seizure of assets 
connected to Alcides Ramon-Magana in Cancun. Mexico's first successful 
prosecution for money laundering demonstrated encouraging progress in 
1998.
    The GOM sustained its massive interdiction and eradication programs 
throughout 1998. For example, Mexican law enforcement and military 
personnel seized 22.6 metric tons of cocaine and over 1,000 metric tons 
of marijuana. They eradicated for an entire growing season approximately 
9,500 hectares of opium poppy and 9,500 hectares of cannabis. The GOM 
continued cooperation with the USG in interdicting drug shipments 
throughout 1998. For example, during one major event, the GOM seized 
three tons of cocaine from a trafficking vessel forced to land by 
coordinated action by the U.S. Coast Guard and the Mexican Navy. In 
addition, bilateral cooperation in using U.S. air assets to detect and 
monitor drug flights increased in 1998.
    Both governments recognize that much remains to be done to dismantle 
the major international drug cartels, which pose such a serious threat 
to both nations. The criminal organizations based in Mexico are well 
financed and violent, placing Mexican law enforcement and military 
personnel at grave risk. The persistent corrupting influence of these 
groups is also an important concern for the GOM.
    President Zedillo has publicly underscored his commitment to combat 
drug trafficking and to strengthen Mexico's law enforcement 
institutions. He reaffirmed this commitment to U.S. officials, including 
in a June 1998 meeting with President Clinton at the UN General Assembly 
Special Session on Drugs. In February 1999, the GOM announced a major 
public security initiative which will significantly intensify the 
national anti-drug effort. Despite an austere budgetary situation, 
President Zedillo has directed the GOM to invest up to $500 million over 
the next three years on enhancements to the nation's capabilities to 
interdict drug shipments, to combat the major drug trafficking 
organizations, and to counter the corrupting influences that these 
organizations exert in both the public and private sectors. the 
initiative also calls for a major effort to address street crime and 
violence.
    The USG and the GOM have carefully nurtured positive working 
relationships, and the goodwill resulting from those efforts will remain 
essen

tial as both Governments continue to confront the shared threat of 
international drug trafficking.



Nigeria

    Nigeria has failed to fully meet the criteria for cooperation with 
the United States on counter-narcotics matters and has not taken 
adequate steps on its own to meet the goals of the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention. The vital national interests of the United States, however, 
require that Nigeria be certified in order that assistance, otherwise 
withheld, might be provided to support the transition to democratic 
civilian rule and the increased efforts to improve cooperation on 
counter-narcotics and other crime evident during recent months.
    Nigeria remains the hub of African narcotics trafficking. Nigerian 
criminal organizations operate global narcotics trafficking networks. 
They control sub-Saharan African drug markets, transport heroin from 
Asia to Africa, Europe and the United States, and transport cocaine from 
South America to Europe, Africa and Asia. Nigerian smugglers are 
responsible for a significant portion of the heroin used in the United 
States. Marijuana, the only narcotic grown in Nigeria, is exported to 
Europe and other African nations, but has little impact on the United 
States.
    Nigerian counter-narcotics efforts remain unfocused and lacking in 
material support. New head of state General Abubakar's strong public 
stand against narcotics trafficking and other crimes was a welcome 
change from past indifference, but has not yet resulted in new policies 
or action. The Government of Nigeria (GON) reaffirmed the existing 
bilateral basis for extraditions, but had not yet concluded any 
extraditions by the end of 1998. The 1995 National Drug Strategy remains 
unimplemented; wage increases that would have given law enforcement 
personnel a living wage for the first time in more than a decade were 
announced, but have not yet been implemented. Nigerian law enforcement 
continues to suffer from lack of material support, insufficient 
training, and widespread corruption.
    In 1998, there was some progress with the interdiction of low level 
couriers, gradual improvements in the capabilities of the National Drug 
Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), and the intensification of basic demand 
reduction efforts. The NDLEA made a number of seizures from individual 
couriers, but no major drug traffickers were prosecuted or convicted; 
total heroin seizures decreased. The increasingly sophisticated bulk and 
mail concealment methods of drug traffickers are moving beyond the 
capabilities of Nigerian law enforcement to detect them. The GON did not 
share counter-narcotics intelligence with the USG. A limited number of 
asset seizures were made, none against major traffickers or money 
launderers, and no asset seizures were prosecuted to conclusion. Nigeria 
has only just begun to acknowledge the depth of its own drug abuse 
problem. Demand reduction efforts have intensified with the opening of 
anti-drug clubs at Nigerian universities, and their endowment with anti-
drug literature and videos. Most of these efforts, however, are nascent 
and are hindered by the continuing misperception that drug abuse is a 
``foreign'' problem.
    Nigerian money launderers operate sophisticated global networks to 
repatriate illicit proceeds from narcotics trafficking, financial fraud 
and other

[[Page 276]]

crimes. Efforts to enforce the well-drafted money laundering decree were 
uneven and superficial, and did not result in any convictions or asset 
seizures that were prosecuted to conclusion.
    Nigeria is one of the most important countries in Africa. What 
happens in Nigeria politically and economically will, to a large degree, 
determine whether there is stability and progress toward democracy and 
economic reform in est Africa. If Nigeria's ongoing transition fails, it 
could easily result in an implosion of government and the collapse of 
the economy, triggering a humanitarian disaster in Africa's most 
populous country, with over 100 million people, and a destabilizing 
exodus of Nigerians to neighboring states. Such an upheaval could also 
disrupt the movement of high-quality Nigerian oil, which accounts for 
more than seven percent of total U.S. petroleum imports.
    If, on the other hand, Nigeria's transition succeeds, it will be an 
example to all of Africa, and has the potential to lead to economic 
growth and greater transparency in government. Nigeria could become an 
engine for growth in West Africa. A stable and democratic Nigeria will 
permit greater cooperation between law enforcement agencies, and the 
opportunity to reduce the impact of Nigerian criminals who prey on the 
American people.
    The military's acceptance of its appropriate role in a functioning 
democracy, and the new civilian government's ability to govern, will be 
critically impaired if Nigeria if deprived of the full range of U.S. 
support. Building a political consensus and meeting the challenges of a 
collapsing economy will also depend in no small part on outside 
assistance and expertise.
    Denial of certification would block assistance the new 
democratically-elected government will need to meet these challenges, 
seriously damaging the prospects for success of stable, transparent 
democracy in Nigeria. U.S. vital national interests require providing 
humanitarian, economic and security assistance to Nigeria as well as 
counter-narcotics assistance from all sources. The risk of not doing so 
now would jeopardize not only Nigeria's transition to democracy, but 
also Nigeria's attempts to reinvigorate its failing economy and support 
for democracy and peacekeeping throughout the region. Further, any new 
civilian government's ability to work with the United States on all 
issues, including counter-narcotics and other law enforcement, will 
depend on its access to multilateral lending and U.S. technical and 
economic assistance. The risks posed by the cutoff of assistance clearly 
outweigh the risks associated with GON's inadequate counter-narcotics 
performance over the past year.



Pakistan

    In 1998, Pakistan advanced toward its goal to eliminate opium poppy 
in the year 2000, by reducing opium poppy cultivation by 26 percent. The 
atmosphere for cooperation on drug control between Pakistan and the 
United States also improved significantly. Pakistan extradited two 
narcotics fugitives to the United States, whereas none were extradited 
in 1997.
    The Government of Pakistan (GOP) undertook an unprecedented poppy 
eradication campaign in some of its most inaccessible territory, which 
reduced cultivation by 26 percent and production by 24 percent and de

[[Page 277]]

creased the cultivation level to significantly below that of 1996. 
Despite financial constraints, the GOP ensured that wheat for planting 
alternative crops arrived in poppy-growing areas in time for the October 
planting, to forestall a return to poppy cultivation.
    Narcotics seizures were down, with heroin seizures down 48 percent. 
The GOP did, however, prevent the re-emergence of heroin/morphine 
laboratories in Pakistan, although some labs moved across the border 
into still chaotic Afghanistan. In November, the Prime Minister pledged 
to take steps to strengthen Pakistan's law enforcement agencies, 
particularly the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF).
    To meet law enforcement goals, a number of important arrests were 
made in 1998, including three individuals arrested in conjunction with 
heroin shipments that exceeded 100 kilograms. The GOP also arrested 
Faheem Babar, a major Lahore trafficker, whose arrest led to the 
discovery of an important drug trafficking organization operating with 
the alleged collaboration of at least one mid-level government official. 
Assets of drug traffickers totaling $5.8 million were frozen in 1998, 
and for the first time, a High Court ruled in favor of forfeiture of the 
assets to the government.
    The GOP took several important steps to strengthen law enforcement 
in 1998. The Control of Narcotics Substances Act and the Anti-Narcotics 
Forces Act were extended to the tribal areas of the Northwest Frontier 
Province, a major drug trafficking area. For the first time, Pakistan's 
anti-narcotics laws can be legally enforced in Pakistan's tribal areas. 
The GOP also approved cooperation with DEA for the establishment of a 
special vetted unit within the ANF.
    To meet extradition goals, the GOP extradited two drug traffickers 
on the extradition list and arrested three more. Many extradition 
requests remain problematic, as neither DEA nor the GOP have addresses 
for many extraditables within Pakistan. The GOP also requested 
certification that the cases were still pending in U.S. courts. To meet 
anti-corruption goals, in 1998, ANF removed 70 corrupt officials from 
its ranks.
    Pakistan's counter-narcotics performance improved in many aspects 
from last year's record. Independent of USG assistance, the GOP took a 
number of steps on its own to meet the goals and objectives of the 1988 
UN Drug Convention, including: extending the Control of Narcotics 
Substances Act and the Anti-Narcotics Act to tribal areas in the 
Northwest Frontier Province; freezing significant drug trafficking 
assets; arresting several major drug traffickers; and dismissing corrupt 
counter-narcotics officials.
    The GOP also actively and fully cooperated with the USG beginning in 
April to meet a number of important mutual counter-narcotics goals, 
including: an agreement with DEA to establish the special vetted unit; 
increased extraditions; arrests of some major drug traffickers; and the 
location of illicit poppy fields for the spring poppy eradication 
program.
    The GOP should take immediate steps to improve its performance in a 
number of areas, including: significantly improved narcotics seizures; 
convictions of major drug traffickers; closure of pending cases against 
two prominent drug offenders, Sakhi Dost Jan Notezai and Munawar Hussain 
Manj; concentration of law enforcement resources in investigations, 
arrests, prosecutions and convictions of drug kingpins; and steps to 
enact and implement the narcotics-related money laundering provisions of 
the Control

[[Page 278]]

of Narcotics Substances Act and to approve formally the Drug Abuse 
Control Master Plan.



Panama

    Panama is a major transit point for Colombian cocaine and heroin en 
route to the United States. Cocaine passes through Panamanian 
territorial waters concealed in fishing boats, ``go-fast'' boats and 
ocean freighters. Some of it is offloaded on the Panamanian coast and 
then transported by truck up the Pan American highway bound for the 
United States, or carried by couriers travelling by air to the United 
States and Europe.
    There is no evidence that any senior officials of the Government of 
Panama (GOP) are involved in drug smuggling. Nor does government policy 
encourage or facilitate drug-related criminal activity. However, the 
amount of drugs seized by Panama's neighbors to the north on the Pan 
American highway suggests either inadequate inspections or corruption on 
the part of GOP border officials. The judiciary, with its traditional 
susceptibility to political influence and threats, remains a concern 
because of plans for it to assume control of the Judicial Technical 
Police, the principal partner of USG counter-narcotics operations.
    The GOP continued implementation of its national counter-narcotics 
plan and its excellent cooperation with USG counterparts in 1998. 
Collection of information by the Financial Investigations and the 
Financial Analysis Units also improved during 1998. However, very little 
progress was made on bringing cases to prosecution. Panama remained 
active in international fora and associations targeting money laundering 
including the Egmont Group, the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force 
(CFATF), the Basel Committee's Offshore Group of Bank Supervisors, and 
the Commission Against Addiction and Illicit Drug Trafficking (CICAD) of 
the Organization of American States.
    In 1998, GOP officials seized 11.771 metric tons of cocaine and 22 
kilos of heroin. Although the lack of resources for counter-narcotics 
police remains a problem, with USG assistance, the facilities and 
equipment of the Panamanian National Maritime Service have been 
upgraded, facilitating the highest level of cooperation on maritime 
interdiction in the region. Maritime operations included several 
shiprider operations and numerous occasions of information sharing and 
cooperation on maritime drug interdiction.
    Highest priority in the coming year will be signing a maritime 
counter-narcotics agreement, achieving greater success in prosecuting 
money launderers, expanding money laundering legislation to include the 
profits of all crimes, and increasing interdiction capabilities of the 
Panamanian counter-narcotics police.



Paraguay

    Up to 40 metric tons of primarily Bolivian cocaine are estimated to 
transit Paraguay annually, en route through Argentina and Brazil to the 
United

[[Page 279]]

States, Europe and Africa. Paraguay is also a source country for high-
quality marijuana. Significant money laundering occurs, but it is 
unclear what portion is drug-related.
    In 1998, Paraguay signed a new bilateral extradition treaty with the 
United States that includes extradition of nationals. Modest 
improvements in counter-narcotics performance were achieved after the 
inauguration of the Cubas administration in August, such as the seizure 
of 215 kilograms of cocaine (more than the previous two years combined) 
and arrests of numerous low-level narcotics traffickers.
    However, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) failed to accomplish the 
majority of the agreed-upon counter-narcotics goals for 1998 in a manner 
sufficient for full certification. Paraguay did not implement its 
national drug control strategy through effective investigations leading 
to the arrest and prosecution of major drug traffickers, corrupt 
officials and their associates; drafted, but did not pass a revised 
anti-drug statute which includes provisions authorizing controlled 
deliveries and undercover operations, and criminalizes drug-related 
conspiracy; failed to effectively implement the new money-laundering 
statute; and failed to develop an effective anti-drug and organized 
crime investigative and operational capability for the tri-border area. 
In part, these shortcomings stem from the country having been distracted 
by the May elections and later by continued political turmoil over the 
status of former Army Commander, and unsuccessful 1996 coup plotter, 
Lino Oviedo.
    Denial of certification would, however, cut off assistance programs 
designed to meet the priority USG goal of strengthening Paraguay's 
democratic institutions and civil-military relations. This would reduce 
USG support for Paraguay's democracy at a time when it is being tested 
by conflict between the executive branch and the legislative and 
judicial branches, and calls by some Paraguayans for extraconstitutional 
measures. Denial of certification would also jeopardize ongoing 
cooperation and assistance programs with the GOP against other key areas 
such as intellectual property piracy and terrorism. Moreover, vital 
national interests certification would help promote the political will 
and positive action against narcotics trafficking that we continue to 
seek from the new Cubas administration.
    The risks posed to the totality of U.S. interests (i.e., promoting 
democracy, cooperation against intellectual piracy and continued 
counter-terrorism cooperation) by a cutoff of bilateral assistance 
outweigh the risks posed by GOP's failure to cooperate fully with the 
USG, or to take fully adequate steps to combat narcotics on its own.
    For 1999, Paraguayan counter-narcotics and anti-money laundering 
institutions need to be strengthened and given independence from 
political institutions and intrigue. With strong civilian leadership and 
cooperation among the President, congress and the courts, as well as 
adequate resources and legal authorities, the GOP could achieve all of 
its stated goals.



Peru

    Peru achieved a 26 percent decline in coca cultivation in 1998, 
yielding a total reduction of 56 percent since 1995. Eradication of 
illegal coca cul

[[Page 280]]

tivation reached an all-time record of 7,825 hectares, nearly doubling 
the Government of Peru (GOP) target goal of 4,000. In terms of 
hectarage, an estimated 51,000 hectares of coca cultivation remains, 
down from an estimated 115,300 hectares in 1995. In the past two years, 
a strong law enforcement program focused on trafficking organizations 
and transportation infrastructure, combined with an efficient coca 
eradication program, led to a collapse in coca leaf prices. The 
reduction in coca leaf prices prompted greater numbers of farmers to 
accept the economic alternatives to coca offered by the USG-Peru 
alternative development project, which continued to expand in 1998. 
However, coca leaf prices began to rise throughout Peru in August. This 
trend may reflect multiple factors, including new transportation 
methods, new markets for Peruvian drugs, natural market forces, and 
possibly increased cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) production in Peru.
    As traffickers have adapted and developed new smuggling methods on 
Peru's rivers, land borders and maritime routes, Peruvian counter-
narcotics agencies, the Peruvian National Police (PNP) and the Peruvian 
Coast Guard established several riverine counter-narcotics bases and 
increased resources for riverine operations. Cooperating with U.S., 
Colombian and Brazilian law enforcement personnel, PNP exchanged 
counter-narcotics intelligence and participated in joint law enforcement 
operations in the Amazonian tri-border area. The PNP, working in close 
cooperation with U.S. and other Andean counter-narcotics agencies, also 
pursued and arrested major drug trafficking organizations with both U.S. 
and international cocaine trafficking connections.
    The successful ``airbridge denial'' program has significantly shaped 
trafficking patterns in Peru and has caused the traffickers to develop 
alternative methods of transport to export drugs. While traffickers 
continue to fly large quantities of coca products out of Peru, 
particularly through Brazil, river and overland routes are increasingly 
used as intermediate steps in the export process. Overland routes, 
particularly north into Ecuador and south into Chile and Bolivia, are 
complementing maritime conveyance of drugs through Peru's coastal ports. 
The GOP is responding to the change by developing riverine and other 
counter-narcotics transit control strategies, using USG assistance and 
training.
    In 1998, the joint USG-GOP alternative development program operated 
in five valleys of Peru to strengthen local governments, provide access 
to basic services and promote licit economic activities, thereby 
establishing the social and economic basis for the permanent elimination 
of coca. A total of 239 communities have signed coca reduction 
agreements to reduce coca by approximately 16,300 hectares over a five-
year period. Two hundred more agreements are expected to be signed by 
the end of 1998. Licit economic activities involving assistance for more 
than 25,000 hectares of licit crops are focused on rehabilitating coffee 
and cocao plantations abandoned during the ``coca boom.'' One hundred 
thirty kilometers of rural roads and four bridges have been constructed. 
Other donors are expected to provide additional resources for 
infrastructure development.
    Donors participating in the November 1998 Peru Consultative Group in 
Brussels described Peru as a model of effective counter-narcotics 
policy, balancing interdiction with alternative development and 
demonstrating a willingness to make tough decisions required to achieve 
sustained illicit coca reduction. Of the $277 million for Peru's overall 
alternative develop

[[Page 281]]

ment and demand reduction programs, approximately $127 million 
represents funding by non-USG donors. This support will enable the GOP 
to undertake major programs in six new coca-producing valleys.
    Effective drug interdiction--especially strengthening ``airbridge 
denial''--and law enforcement remain the keys to maintaining coca leaf 
prices at unprofitable levels. The USG expects that low coca leaf prices 
will convince more farmers to abandon coca in favor of new crops or 
economic activities. Meanwhile, Peru's alternative development programs 
are designed to provide long-term, sustainable alternative economic 
opportunities which will discourage farmers from returning to coca 
cultivation. The GOP will need to increase security in areas still known 
for guerrilla activity and undertake a strong counter-narcotics effort 
to keep traffickers from interfering with alternative development 
efforts. Internal drug consumption is likely to increase, and the USG 
will continue to support the GOP's efforts to counter this growing 
problem.



Taiwan

    Given its role as a regional transportation/shipping hub in Asia, 
Taiwan is considered a significant transit point for drugs affecting the 
United States. Its geographical location also facilitates Taiwan 
nationals' involvement in international narcotics trafficking. Taiwan 
authorities make every effort to restrict this role, however, and 
routinely cooperate with U.S. enforcement activities.
    Although Taiwan's aggressive domestic counter-narcotics program 
continued, with an increase of 19 percent in the number of new cases 
investigated and the implementation of new counter-narcotics laws, the 
amount of drugs seized and the number of prosecutions in 1998 decreased 
substantially from 1997. Taiwan cannot be a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention because it is not a UN member. Nevertheless, over the last 
several years, Taiwan passed and implemented laws unilaterally bringing 
it into compliance with the Convention's goals and objectives. Taiwan 
also continued to expand counter-narcotics cooperation with U.S. law 
enforcement agencies through the American Institute in Taiwan.
    Taiwan is not a significant cultivator or producer of illegal 
narcotics, but the illegal consumption of both heroin and 
methamphetamine remains a serious internal social problem. Amphetamines 
were produced in Taiwan in the past, but aggressive police efforts in 
1998 and shifting market forces within the drug trade have forced 
producers to move their facilities to Mainland China. About 68 percent 
of the methamphetamine and 42 percent of the heroin seized on Taiwan 
during the first eleven months of 1998 originated in Mainland China.
    Kaohsiung Harbor, the world's third busiest container port, is a 
major center for shipping to and from Southeast Asian ports. Monitoring 
this traffic for smuggling is a difficult task. A significant percentage 
of the nearly six million TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) shipping 
containers at Kaohsiung port last year were ``in transit'' and, 
according to standard international practice, not subject to routine 
inspection by Taiwan Customs. Of the nearly 3 million containers legally 
entering and leaving Taiwan, Cus

[[Page 282]]

toms examined approximately 2 percent--a percentage comparable to that 
of other ports.



Thailand

    Throughout 1998, despite a serious domestic methamphetamine abuse 
problem and deep government budget cutbacks, Thailand continued its long 
tradition of cooperation with the United States and the international 
community in narcotics law enforcement and drug control efforts. 
Thailand cemented its role as a leader in regional drug control programs 
by co-establishing the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) with 
the United States in Bangkok. In 1998, legal and judicial cooperation 
also became more streamlined, additional defendants arrested in 1994's 
Operation ``Tiger Trap'' were extradited to the United States, and new 
cooperative law enforcement programs were initiated. Extradition to the 
United States of Thai citizens and residents who claim Thai citizenship 
continued to expand.
    The Royal Thai Government (RTG) has one of the most effective 
narcotic crop control programs in the world. USG analysts estimated that 
Thailand's opium production in the 1998 growing season declined 36 
percent to 16 metric tons. Cultivation decreased by 18 percent. 
Reflecting trends of previous years, opium farmers continue to cultivate 
smaller, more isolated fields and engage in multiple cropping to avoid 
eradication. A drought last year adversely affected the production of 
all agricultural commodities, including opium. The 1999 eradication 
campaign was inaugurated in mid-November 1998. Concentrated efforts will 
be necessary to destroy the poppy before it can be harvested. Activities 
related to heroin production, such as the refining of raw opium into 
morphine base, continued in northern border areas where drug producers 
often combined heroin operations with the manufacture of 
methamphetamine.
    Thailand has yet to become a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention 
due to its lack of anti-money laundering legislation. A draft bill is 
currently in a legislative committee where differences over the types of 
predicate crimes covered are being debated. The RTG remains committed to 
the passage of a law with as broad application as possible. Seizures and 
court actions under the asset seizure law continued. In 1998, with DEA 
support, the Thai Police established the first in a series of specially 
trained narcotics law enforcement units to target major trafficking 
groups. RTG programs aimed at treatment, epidemiology of substance 
abuse, and demand reduction were maintained and continue to be 
effective.



Venezuela

    Venezuela is a major transit country for over 100 metric tons of 
cocaine shipped annually from South America to the United States and 
Europe. Venezuela is also a transit country for chemicals used in the 
production of drugs in source countries. Venezuela is not a significant 
producer of illegal drugs, but small-scale opium poppy cultivation 
occurs near the country's border with Colombia.

[[Page 283]]

    In recent years, Venezuela's relatively vulnerable financial 
institutions and other sectors of the government have become targets for 
money laundering of illegal drug profits. U.S. Customs Operation 
``Casablanca'' identified Venezuela as one of the routes by which 
Colombian narco-traffickers launder drug proceeds through Venezuelan 
banks. Following arrests in May of Venezuelan bankers implicated in this 
case, the Government of Venezuela (GOV) expressed concern over the 
vulnerability of its financial sector and indicated a willingness to 
cooperate with the USG on follow-up investigations.
    In 1998, Venezuela sustained its efforts to combat narcotics 
trafficking and consumption. The National Anti-Drug Commission was 
instrumental in coordinating better implementation of existing 
legislation and lobbying for new, tougher counter-narcotics legislation.
    Actions by the GOV to intensify counter-narcotics efforts included: 
programs to implement a major reform of the judicial system due to take 
effect in July 1999; establishment of a central Financial Intelligence 
Unit; adoption of a unified regulatory system for chemical precursors; 
and passage of a new Customs law. Regrettably, efforts to gain passage 
of a Comprehensive Anti-Organized Crime bill were unsuccessful when the 
senate failed to pass the bill before congress adjourned for elections.
    The Venezuelan military continued cooperation with the USG in an 
aggressive campaign against small-scale opium cultivation that occurs in 
the Sierra de Perija area near Venezuela's northern border with 
Colombia. Two eradication operations in this area conducted in 1998 
reduced opium cultivation to less than 50 hectares.
    In October 1998, the GOV moved to reorganize the customs sector--a 
major element in controlling narcotics smuggling through ports and 
airports. The reform addresses all aspects of customs procedures and is 
expected to result in better control measures.
    Corruption in law enforcement and the judicial system continues to 
be a major problem. The GOV's judicial reform program is designed to 
reduce the opportunities for corruption in the judicial sector. 
Venezuela's new President, Hugo Chavez Frias, has included fighting 
corruption and combating drug transit as priorities for his new 
administration.



Vietnam

    Narcotics flow into Vietnam from drug-producing areas in Burma, 
Thailand, Laos, and China along Vietnam's long mountainous borders. Its 
location close to the ``Golden Triangle'' renders Vietnam an important 
transit route for heroin and more recently for amphetamines. Drugs 
entering the country are used locally and transshipped to other 
destinations. Increased availability of heroin and methamphetamine has 
fueled a sharp increase in domestic drug abuse.
    Trafficking through Vietnam continued at a high level in 1998, and 
may be increasing, but has been accompanied by a steady increase in 
arrests. Constant vigilance is necessary to assure corruption does not 
make the problem worse. The country is poor and suffers from a growing 
problem of trafficking, especially to school-aged children. Within the 
constraints of

[[Page 284]]

its limited resources, the Government of the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam (GOSRV) has endeavored to stem the flow of narcotic drugs to its 
own population and to work cooperatively with the world community, 
including the United States, in the counter-narcotics effort.
    Opium poppy cultivation appears to have declined in 1998, after an 
increase in 1997. In 1998, Vietnam began staffing its Drug Control 
Committee secretariat and approved a drug control action plan. Vietnam 
is highly supportive of bilateral and international cooperation to stem 
the flow of drugs into the country and sponsored two international 
conferences in Hanoi during the year. GOSRV also sent capable 
delegations to other international conferences.
    The USG and the GOSRV are expanding bilateral cooperation, including 
negotiating a counter-narcotics agreement and exchanging information on 
drug trafficking cases. The DEA will open an office in Hanoi in 1999.
    Vietnam is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, as well as the 
1961 UN Single Convention and its 1972 Protocol, and the 1971 UN 
Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

Notice of March 10, 1999

Continuation of Iran Emergency

On March 15, 1995, by Executive Order 12957, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to Iran pursuant to the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706) to deal with the threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, 
including its support for international terrorism, efforts to undermine 
the Middle East peace process, and acquisition of weapons of mass 
destruction and the means to deliver them. On May 6, 1995, I issued 
Executive Order 12959 imposing more comprehensive sanctions to further 
respond to this threat, and on August 19, 1997, I issued Executive Order 
13059 consolidating and clarifying these previous orders. The last 
notice of continuation was published in the Federal Register on March 6, 
1998.
Because the actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to 
threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States, the national emergency declared on March 15, 1995, must 
continue in effect beyond March 15, 1999. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran. Because the 
emergency declared by Executive Order 12957 constitutes an emergency 
separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 
12170, this renewal is distinct from the emergency renewal of November 
1998. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and 
transmitted to the Congress.

Efforts Relating to the Kosovo Conflict

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of Defense
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 552(c)(2) of the

to support international relief efforts for Kosovar refugees.

determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the

Notice of May 18, 1999

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to Burma

On May 20, 1997, I issued Executive Order 13047, effective at 12:01 
a.m., eastern daylight time on May 21, 1997, certifying to the Congress 
under section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and 
Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208), that the 
Government of Burma has committed large-scale repression of the 
democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 1996, thereby 
invoking the prohibition on new investment in Burma by United States 
persons, contained in that section. I also declared a national emergency 
to deal with the threat posed to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States by the actions and policies of the 
Government of Burma, invoking the authority, inter alia, of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706).
The national emergency declared on May 20, 1997, must continue beyond 
May 20, 1999, because the Government of Burma continues its policies of 
committing large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to Burma. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register 
and transmitted to the Congress.

Notice of May 27, 1999

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)

On May 30, 1992, by Executive Order 12808, President Bush declared a 
national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Governments of Serbia and 
Montenegro, blocking all property and interests in property of those 
Governments. President Bush took additional measures to prohibit trade 
and other transactions with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia 
and Montenegro) by Executive Orders 12810 and 12831, issued on June 5, 
1992, and January 15, 1993, respectively. On April 25, 1993, I issued 
Executive Order 12846, blocking the property and interests in property 
of all commercial, industrial, or public utility undertakings or 
entities organized or located in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro), and prohibiting trade-related transactions by 
United States persons involving those areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
controlled by Bosnian Serb forces and the United Nations Protected Areas 
in the Republic of Croatia. On October 24, 1994, because of the actions 
and policies of the Bosnian Serbs, I expanded the scope of the national 
emergency by issuing Executive Order 12934 to block the property of the 
Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory that they 
control within Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the property of any 
entity organized or located in, or controlled by any person in, or 
resident in, those areas.
On December 27, 1995, I issued Presidential Determination 96-7, 
directing the Secretary of the Treasury, inter alia, to suspend the 
application of sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro) pursuant to the above-referenced Executive 
orders and to continue to block property previously blocked until 
provision is made to address claims or encumbrances, including the 
claims of the other successor states of the former Yugoslavia. This 
sanctions relief, in conformity with United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1022 of November 22, 1995 (hereinafter the ``Resolution''), 
was an essential factor motivating Serbia and Montenegro's acceptance of 
the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
initialed by the parties in Dayton on November 21, 1995, and signed in 
Paris on December 14, 1995 (hereinafter the ``Peace Agreement''). The 
sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) were accordingly suspended prospectively, effec

[[Page 294]]

tive January 16, 1996. Sanctions imposed on the Bosnian Serb forces and 
authorities and on the territory that they control within Bosnia and 
Herzegovina were subsequently suspended prospectively, effective May 10, 
1996, also in conformity with the Peace Agreement and the Resolution. 
Sanctions against both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and 
Montenegro) and the Bosnian Serbs were subsequently terminated by United 
Nations Security Council Resolution 1074 of October 1, 1996. This 
termination, however, did not end the requirement of the Resolution that 
those blocked funds and assets that are subject to claims and 
encumbrances remain blocked, until unblocked in accordance with 
applicable law. Until the status of all remaining blocked property is 
resolved, the Peace Agreement implemented, and the terms of the 
Resolution met, the national emergency declared on May 30, 1992, as 
expanded in scope on October 25, 1994, and the measures adopted pursuant 
thereto to deal with that emergency must continue beyond May 30, 1999.
On June 9, 1998, following attacks and repression directed by the 
government in Belgrade against the people of Kosovo, I issued Executive 
Order 13088, ``Blocking Property of the Governments of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the Republic of Serbia, 
and the Republic of Montenegro, and Prohibiting New Investment in the 
Republic of Serbia in Response to the Situation in Kosovo.'' Since then, 
the government of President Milosevic has rejected the international 
community's efforts to find a peaceful settlement for the crisis in 
Kosovo and has launched a massive campaign of ethnic cleansing that has 
displaced a large percentage of the population and been accompanied by 
an increasing number of atrocities. In light of President Milosevic's 
brutal assault against the people of Kosovo, his complete disregard for 
the requirements of the international community and the threat his 
actions pose to regional peace and stability, I have determined that it 
is necessary to maintain in force these emergency authorities beyond 
June 9, 1999.
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency declared 
on May 30, 1992, as expanded on October 24, 1994, and the national 
emergency declared on June 9, 1998, with respect to the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). This notice shall be published in 
the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.

Memorandum of July 7, 1999

Action Under Section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974
Concerning Lamb Meat

Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of 
Agriculture, the United States Trade Representative, the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, [and] the Director of the National 
Economic Council
On April 5, 1999, the United States International Trade Commission 
(USITC) submitted a report to me that contained: (1) a determination 
pursuant to section 202 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 
``Trade Act''), that imports of lamb meat are being imported into the 
United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause 
of threat of serious injury to the domestic lamb meat industry; and (2) 
negative findings made pursuant to section 311(a) of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the ``NAFTA Implementation 
Act'') with respect to imports of lamb meat from Canada and Mexico.
After considering all relevant aspects of the investigation, including 
the factors set forth in section 203(a)(2) of the Trade Act, I have 
implemented ac

[[Page 299]]

tions of a type described in section 203(a)(3). I have determined that 
the most appropriate action is a tariff-rate quota on imports of lamb 
meat with an increase in currently scheduled rates of duties for imports 
within and above the tariff-rate quota level. I have proclaimed such 
action for a period of 3 years and 1 day in order to facilitate efforts 
by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import 
competition.
Specifically, I have established a tariff-rate quota for lamb meat in an 
amount equal to 31,851,151 kg. in the first year (July 22, 1999, through 
July 21, 2000), an amount that is equal to imports of lamb meat during 
calendar year 1998. The tariff-rate quota amount will increase by 
857,342 kg. annually in the second and third years of relief. I have 
also established individual country allocations for product imported 
from Australia, New Zealand, and an ``other country'' category within 
the tariff-rate quota, which reflect the actual shares of each country 
in calendar year 1998. I have established increased rates of duty for 
imports within the tariff-rate quota amount: namely 9 percent ad valorem 
for imports in the first year of relief; 6 percent ad valorem for 
imports in the second year; and 3 percent ad valorem for imports in the 
third year. I have established increased rates of duty for imports above 
the tariff-rate quota levels: namely, 40 percent ad valorem in the first 
year of relief, 32 percent ad valorem in the second year, and 24 percent 
ad valorem in the third year.
I have also determined that implementation of adjustment assistance 
measures based on authorized programs of the Department of Agriculture 
will facilitate efforts by the domestic lamb meat industry to make a 
positive adjustment to import competition. In this regard, I instruct 
the United States Trade Representative (the USTR), the Secretary of 
Agriculture (the Secretary), the Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget, and the Director of the National Economic Council, in 
consultation with the U.S. industry, to transmit to me a set of 
substantial adjustment assistance measures that would improve the 
competitiveness of the U.S. industry and facilitate efforts by the 
industry to adjust to import competition.
I further determine, pursuant to section 312(a) of the NAFTA 
Implementation Act, that imports of lamb meat produced in Canada and 
Mexico do not account for a substantial share of total imports of lamb 
meat and are not contributing importantly to the threat of serious 
injury. Therefore, pursuant to section 312(b) of the NAFTA 
Implementation Act, the safeguard measure will not apply to imports of 
lamb meat, whether fresh/chilled or frozen, that are the product of 
Canada or Mexico. Similarly, the safeguard measure will not apply to 
imports of lamb meat that are the product of Israel, beneficiary 
countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act or the Andean 
Trade Preference Act, or other developing countries that have accounted 
for a minor share of lamb meat imports.
I have determined that the actions described above will facilitate 
efforts by the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import 
competition and provide greater economic and social benefits than costs. 
These actions will provide the domestic industry with necessary 
temporary relief from increasing import competition as well as 
assistance from existing U.S. Government programs, while also assuring 
our trading partners continued access to the United States market. The 
over-quota tariff rates I have established will provide substantial 
certainty to the domestic lamb industry regarding import levels.

[[Page 300]]

Pursuant to section 204 of the Trade Act, the USITC will monitor 
developments with respect to the domestic industry, including the 
progress and specific efforts made by workers and firms to make a 
positive adjustment to import competition. The USITC will provide to me 
and to the Congress a report on the results of its monitoring no later 
than the date that is the mid-point of the period during which the 
action I have taken under section 203 of the Trade Act is in effect. In 
this regard, I instruct the USTR, in consultation with the Secretary, 
and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to transmit to 
the USITC no later than 30 days from today a list of benchmarks that the 
USTR recommends that the USITC use in connection with its monitoring and 
in preparing its report. These benchmarks are to be focused on industry 
efforts to adjust to import competition and on price trends for domestic 
and imported lamb meat.
The United States Trade Representative is authorized and directed to 
publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Notice of July 20, 1999

Continuation of Iraqi Emergency

On August 2, 1990, by Executive Order 12722, President Bush declared a 
national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Iraq. By 
Executive Orders 12722 of August 2, 1990, and 12724 of August 9, 1990, 
the President imposed trade sanctions on Iraq and blocked Iraqi 
government assets. Because the Government of Iraq has continued its 
activities hostile to United States interests in the Middle East, the 
national emergency declared on August 2, 1990, and the measures adopted 
on August 2 and August 9, 1990, to deal with that emergency must 
continue in effect beyond August 2, 1999. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Iraq.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of August 10, 1999

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Export Control
Regulations

On August 19, 1994, consistent with the authority provided me under the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), I 
issued Executive Order 12924. In that order, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States in 
light of the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as 
amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.). Because the Export Administration 
Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national emergency 
declared on August 19, 1994, must continue in effect beyond August 19, 
1999. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 12924.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Nationality Act

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
In accordance with section 207(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(the ``Act'') (8 U.S.C. 1157(b)), and after appropriate consultations 
with the Congress, I hereby determine that an unforeseen refugee 
emergency exists in Europe, and that the admission to the United States 
of Kosovar refugees in response to this emergency is justified by grave 
humanitarian concerns and is in the national interest. The admission of 
these refugees cannot be accomplished under the worldwide refugee 
admissions ceiling of 78,000 for Fiscal Year 1999, as authorized in 
Presidential Determination 98-39 of September 30, 1998, and an increase 
to 91,000 is warranted. The revised regional allocations are as follows:



          Africa                                   12,000
          East Asia                                 9,000
          Europe                                   61,000
          Latin America/Caribbean                   3,000
          Near East/South Asia                      4,000

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(l) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(1) (the 
``Act''), I hereby determine that:
    (1) an unforeseen emergency exists that requires immediate military

in the future participate in, ECOMOG; and
    (2) the emergency requirement cannot be met under the authority of 
the Arms Export Control Act or any other law except section 506(a)(1) of

Presidential Determination No. 99-36 of September 10, 1999

Presidential Determination on Continuation of the Exercise of Certain

Memorandum for the Secretary of State [and] the Secretary of the 
Treasury
Under section 101(b) of Public Law 95-223 (91 Stat. 1625; 50 U.S.C. App. 
5(b) note), and a previous determination made by me on September 11,

exercise of those authorities with respect to countries affected by:
    (1) the Foreign Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR part 500;

Notice of September 21, 1999

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to UNITA

On September 26, 1993, by Executive Order 12865, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions and 
policies of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
(UNITA), prohibiting the sale or supply by United States persons or from 
the United States, or using U.S. registered vessels or aircraft, or 
arms, related materiel of all

[[Page 306]]

types, petroleum, and petroleum products to the territory of Angola, 
other than through designated points of entry. The order also prohibits 
the sale or supply of such commodities to UNITA. On December 12, 1997, 
in order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 12865, I issued Executive Order 13069, 
closing all UNITA offices in the United States and imposing additional 
sanctions with regard to the sale or supply of aircraft or aircraft 
parts, the granting of take-off, landing and overflight permission, and 
the provision of certain aircraft-related services. On August 18, 1998, 
in order to take further steps with respect to the national emergency 
declared in Executive Order 12865, I issued Executive Order 13098, 
blocking all property and interests in property of UNITA and designated 
UNITA officials and adult members of their immediate families, 
prohibiting the importation of certain diamonds exported from Angola, 
and imposing additional sanctions with regard to the sale or supply of 
equipment used in mining, motorized vehicles, watercraft, spare parts 
for motorized vehicles or watercraft, mining services, and ground or 
waterborne transportation services.
Because of our continuing international obligations and because of the 
prejudicial effect that discontinuation of the sanctions would have on 
prospects for peace in Angola, the national emergency declared on 
September 26, 1993, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal 
with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 26, 1999. 
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to UNITA.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(1) of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2318(a)(1) (the

Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)(2) (the

    (1) as a result of an unforeseen emergency, the provision of 
assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act in amounts in excess of 
funds otherwise available for such assistance is important to the 
national interests of the United States; and
    (2) such unforeseen emergency requires the immediate provision of 
assistance under Chapter 6 of Part II of the Act.
Therefore, I direct the drawdown of up to $5 million in commodities and 
services from the inventory and resources of the Department of Defense 
for the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo.

determination to the Congress and to arrange for its publication in the

opportunities in regions and communities of Northern Ireland suffering 
from high rates of unemployment.

You are authorized and directed to transmit this determination, together 
with the attached statement setting forth a detailed explanation of the 
basis for this certification, to the Congress.

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(2) of the

Assistance Act, as Amended

Memorandum for the Secretary of State
In accordance with section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
(the ``Act'') (8 U.S.C. 1157), as amended, and after appropriate 
consultation with the Congress, I hereby make the following 
determinations and authorize the following actions:
The admission of up to 90,000 refugees to the United States during FY 
2000 is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the 
national interest; provided, however, that this number shall be 
understood as including persons admitted to the United States during FY 
2000 with Federal refugee resettlement assistance under the Amerasian 
immigrant admissions program, as provided below.
The 90,000 admissions numbers shall be allocated among refugees of 
special humanitarian concern to the United States in accordance with the 
following regional allocations; provided, however, that the number 
allocated to the East Asia region shall include persons admitted to the 
United States during FY 2000 with Federal refugee resettlement 
assistance under section 584 of the Foreign Operations, Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act of 1988, as contained 
in section 101(e) of Public Law 100-202 (Amerasian immigrants and their 
family members); provided further that the number allocated to the 
former Soviet Union shall include persons admitted who were nationals of 
the former Soviet Union, or in the case of persons having no 
nationality, who were habitual residents of the former Soviet Union, 
prior to September 2, 1991:


          Africa                                   18,000

          Unallocated                               6,000

The 6,000 unallocated numbers shall be allocated as needed to regional 
ceilings where shortfalls develop. Unused admissions numbers allocated 
to a particular region may be transferred to one or more other regions

regions to which the numbers are being transferred. You are hereby 
authorized and directed to consult with the Judiciary Committees of the 
Congress prior to any such use of the unallocated numbers or 
reallocation of numbers from one region to another.

of 1962, as amended, 22 U.S.C. 2601(b)(2), I hereby determine that 
assistance to or on behalf of persons applying for admission to the

contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States and 
designate such persons for this purpose.
An additional 10,000 refugee admissions numbers shall be made available 
during FY 2000 for the adjustment to permanent resident status under 
section 209(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1159(b))

humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.
In accordance with section 101(a)(42) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)) 
and after appropriate consultation with the Congress, I also specify 
that, for FY 2000, the following persons may, if otherwise qualified, be

    a. Persons in Vietnam
    b. Persons in Cuba

You are authorized and directed to report this determination to the 
Congress immediately and to publish it in the Federal Register.

Notice of October 19, 1999

Continuation of Emergency With Respect to Significant Narcotics 
Traffickers Centered in Colombia

On October 21, 1995, by Executive Order 12978, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
constituted by the actions of significant foreign narcotics traffickers 
centered in Colombia, and the unparalleled violence, corruption, and 
harm that they cause in the United States and abroad. The order blocks 
all property and interests in property of foreign persons listed in an 
Annex to the order, as well as foreign persons determined to play a 
significant role in international narcotics trafficking centered in 
Colombia, to materially assist in, or provide financial or technological 
support for or goods or services in support of, the narcotics 
trafficking activities of persons designated in or pursuant to the 
order, or to be owned or controlled by, or to act for or on behalf of, 
persons designated in or pursuant to the order. The order also prohibits 
any transaction or dealing by United States persons or within the United 
States in such property or interests in property. Because the activities 
of significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to 
threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the 
United States and to cause un

[[Page 314]]

paralleled violence, corruption, and harm in the United States and 
abroad, the national emergency declared on October 21, 1995, and the 
measures adopted pursuant thereto to respond to that emergency, must 
continue in effect beyond October 21, 1999. Therefore, in accordance 
with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
I am continuing the national emergency for 1 year with respect to 
significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Notice of October 29, 1999

Continuation of Sudanese Emergency

On November 3, 1997, by Executive Order 13067, I declared a national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by 
the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan. By Executive Order 
13067, I imposed trade sanctions on Sudan and blocked Sudanese 
government assets. Because the Government of Sudan has continued its 
activities hostile to United States interests, the national emergency 
declared on November 3, 1997, and the measures adopted on that date to 
deal with that emergency must continue in effect beyond November 3, 
1999. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national 
emergency for 1 year with respect to Sudan.

Notice of November 5, 1999

Continuation of Iran Emergency

On November 14, 1979, by Executive Order 12170, the President declared a 
national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the 
situation in Iran. Notices of the continuation of this national 
emergency have been transmitted annually by the President to the 
Congress and the Federal Register. The most recent notice appeared in 
the Federal Register on November 12, 1998. Because our relations with 
Iran have not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing 
the January 19, 1981, agreements with Iran is still underway, the 
national emergency declared on November 14, 1979, must continue in 
effect beyond November 14, 1999. Therefore, in accordance with section 
202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am 
continuing the national emergency with respect to Iran. This

[[Page 318]]

notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the

Notice of November 10, 1999

Continuation of Emergency Regarding Weapons
of Mass Destruction

On November 14, 1994, by Executive Order 12938, I declared a national 
emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States 
posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons 
(``weapons of mass destruction'') and the means of delivering such 
weapons. Because the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and 
the means of delivering them continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States, the national emergency first declared on 
November 14, 1994, and extended on November 14, 1995, November 12, 1996, 
November 13, 1997, and November 12, 1998, must continue in effect beyond 
November 14, 1999. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938.
This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted 
to the Congress.

Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 506(a)(2) of the

Notice of December 29, 1999

Continuation of Libyan Emergency

On January 7, 1986, by Executive Order 12543, former President Reagan 
declared a national emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States 
constituted by the actions and policies of the Government of Libya. On 
January 8, 1986, by Executive Order 12544, the President took additional 
measures to block Libyan assets in the United States. The President has 
transmitted a notice continuing this emergency to the Congress and the 
Federal Register every year since 1986.
The crisis between the United States and Libya that led to the 
declaration of a national emergency on January 7, 1986, has not been 
resolved. Despite the United Nations Security Council's suspension of 
U.N. sanctions against

[[Page 321]]

Libya upon the Libyan government's hand over of the Pan Am 103 bombing 
suspects, there are still concerns about the Libyan government's support 
for terrorist activities and its noncompliance with United Nations 
Security Council Resolutions 731 (1992), 748 (1992), and 88 (1993).
Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national emergency with 
respect to Libya. This notice shall be published in the Federal Register 
and transmitted to the Congress.
                                                    WILLIAM J. CLINTON  
THE WHITE HOUSE,
    December 29, 1999.

activity conducted by the agency.
    (b)(1) The agency, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may

<R05>
Sec. 102.140  Employment.

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of 
handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program 
or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and 
procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 
29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted 
programs or activities.


<R05>
Sec. 102.141-102.148  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 102.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 102.150, no qualified 
individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by 
the agency.


<R05>
Sec. 102.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so 
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph 
does not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing 
facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the 
agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment 
of significant historic features of an historic property; or
    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 102.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons

[[Page 331]]

forreaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an 
alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that 
would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would 
nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits 
and services of the program or activity.
    (b) Methods--(1) General. The agency may comply with the 
requirements of this section through such means as redesign of 
equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment 
of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at 
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and 
construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any 
other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily 
accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is 
not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where 
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. 
The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet 
accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural 
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any 
regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for 
meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority 
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified 
individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
    (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the requirements of 
Sec. 102.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give 
priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with 
handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property 
is not required because of Sec. 102.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative 
methods of achieving program accessibility include--
    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those 
portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible;
    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or 
through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made 
accessible; or
    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except 
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth 
the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide 
an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with 
handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals 
with handicaps;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

Sec. 102.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards 
of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established 
in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607,

<R05>
Sec. 102.160  Communications.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective 
communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal 
entities, and members of the public.
    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where 
necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to 
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity 
conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
individual with handicaps.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.
    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries 
by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate 
with persons with impaired hearing.
    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including 
persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to 
the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.
    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each 
of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 102.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the 
program or activity.

on the appeal.
    (k) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section 
may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
